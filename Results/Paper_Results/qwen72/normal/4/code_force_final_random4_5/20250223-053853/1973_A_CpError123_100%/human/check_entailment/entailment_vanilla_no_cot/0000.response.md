Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the total number of points and then determining the maximum number of draws. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly account for all the constraints and possibilities of the problem.

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c)` are even. If the total points are odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total cannot be achieved by any combination of draws and wins/losses.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2` and `y = a + b`, and then prints `min(x, y)`.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The maximum number of draws should be the maximum number of games that could have ended in a draw while still achieving the given scores.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- Each game can either result in a draw (1 point for each player) or a win/loss (2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser).
- The total number of points must be even.
- The maximum number of draws is the maximum number of games that could have ended in a draw while still achieving the given scores.

Here is the correct approach:
1. Calculate the total number of points `total_points = a + b + c`.
2. If `total_points` is odd, print `-1` because it's impossible to achieve an odd total with the given scoring system.
3. Calculate the maximum number of draws as `max_draws = (total_points - (c - a)) // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = (total_points - (c - a)) // 2
        print(max_draws)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the total points are even.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws as `(total_points - (c - a)) // 2`. This formula ensures that the difference in points between the highest and lowest scoring players is accounted for, and the remaining points are distributed as draws.

### Example:
- For the input `0 1 1`, the total points are `2`, which is even. The maximum number of draws is `1` because the only way to achieve this is with one draw between the second and third players.
- For the input `1 1 1`, the total points are `3`, which is odd. Therefore, the output is `-1`.
- For the input `3 4 5`, the total points are `12`, which is even. The maximum number of draws is `6` because the scores can be achieved with 6 draws and 0 wins/losses.

Thus, the original program is incorrect, and the corrected program should be used to solve the problem.
