Output State: The function will process each of the t test cases. For each test case, it will read three integers a, b, and c from the input. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, it will print -1 and continue to the next test case. Otherwise, it will calculate x as the integer division of the sum of a, b, and c by 2, and y as the sum of a and b. It will then print the minimum of x and y. After all iterations, the values of p_1, p_2, and p_3 will remain unchanged.
