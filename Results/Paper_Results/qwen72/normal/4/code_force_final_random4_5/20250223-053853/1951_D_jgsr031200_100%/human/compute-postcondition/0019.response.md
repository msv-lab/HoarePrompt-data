Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is assumed to be a constant).
- `costs` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is assumed to be a list of some values).
- `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `n // (n - k + 1)`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n - k + 1` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)` is `0 // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `k` is a constant and `1 - k` is not zero (otherwise, it would be undefined), `0 // (1 - k)` is 0.

2. **Calculate `n // 1`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // 1` is `0 // 1` which is 0.

3. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of `0 // (1 - k)` and `0 // 1`.
   - Both values are 0, so `h` is `0 + 0` which is 0.

4. **Check the condition `h >= k`**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - The condition `0 >= k` implies that `k` must be 0 or a negative integer for this condition to hold true. However, since `k` is not specified, we can only assume that the condition is satisfied in the context provided.

5. **Print `*costs`**:
   - The `print(*costs)` statement will unpack the list `costs` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact values of `costs` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `costs`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces. Since the exact values of `costs` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `costs`.

Output: **[elements of costs separated by spaces]**
