Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`. `h` is 0.**

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged.
