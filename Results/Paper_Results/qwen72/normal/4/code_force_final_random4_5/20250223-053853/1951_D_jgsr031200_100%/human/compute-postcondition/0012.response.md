The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. For the loop to execute, the list `costs` must contain at least one element. According to the given state, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n - k + 1` is always a positive integer, ensuring that `costs` has at least one element.

Therefore, the loop will execute, and the state of `i` will be the first element of `costs` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`. `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
