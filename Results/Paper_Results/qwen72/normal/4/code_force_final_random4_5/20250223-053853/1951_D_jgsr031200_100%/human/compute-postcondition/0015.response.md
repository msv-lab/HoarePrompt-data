Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (we don't know its exact value, but it is a constant).
   - `costs` remains unchanged (we don't know its exact value, but it is a constant).
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Calculate `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
     - `n // (1 - k)` becomes `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - Since `n` is 0, `0 // (1 - k)` is 0 for any value of `k` (as long as `k` is not 1, but we assume `k` is a constant and not 1).
   - `n // 1`:
     - `n // 1` becomes `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Condition `h < k`:**
   - We are given that `h` is less than `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, the condition `0 < k` must be true for the initial state to be valid.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the print statement `print('NO')`.
   - This print statement will always print 'NO' regardless of the values of `h` and `k`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the print statement will output 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
