Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (but its value is not specified).
   - `costs` remains unchanged (but its value is not specified).
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` = 0 - k + 1 = 1 - k.
     - `n // (1 - k)` = 0 // (1 - k) = 0 (since any integer divided by a non-zero integer is 0 if the numerator is 0).
   - `n // 1`:
     - `n // 1` = 0 // 1 = 0.
   - Therefore, `h` = 0 + 0 = 0.

3. **Condition:**
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Given `h` = 0, this implies that `k` must be 0 or less than 0 for the condition `h >= k` to hold true.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is simply `print(2)`.
   - This statement prints the integer 2.

Since the code snippet does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`, it will always print the integer 2 regardless of the initial state.

Output: **2**
