Output State: The function `func` processes all test cases, and for each test case, it prints the smallest integer `i` that is not present in the list `arr` or the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` after the first such integer has been found. The variables `n` and `arr` are reset for each test case, and the variable `mpp` is updated to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr` for each test case. The variable `first` is used to track whether a number that appears exactly once has been encountered. After all iterations, the state of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` is undefined for the next test case, but the overall sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.
