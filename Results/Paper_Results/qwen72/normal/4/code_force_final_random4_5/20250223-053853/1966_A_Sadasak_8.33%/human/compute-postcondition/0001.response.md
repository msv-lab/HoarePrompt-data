The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `num` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the first iteration. The `frequency_table` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
