### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, it is impossible to perform any exchange operations, so the program correctly prints `n` (the number of cards remains unchanged).
   - If `k == n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards (which is `k` cards) for `k - 1` new cards, reducing the total number of cards by 1.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - The frequency table is created by iterating through the `nums` list and counting the occurrences of each number.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k` to avoid unnecessary counting.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - After creating the frequency table, the program checks if any frequency is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform an exchange operation to reduce the number of cards by 1.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `n` (the original number of cards).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies:**
  - The program checks if any frequency is exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left.
  - The correct approach should be to use the frequency table to determine how many cards can be exchanged and how many will remain.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, you should:
  - Count the frequency of each card number.
  - Determine how many cards can be exchanged by repeatedly performing the operation on the most frequent card numbers.
  - The minimum number of cards left will be the remainder of the total number of cards after performing the maximum number of exchanges.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. It only checks if any frequency is exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        
        print(min_cards)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequency of each card number and performing the exchange operations as many times as possible.
