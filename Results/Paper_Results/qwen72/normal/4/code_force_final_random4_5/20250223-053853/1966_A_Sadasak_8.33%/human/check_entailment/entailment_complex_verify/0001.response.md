### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, it is impossible to perform any exchange operations, so the program correctly prints `n` (the number of cards remains unchanged).
   - If `k == n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards (which is `k` cards) for `k - 1` new cards, reducing the total number of cards by 1.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - The frequency table is created by iterating through the `nums` list and counting the occurrences of each number.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k` to avoid unnecessary counting.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - After creating the frequency table, the program checks if any frequency is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform an exchange operation to reduce the number of cards by 1.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `n` (the original number of cards).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies:**
  - The program only checks if any frequency is exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left.
  - The correct approach should be to use the frequency table to determine how many cards can be exchanged and how many will remain. Specifically, for each frequency `count` of a card number, you can perform `count // k` exchanges, each reducing the number of cards by `k - 1`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, you should:
  - Count the frequency of each card number.
  - Determine how many cards can be exchanged by repeatedly performing the operation on the most frequent card numbers.
  - The minimum number of cards left will be the remainder of the total number of cards after performing the maximum number of exchanges.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. It only checks if any frequency is exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the frequency of card numbers correctly to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the exchange operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
