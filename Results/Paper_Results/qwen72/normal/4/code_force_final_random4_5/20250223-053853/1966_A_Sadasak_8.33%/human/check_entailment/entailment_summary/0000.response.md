Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the specified operations. The logic provided in the program, however, does not correctly implement the required solution. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `k > n` by printing `n` (since no operation can be performed).
   - The program also correctly handles cases where `k == n` by printing `k - 1` (since one operation can be performed to reduce the hand to `k - 1` cards).

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the hand, but it caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency should not be capped; it should be used to determine how many operations can be performed on each card number.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency table does not necessarily mean that the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1`. The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of operations that can be performed and then determine the minimum number of cards left.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each card number, calculate how many complete operations can be performed (i.e., how many times `k` cards of that number can be chosen).
   - After performing the operations, the remaining cards for that number will be the total number of cards of that number modulo `k`.
   - Sum the remaining cards for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
