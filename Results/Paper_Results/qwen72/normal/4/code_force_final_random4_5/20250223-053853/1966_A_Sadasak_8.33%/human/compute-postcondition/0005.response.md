The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. `arr` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 100, and each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 100. `k` is an integer between 2 and 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, but capped at `k` if the frequency exceeds `k`.
