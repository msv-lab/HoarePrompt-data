Reasoning:

The program aims to solve a problem where you have a hand of cards, and you can perform an operation to exchange a set of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in your hand.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `k > n`, it means you cannot perform any operations because you don't have enough cards to form a set of `k` cards. Therefore, the number of cards left is `n`, which is correct.
   - If `k == n`, it means you can perform the operation exactly once, exchanging all `n` cards for `k-1` new cards. Thus, the number of cards left is `k-1`, which is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` but caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is because any frequency greater than `k` can be reduced to `k` by performing the exchange operation multiple times.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency of `k`. If so, it means you can perform the operation at least once, reducing the number of cards by 1 (since you exchange `k` cards for `k-1` cards). Therefore, the number of cards left is `k-1`, which is correct.
   - If no card number has a frequency of `k`, the program outputs `n`, which is incorrect. This is because the program should consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards further by performing multiple operations.

The issue with the program is in the final output logic. If no card number has a frequency of `k`, the program should not simply output `n`. Instead, it should calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally. The correct approach would be to sum the frequencies of all card numbers that are less than `k` and add the remainder of the division of the total number of cards by `k` to this sum.

Correctness: **False**

To fix this, the program should be modified to handle the case where no card number has a frequency of `k` more accurately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards = sum(v % k for v in freq.values()) + (n // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```

This corrected version calculates the minimum number of cards left by summing the remainders of the frequencies when divided by `k` and adding the number of complete `k`-sized sets times `k-1`. This ensures that the program correctly handles all cases.
