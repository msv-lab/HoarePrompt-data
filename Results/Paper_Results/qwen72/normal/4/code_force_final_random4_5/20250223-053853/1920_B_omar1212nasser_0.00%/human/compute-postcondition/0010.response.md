The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= removals <= len(elements)` and `0 <= negatives <= len(elements)`. `elements` is a list of integers.

- **Case_1**: If the conditions for `removals` and `negatives` are not met, the function returns `0`.
- **Case_2**: If the conditions for `removals` and `negatives` are met, the function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * n`, where `s` is the sum of the remaining integers in `elements` after subtracting the last `removals` integers, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. If the conditions for `removals` and `negatives` are not met, it returns `0`. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos` containing `removals + 1` elements, each calculated as `s - 2 * n`, where `s` is the sum of the remaining integers in `elements` after removing the last `removals` integers, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list.**
