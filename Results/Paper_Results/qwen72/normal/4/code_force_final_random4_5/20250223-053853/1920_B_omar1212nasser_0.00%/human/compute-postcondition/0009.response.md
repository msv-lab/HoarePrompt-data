Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of the remaining integers in `elements` after subtracting the last `removals` integers, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list.**
