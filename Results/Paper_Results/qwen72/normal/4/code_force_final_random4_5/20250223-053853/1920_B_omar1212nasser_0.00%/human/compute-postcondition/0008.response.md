Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` remain non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, where each element is `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop, `s` is the sum of the remaining integers in `elements` after subtracting the last `removals` integers, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the updated `elements` list.**
