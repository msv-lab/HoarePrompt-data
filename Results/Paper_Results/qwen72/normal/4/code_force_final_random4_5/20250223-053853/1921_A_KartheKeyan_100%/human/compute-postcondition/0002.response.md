The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is 0 after the loop, and `s` is calculated and printed for each iteration as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, where `l` is taken as input for each iteration**
