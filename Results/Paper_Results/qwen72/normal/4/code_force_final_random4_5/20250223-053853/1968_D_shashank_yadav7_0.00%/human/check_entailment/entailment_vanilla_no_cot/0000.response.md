Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha using a loop that iterates `k` times. However, the logic used to update the scores (`bm` and `sm`) is flawed. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     are incorrect. These lines are trying to add the maximum of the current score and a calculated value, which does not reflect the actual game rules. The score should simply be incremented by the value at the current position in the array `a`.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop decrements `k` by 1 on each iteration, but the loop condition should be based on the number of turns, not the remaining turns. The loop should run exactly `k` times, not until `k` becomes 0.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect. The positions should be updated using `p[b]` and `p[s]` directly, as the positions are 0-indexed after the initial subtraction.

4. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variables `sp` and `bp` are used but are not necessary for the correct calculation of the scores. They are not used in the final comparison and can be removed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading:** The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`, followed by the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
- **Position Adjustment:** The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to be 0-indexed.
- **Score Calculation:** The scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated by iterating `k` times, adding the value at the current position in `a` to their respective scores, and then updating their positions based on the permutation `p`.
- **Comparison and Output:** After the loop, the scores are compared, and the appropriate result is printed.

This corrected program should correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules.
