### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the input values `n` and `k` directly within the function, which is not ideal. It would be better to pass these values as parameters to the function. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program's logic for the given problem.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The program constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the alphabet string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program generates `s = 'abcabc'`.

3. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The program's goal is to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the string `s = 'abcabc'` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `2` using the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, the string `bc` is not a subsequence of `s = 'abcabc'`.

4. **Correct Output Example:**
   - The correct output for `n = 2` and `k = 3` should be a string like `abcbac`, which contains all possible subsequences of length `2` using the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

5. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program's approach of repeating the first `k` characters `n` times does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in the resulting string `s`.
   - For a given `n` and `k`, the number of possible subsequences of length `n` is \( k^n \). The program's approach does not account for the combinatorial nature of generating all possible subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not generate a string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
