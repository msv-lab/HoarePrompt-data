Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is calculating something that is not related to the problem statement. Specifically, it is calculating a sum involving the square root of `n` and some integer division, which does not correspond to the conditions of the problem:

1. The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
2. The pairs `(a, b)` must satisfy the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different value, which is not relevant to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
