The function `oacm` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all n and m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^6.
