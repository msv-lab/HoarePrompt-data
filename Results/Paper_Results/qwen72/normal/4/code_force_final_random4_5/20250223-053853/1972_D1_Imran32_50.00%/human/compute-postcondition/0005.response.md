Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is equal to the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` in the range from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
- `n`, `k`, and `root` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initialized to the value of `n`.
   - Then, for each `i` in the range from 2 to `root` (inclusive), the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is computed and added to `ans`.

2. **Expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\)**:
   - This expression performs integer division of \((n + i)\) by \((i * i)\).
   - Integer division `//` means the result is the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.

3. **Summation**:
   - The summation is performed for all `i` from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - The result of each \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is added to `ans`.

### Final Value of `ans`:
- `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` in the range from 2 to `root` (inclusive).

### Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `root` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the value of `ans` as described.

Output: **ans (where ans is the initial value of n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i in the range from 2 to root (inclusive))**
