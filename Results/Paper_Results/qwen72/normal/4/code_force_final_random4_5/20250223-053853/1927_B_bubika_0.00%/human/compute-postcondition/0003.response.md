Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of integers where each element is incremented by the number of times its corresponding index in `a` was used in the output strings `r` during the loop iterations.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged because it is only used as the loop counter.
- The variable `n` is reset to its initial value for each iteration of the outer loop, so it remains within the specified range.
- The string `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `b` is modified within the inner loop. For each integer `i` in the list `s`, the corresponding index `x` in `b` is found, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1. This means that after all iterations, each element in `b` will be incremented by the number of times its corresponding character in `a` was used in the output strings `r`.
