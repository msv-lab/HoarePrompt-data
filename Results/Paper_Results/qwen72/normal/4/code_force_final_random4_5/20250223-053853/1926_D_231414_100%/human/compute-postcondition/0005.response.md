Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The function then computes the number of unique integers in the list `a` after applying a specific transformation (XOR with `2^31 - 1`) and prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no remaining state. **
