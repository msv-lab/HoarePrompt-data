The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the function signature. Typically, for the given constraints, the function should accept at least `t`, `x`, and `y` as parameters. Assuming the function signature should be `def func(t, x, y):`, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
