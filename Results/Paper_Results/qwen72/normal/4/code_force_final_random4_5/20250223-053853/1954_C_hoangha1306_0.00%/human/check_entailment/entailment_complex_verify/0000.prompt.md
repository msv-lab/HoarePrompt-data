You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs two strings, `kq1` and `kq2`, which are derived from the input strings `a` and `b`. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed such that for each position where `a` and `b` have the same digit, `kq1` and `kq2` will have that same digit. For positions where `a` and `b` differ, the first differing position will be handled such that the smaller digit is placed in `kq1` and the larger digit in `kq2` if `vt` is 0. For all subsequent differing positions, the larger digit is placed in `kq1` and the smaller digit in `kq2`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` and `b` are of equal length and contain digits from 1 to 9. The function then constructs two new strings, `kq1` and `kq2`, such that for each position where `a` and `b` have the same digit, `kq1` and `kq2` will have that same digit. For the first position where `a` and `b` differ, the smaller digit is placed in `kq1` and the larger digit in `kq2`. For all subsequent differing positions, the larger digit is placed in `kq1` and the smaller digit in `kq2`. Finally, the function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits in `a` and `b` are not in the same order but can still be swapped to maximize the product. For example, consider the input:

```
1
123
321
```

The expected output should be:

```
321
123
```

However, the program will output:

```
321
123
```

This is incorrect because the program should swap the digits to maximize the product, which in this case would be:

```
321
321
```

The program fails to consider all possible swaps to maximize the product, and instead, it only swaps based on the current digit being greater or smaller, which does not always lead to the maximum product.
