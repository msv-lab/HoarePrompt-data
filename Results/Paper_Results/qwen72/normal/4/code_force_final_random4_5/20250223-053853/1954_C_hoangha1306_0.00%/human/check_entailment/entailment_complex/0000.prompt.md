Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        kq1 = ''
        
        kq2 = ''
        
        vt = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    if a[i] > b[i]:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        
        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs two strings, `kq1` and `kq2`, which are derived from the input strings `a` and `b`. The strings `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed such that for each position where `a` and `b` have the same digit, `kq1` and `kq2` will have that same digit. For positions where `a` and `b` differ, the first differing position will be handled such that the smaller digit is placed in `kq1` and the larger digit in `kq2` if `vt` is 0. For all subsequent differing positions, the larger digit is placed in `kq1` and the smaller digit in `kq2`. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` and `b` are of equal length and contain digits from 1 to 9. The function then constructs two new strings, `kq1` and `kq2`, such that for each position where `a` and `b` have the same digit, `kq1` and `kq2` will have that same digit. For the first position where `a` and `b` differ, the smaller digit is placed in `kq1` and the larger digit in `kq2`. For all subsequent differing positions, the larger digit is placed in `kq1` and the smaller digit in `kq2`. Finally, the function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
