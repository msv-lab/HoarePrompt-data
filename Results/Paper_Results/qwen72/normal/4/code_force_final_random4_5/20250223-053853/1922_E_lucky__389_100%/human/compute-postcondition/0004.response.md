The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and the current value of `x`, but these variables and objects are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the integer `1` being printed.

Output: **1**
