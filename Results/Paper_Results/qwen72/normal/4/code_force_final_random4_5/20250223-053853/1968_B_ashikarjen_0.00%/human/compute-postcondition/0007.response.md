To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to understand the initial state and the variables involved:

- `a` and `b` are strings that remain unchanged.
- `n` and `m` are the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively.
- `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order.
- `j` is the index in `b` where the next unmatched character would be found, or `m` if all characters in `b` have been checked.

Given this information, let's break down the value of `k`:

1. **Matching Characters**: `k` is the count of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order. This means that for each character in `a`, if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, `k` is incremented.

2. **Order of Matching**: The characters must match in the same order, which implies a direct comparison of characters at the same indices in `a` and `b`.

3. **Final Value of `k`**: The value of `k` will be the number of indices where the characters in `a` and `b` are the same.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the given information, the `print(k)` statement will output the count of matching characters in the same order between `a` and `b`.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order)**
