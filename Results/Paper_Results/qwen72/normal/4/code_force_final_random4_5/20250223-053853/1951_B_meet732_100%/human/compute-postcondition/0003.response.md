To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and each integer \(a_i\) is distinct and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `x` is equal to `a[k]` (where `k` is some index in the list `a`).
- `ind` is an empty list.
- `c` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

### Adjustments:
- The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `n` is already greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

### Conclusion:
Since `n` is already greater than 0 and `i` will start at 0, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient to ensure the loop will run.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and each integer \(a_i\) is distinct and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0**
