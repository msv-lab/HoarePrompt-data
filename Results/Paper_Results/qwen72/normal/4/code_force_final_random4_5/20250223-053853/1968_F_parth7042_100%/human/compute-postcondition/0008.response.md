The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a series of queries. The parameters and their constraints are as follows:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
  - `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, where 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30.
  - Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r`, where 1 <= l < r <= n.

The function returns the results of the queries for each test case. The specific output for each query is not provided, but it is implied that the function processes the list `a` and the queries to produce some result based on the sublists defined by the query indices `l` and `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `q`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It also accepts `q` queries, each represented by two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns the results of the queries for each test case, processing the list `a` and the query indices `l` and `r` to produce the output.**
