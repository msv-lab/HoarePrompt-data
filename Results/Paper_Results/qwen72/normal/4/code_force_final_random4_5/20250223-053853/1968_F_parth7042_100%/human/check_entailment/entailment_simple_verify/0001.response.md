### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for large inputs.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list. This is a common technique to handle multiple test cases and queries in a single input.
   - The initial call to `func_1()` is placed before the function definition, which is incorrect and would cause a runtime error. This should be moved to the end of the script.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This is done using the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         a[i] = int(data[index])
         index += 1
         pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
         mp[pf[i]].append(i)
     ```
   - The prefix XOR array helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray `a[l] to a[r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - The `mp` dictionary is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs, which is useful for checking the existence of valid split points.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l] to a[r]` using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x == 0`, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part has a XOR of 0, which is trivially interesting. The program correctly appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x != 0`, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the appropriate indices in the `mp` dictionary.
   - The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that there is a valid split point between `l` and `r` where the XOR of the segments can be equal.

4. **Output:**
   - The program collects all the results in a list and prints them at the end using `print('\n'.join(results))`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and parsing, except for the initial function call placement.
- The prefix XOR array is correctly computed and used to efficiently answer the queries.
- The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is correct. It correctly identifies when the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the required indices in the `mp` dictionary.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is mostly correct, but the program has a minor issue with the placement of the initial function call. This issue would cause a runtime error if the script is run as is.
- However, assuming the function call is placed correctly (at the end of the script), the program is correct and should work as intended.

Final: **False** (due to the initial function call placement issue, which would cause a runtime error). If the function call is moved to the end, the program would be correct, and the final evaluation would be **True**.
