To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **`ii`**: This is the loop variable that will be incremented from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
2. **`int(input())`**: This represents the number of test cases, `t`, which must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` is `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `ii` is 0 (the loop variable starts at 0).
- `t` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop executes at least once).

State: **`ii` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
