### Reasoning:

1. **Objective**: The program aims to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program starts by finding an index `ans1` that, when ORed with itself, is the maximum among all indices.
   - It then finds a set of indices `v` that, when ORed with `ans1`, produce the same maximum value.
   - Finally, it selects the index `ans` from `v` that, when ORed with itself, is the maximum among the indices in `v`.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Initialize `ans1` to 0. For each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), compare \(p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\). If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, update `ans1` to \(i\). This step ensures that `ans1` is the index with the maximum value of \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - **Step 2**: Initialize `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0. For each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), compare \(p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\). If \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\) is greater, update `mx` to \(i\) and reset `v` to contain only \(i\). If \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\) is equal to \(p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1}\), append \(i\) to `v`. This step ensures that `v` contains all indices that, when ORed with `ans1`, produce the maximum value.
   - **Step 3**: Initialize `ans` to `v[0]`. For each index \(i\) in `v` starting from 1, compare \(p_{ans} \mid p_{ans}\) with \(p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}\). If \(p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}\) is greater, update `ans` to `v[i]`. This step ensures that `ans` is the index with the maximum value of \(p_i \mid p_i\) among the indices in `v`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: This step correctly identifies an index `ans1` such that \(p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1}\) is the maximum among all indices. This is because the OR operation of a number with itself is the number itself, and the maximum value of \(p_i\) will be the maximum value of \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - **Step 2**: This step correctly identifies all indices `v` that, when ORed with `ans1`, produce the maximum value. This is because the OR operation is commutative and associative, and the maximum value of \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\) will be the same for all indices that have the same maximum value when ORed with `ans1`.
   - **Step 3**: This step correctly identifies the index `ans` from `v` that, when ORed with itself, is the maximum among the indices in `v`. This is because the OR operation of a number with itself is the number itself, and the maximum value of \(p_i\) among the indices in `v` will be the maximum value of \(p_i \mid p_i\).

5. **Query Count**:
   - **Step 1**: \(n-1\) queries.
   - **Step 2**: \(n-1\) queries.
   - **Step 3**: At most \(|v|-1\) queries, where \(|v|\) is the number of indices in `v`. Since \(|v|\) is at most \(n\), this step uses at most \(n-1\) queries.
   - **Total**: \(3n-3\) queries, which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\) queries.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices `ans` and `ans1` such that \(p_{ans} \oplus p_{ans1}\) is maximized. This is correct because `ans` and `ans1` are chosen based on the maximum values of the OR operations, which indirectly helps in finding the maximum XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the problem's requirements. It uses the allowed number of queries and correctly identifies the indices with the maximum XOR value.

**Correctness: True**
