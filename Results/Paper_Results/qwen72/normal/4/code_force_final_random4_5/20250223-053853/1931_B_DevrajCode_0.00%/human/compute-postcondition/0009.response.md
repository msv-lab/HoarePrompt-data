The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer with a range of 1 to 200,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, where each integer `a_i` is in the range of 0 to 1,000,000,000 (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of all integers in the list `a` is divisible by `n`.

The function returns 'No' in Case_1 and 'Yes' in Case_2. Since the function has multiple return points, we need to describe the conditions under which each case is met.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' if a certain condition is not met, and 'Yes' if the condition is met.**
