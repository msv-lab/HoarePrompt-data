The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `water` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `total_water % n` is equal to 0
- `target` is equal to `total_water // n`
- `container` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect the conditions at the start of the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element in the list `a`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0**
