### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Check**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - This approach is correct for the given problem, but it assumes that the input is structured in a way that all test cases are concatenated into a single input string, which is not typical for multiple test cases. However, for the sake of this problem, we will assume this is the intended input format.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` (the number of containers) and `a` (the list of water amounts in each container).
   - It calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.
   - The target amount of water for each container is calculated as `total_water // n`.

3. **Water Redistribution Check**:
   - The program initializes a variable `container` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - It iterates through each water amount in the list `a` and updates `container` by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount, and there is no way to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water to balance the amounts. Therefore, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to balance the water amounts, and the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, the variable `container` should be 0 if the water amounts can be balanced. This is because the sum of the differences between each container's water amount and the target amount should be zero if the water can be evenly distributed.

### Correctness:
The program correctly checks if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
