Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' if at any point during the iteration over the elements of `a`, the cumulative difference between each element and the target value (which is the average of the elements in `a`) becomes negative. If the cumulative difference is non-negative for all elements, the function returns 'Yes'. **
