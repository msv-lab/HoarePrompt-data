Output State: **`container` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `water` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, `container` is updated by adding the difference between `water` and `target`.
- Since `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a` and `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is the average value of the elements in `a`.
- The sum of all the differences `(water - target)` over all elements in `a` is zero because the sum of `water` values equals `total_water`, and the sum of `target` values (which is `n * target`) also equals `total_water`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `container` will be zero, and the loop will not return 'No' because `container` will never be negative.
