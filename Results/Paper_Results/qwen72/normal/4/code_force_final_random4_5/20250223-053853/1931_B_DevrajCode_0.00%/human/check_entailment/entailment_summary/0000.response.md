Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed pouring operations. The key insight here is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, `n`. This means that there exists a target amount of water, `target`, that each container should have if the water can be evenly distributed.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the `target` as the average of the total water in the containers. However, the logic used to determine if the water can be evenly distributed is flawed. The function iterates through the list `a` and maintains a cumulative difference, `container`, which is the sum of the differences between each container's water and the target. If at any point `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. This logic is incorrect because it only checks if the cumulative difference is non-negative, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that all containers can be made to have the same amount of water.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, so the target is always an integer.
- We need to check if it's possible to move water from containers with more than the target to containers with less than the target, ensuring that no container has less water than the target at any intermediate step.

The correct approach would be to:
1. Calculate the target.
2. Iterate through the list and keep track of the cumulative water difference.
3. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we cannot pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water without violating the condition `i < j`.

However, the provided function does not correctly implement this logic. It only checks if the cumulative difference is non-negative, which is not enough to ensure that the water can be evenly distributed. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
