The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of ships `n`, the number of Kraken attacks `k`, and a list `a` of ship durabilities. The function then simulates the Kraken attacks on the ships and prints the number of ships that have been destroyed after `k` attacks. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will hold the values from the last test case processed.
