Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It takes into account the number of yogurts `n`, the regular price per yogurt `a`, and the promotional price for two yogurts `b`. The program calculates the total cost in two ways:
1. Buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
2. Buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining at the regular price (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).

It then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case. This approach ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for any valid input within the specified constraints.
