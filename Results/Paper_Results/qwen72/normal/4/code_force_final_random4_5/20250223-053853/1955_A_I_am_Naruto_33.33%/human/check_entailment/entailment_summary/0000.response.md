Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the problem of determining the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`.
3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
4. **Minimum Cost**: The program then prints the minimum of these two costs, which is the correct approach to find the least expensive way to buy `n` yogurts.

The logic is sound and matches the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing the input and producing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
