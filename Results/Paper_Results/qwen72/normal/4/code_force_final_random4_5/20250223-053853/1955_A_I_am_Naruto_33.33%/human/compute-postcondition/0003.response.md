Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. For each test case, if `n > 1`, it calculates the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` and prints this minimum value. If `n == 1`, it simply prints `a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were provided in the input. **
