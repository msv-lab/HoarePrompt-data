The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each of these four integers by 2, and adds 1 to the sum if exactly three of the first three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. The result of this calculation is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are no longer relevant as they are read and processed for each test case.
