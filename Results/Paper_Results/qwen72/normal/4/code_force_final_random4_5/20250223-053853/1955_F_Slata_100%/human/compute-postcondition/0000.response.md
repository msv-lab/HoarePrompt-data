The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted. The state `t` and `p_i` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each of the four integers p_i in the test cases is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
