### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of zero with any number is the number itself: \( 0 \oplus x = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in a way that keeps the XOR of the remaining sequence as zero as often as possible.
   - The key observation is that the XOR of the sequence can be influenced by the parity (odd or even) of the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( a, b, c, d \) representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the number of pairs of each number that can be removed without changing the XOR (since \( x \oplus x = 0 \)).
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the parities of \( a, b, \) and \( c \) is 3. If it is, it means there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, and one of these can be removed to make the XOR zero.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - The additional term correctly checks for the case where removing one of the odd-count numbers can make the XOR zero.
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
