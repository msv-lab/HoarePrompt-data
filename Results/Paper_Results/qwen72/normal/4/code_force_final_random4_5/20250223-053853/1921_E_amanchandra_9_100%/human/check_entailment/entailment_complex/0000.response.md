### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `r` (height), `w` (width), `a` (Alice's row), `b` (Alice's column), `c` (Bob's row), and `d` (Bob's column).

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The function first checks if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If this is true, the game will end in a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, and they will never meet.

3. **Calculating Moves:**
   - If Alice's chip is not below Bob's chip, the function calculates the number of moves `x` it would take for Alice to reach Bob's row. This is done using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - The function then checks if the number of moves is odd or even, which affects the possible positions where Alice and Bob can meet.

4. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), the function calculates the range of columns where Alice and Bob can potentially meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice's column `b` is within this range and prints "Alice" if it is, otherwise "Draw".

5. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is even, the function calculates the range of columns where Alice and Bob can potentially meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's column `d` is within this range and prints "Bob" if it is, otherwise "Draw".

6. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure that the calculated columns `l` and `r` stay within the board's dimensions.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
- It handles the edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (i.e., Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row) by ensuring that the game ends in a draw if Alice's chip is below Bob's chip.
- The logic for determining the winner based on the number of moves and the positions of the chips is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
