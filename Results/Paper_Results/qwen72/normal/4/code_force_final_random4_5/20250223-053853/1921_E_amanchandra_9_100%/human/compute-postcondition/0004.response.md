Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of six integers: `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips. The function determines the winner of a game based on the positions of the chips and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input values and the state of the program remain unchanged. **
