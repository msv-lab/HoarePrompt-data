Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program checks if `m` (the visibility duration) is less than either `a` or `b` (the firing intervals) and prints `2` if this condition is true. However, this does not account for the correct scenario where the visibility of fireworks from both installations might overlap.

For the general case where `m >= a` and `m >= b`, the program calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen by summing the number of times each installation can fire within `m` minutes and then adds `2`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the overlap of visibility times correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to understand when both installations fire at the same time. We also need to consider the visibility duration `m` to determine how many fireworks from each installation can be visible at the same time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: We use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM is the smallest time at which both installations will fire simultaneously.
2. **Visibility Calculation**: We calculate the number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation within the visibility duration `m + 1` minutes. We subtract the number of times both installations fire simultaneously to avoid double-counting.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the overlap of visibility times and provides the correct maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
