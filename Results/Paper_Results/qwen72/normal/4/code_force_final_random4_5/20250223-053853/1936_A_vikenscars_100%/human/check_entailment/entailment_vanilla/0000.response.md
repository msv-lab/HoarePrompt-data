### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries, where each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
   - The goal is to use these queries to find the indices with the maximum XOR value.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function sends a query to the interactor and returns the result of the comparison.
   - **func_2:** This function is responsible for finding the indices with the maximum XOR value.
     - **Step 1:** It first finds the index of the maximum item in the permutation by comparing each item with the current maximum item using the bitwise OR operation. This is done to identify the largest value in the permutation.
     - **Step 2:** It then tries to find the second index that, when XORed with the maximum item, gives the maximum result. It does this by comparing the bitwise OR of the maximum item with the current pair index and the maximum item with each other index.
     - **Step 3:** If the result of the comparison is less than, it updates the pair index.
     - **Step 4:** If the result is equal, it further compares the pair index with the current index to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

3. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times to find the maximum item.
   - The second loop runs \(n\) times to find the pair index.
   - The total number of queries is \(2n - 1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum item in the permutation.
   - It then correctly identifies the pair index that, when XORed with the maximum item, gives the maximum result.
   - The algorithm ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the limit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the algorithm correctly identifies the pair \((0, 1)\) or \((1, 0)\) since \(p_0 \oplus p_1\) is the only possible XOR value.
   - For larger \(n\), the algorithm should also work correctly as it systematically compares all possible pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It finds the indices with the maximum XOR value using at most \(3n\) queries.

**Correctness: True**
