The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^4. The function also accepts parameters `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, which are integers in the range [0, n-1]. However, the provided code snippet does not show the output or return value of the function. Without this information, it is not possible to accurately describe the functionality of the function.

If we assume that the function returns some value based on the given parameters, we would need more details about the output to provide a complete description. For now, we can only describe what the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and two integers `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the range [0, n-1].**
