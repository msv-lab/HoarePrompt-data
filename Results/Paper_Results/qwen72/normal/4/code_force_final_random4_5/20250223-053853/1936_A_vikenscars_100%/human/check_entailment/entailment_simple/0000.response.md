### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation \(p\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives the result.
   - The query format is `? a b c d` and the response is one of `<`, `=`, or `>`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function aims to find the maximum XOR pair using the queries.
   - **Step 1: Finding the Maximum Item Index (`max_item_idx`):**
     - The function iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of the current maximum item with itself and the current index with itself.
     - If the result is `<`, it means the current index \(i\) has a higher value, so `max_item_idx` is updated to \(i\).
   - **Step 2: Finding the Pair Index (`pair_idx`):**
     - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It then iterates through all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` with the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and the current index \(i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it means the current index \(i\) has a higher value, so `pair_idx` is updated to \(i\).
     - If the result is `=`, it further compares the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself and the current index \(i\) with itself to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum value in the permutation \(p\) by comparing the bitwise OR of each element with itself.
     - This is because \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\), and the maximum value in the permutation will be the one that is greater than all others.
   - **Finding the Pair Index:**
     - The second loop aims to find the index \(j\) such that \(p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
     - The approach is to compare the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with `pair_idx` and `max_item_idx` with the current index \(i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it means \(p_i\) is a better candidate for the pair.
     - If the result is `=`, it further checks if \(p_i\) is a better candidate by comparing the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself and \(i\) with itself.
   - **Output:**
     - The function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` as the final answer.
     - This approach ensures that the maximum XOR pair is found within the allowed number of queries (3n).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
