### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The interactor is not adaptive, meaning the permutation \( p \) is fixed and does not change during the interaction.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and receives the comparison result.
   - It constructs the query string and prints it with `flush=True` to ensure the output is immediately sent to the interactor.
   - It then reads the input from the interactor and returns it.
   - This function is correctly implemented and follows the interaction protocol.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n)` is the main function that finds the indices \( i \) and \( j \).
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0, which will hold the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - The first loop iterates through the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find the index of the maximum element by comparing `p[max_item_idx]` with `p[i]` using the bitwise OR operation.
     - If `p[max_item_idx] | p[max_item_idx] < p[i] | p[i]`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
   - After finding the maximum element, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - The second loop iterates through all indices again to find the index `i` that maximizes \( p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_i \).
     - It uses the bitwise OR operation to compare `p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx]` with `p[max_item_idx] | p[i]`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it further compares `p[pair_idx]` with `p[i]` using the bitwise OR operation to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find the maximum element.
   - The second loop makes \( n \) queries to find the pair that maximizes the XOR.
   - The total number of queries is \( 2n - 1 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
   - However, the algorithm does not necessarily find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR. The bitwise OR operation used in the queries does not directly help in maximizing the XOR operation.
   - The XOR operation is maximized when the two numbers have the most differing bits. The current approach only ensures that the bitwise OR of the maximum element with some other element is maximized, which is not the same as maximizing the XOR.
   - Therefore, the algorithm may not always find the correct pair of indices that maximizes the XOR.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) maximizes \( p_i \oplus p_j \). The use of bitwise OR in the queries does not guarantee the correct maximization of the XOR operation.

Final: **False**
