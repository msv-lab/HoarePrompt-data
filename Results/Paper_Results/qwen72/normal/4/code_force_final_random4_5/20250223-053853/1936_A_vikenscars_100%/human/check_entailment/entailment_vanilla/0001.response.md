### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The interactor is not adaptive, meaning the permutation \( p \) is fixed and does not change during the interaction.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and receives the comparison result.
   - It constructs the query string and prints it with `flush=True` to ensure the output is immediately sent to the interactor.
   - It then reads the input from the interactor and returns it.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n)` is the main function that finds the indices \( i \) and \( j \).
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0, which will hold the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find the index of the maximum element by comparing `p[max_item_idx]` with `p[i]` using the bitwise OR operation.
   - After finding the maximum element, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates through all indices again to find the index `i` that maximizes \( p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_i \).
   - It uses the bitwise OR operation to compare `p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx]` with `p[max_item_idx] | p[i]`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further compares `p[pair_idx]` with `p[i]` using the bitwise OR operation to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find the maximum element.
   - The second loop makes \( n \) queries to find the pair that maximizes the XOR.
   - The total number of queries is \( 2n - 1 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
   - It then correctly identifies the index that maximizes the XOR with the maximum element.
   - The number of queries is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
