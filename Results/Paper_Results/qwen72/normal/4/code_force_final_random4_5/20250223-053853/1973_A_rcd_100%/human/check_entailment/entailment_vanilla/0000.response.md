### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
     - This is because the highest score player could have won all games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn all their games against each other.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws.
     - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
     - The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop.
     - If not, it increments `x` and decrements `y` to try the next possible combination of draws.
     - If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (all scores are 0) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 10`) by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
