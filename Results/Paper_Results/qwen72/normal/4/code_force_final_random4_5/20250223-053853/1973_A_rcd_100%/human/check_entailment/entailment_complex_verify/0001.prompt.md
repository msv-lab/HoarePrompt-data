You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. Depending on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, it will print one of the following: -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, `p1 + p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, or the result of a calculation involving `x` and `y` if neither of the above conditions are met. After all iterations, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last values read from the input, and `x` and `y` will be the last values calculated in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then prints a result for each test case: -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, `p1 + p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, or a calculated value based on the scores if neither of the above conditions are met. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the last values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` used in the last iteration of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
     - This is because the highest score player could have won all games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn all their games against each other.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws.
     - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
     - The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop.
     - If not, it increments `x` and decrements `y` to try the next possible combination of draws.
     - If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (all scores are 0) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 10`) by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
