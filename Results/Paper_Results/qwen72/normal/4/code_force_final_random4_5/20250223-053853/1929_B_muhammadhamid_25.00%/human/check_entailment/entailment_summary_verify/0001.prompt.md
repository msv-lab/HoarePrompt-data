You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, it prints either 1, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, or `k` divided by 2 plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in scope.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Special Case \( k = 1 \):**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to ensure that at least one diagonal has a colored cell.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing 1 and continuing to the next test case.

3. **General Case \( k \leq 2n \):**
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells along the main diagonals (both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal) to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have a colored cell.
   - The number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) because each cell can cover two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal), and we need to round up to ensure we cover at least \( k \) diagonals.
   - The program correctly handles this case by using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.

4. **General Case \( k > 2n \):**
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to color additional cells beyond the main diagonals.
   - The program calculates the number of cells needed as \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because:
     - \( k // 2 \) cells can cover \( 2 \times (k // 2) \) diagonals.
     - We need one more cell to cover the remaining \( k \% 2 \) diagonals.
   - This calculation ensures that we cover at least \( k \) diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - \( 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):
     - \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \):
     - \( 11 // 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( 3 // 2 + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
