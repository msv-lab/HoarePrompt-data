To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition `l + 1 < r`. The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`.

- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `arr`.

For the loop to execute, `l + 1` must be less than `r`. Given that `l` is 0, this means `1 < r` must be true. Therefore, `r` must be greater than 1.

Since `r` is the length of `arr`, `arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `arr` and `r` must be greater than 1**
