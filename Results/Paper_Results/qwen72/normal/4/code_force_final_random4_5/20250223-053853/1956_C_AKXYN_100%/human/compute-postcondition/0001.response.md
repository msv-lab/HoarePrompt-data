Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `res` for each test case will hold the value of the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and the value of `n << 1` will be printed alongside `res`. Additionally, for each test case, two lines are printed for each value of i from n to 1: the first line starts with '1' followed by the value of i and the range from 1 to n, and the second line starts with '2' followed by the value of i and the range from 1 to n. The matrix `mat` and the loop variable `_` are not relevant to the final output state.**
