### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- The operations are:
  1. Assign a permutation to a row.
  2. Assign a permutation to a column.
- The maximum possible sum is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} \), where \( a_{i,j} \) can be any integer from 1 to \( n \).

#### Correct Maximum Sum:
- The maximum sum is achieved when every element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).
- Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
- The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it initializes a matrix `mat` with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
- It calculates a value `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
- It prints `res` and \( 2n \) (which is `n << 1`).
- It then prints \( 2n \) operations, alternating between row and column operations, using the same permutation for each operation.

#### Evaluation of `res` Calculation:
- The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is not the correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix.
- The correct maximum sum is \( n^3 \).

#### Evaluation of Operations:
- The program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
- However, the operations are not necessarily optimal for maximizing the sum.
- The program assigns the same permutation to both rows and columns, which does not ensure the maximum sum.

#### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 2 \):
  - The program calculates `res` as \( 1 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
  - The program prints:
    ```
    7 4
    1 2 1 2
    2 2 1 2
    1 1 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    ```
  - The matrix after these operations will be:
    ```
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), which is not the maximum possible sum of 8.

- The correct output for \( n = 2 \) should be:
  ```
  8 3
  1 1 2 1
  1 2 2 1
  2 1 2 1
  ```
  - The matrix after these operations will be:
    ```
    2 1
    2 1
    ```
  - The sum of this matrix is \( 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), but with a different permutation, we can achieve:
    ```
    2 2
    2 2
    ```
  - The sum of this matrix is \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \), which is the maximum possible sum.

#### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum.
- The operations used by the program do not ensure the maximum sum is achieved.
- The program uses more operations than necessary in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
