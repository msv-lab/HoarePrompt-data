Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: The function initializes a matrix `mat` with rows and columns ranging from 1 to `n`. However, this matrix is not used in the subsequent operations or output, which is not a problem since the operations and the sum calculation are independent of the matrix state.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum sum `res` using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\). This formula is derived from the fact that each row and column will be filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), and the sum of all elements in such a matrix is \(n \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). The function's formula simplifies to the same result.
4. **Output Format**: The function prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is \(2n\)). This is correct as the problem specifies that the number of operations should not exceed \(2n\).
5. **Operations Printing**: The function prints \(2n\) operations, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations, for each value of `i` from `n` to 1. This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

Given the above points, the function correctly handles the input, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the required number of operations in the correct format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
