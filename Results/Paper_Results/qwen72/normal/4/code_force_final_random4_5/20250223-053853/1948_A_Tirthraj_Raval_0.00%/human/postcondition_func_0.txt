The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the input, representing the number of special characters required in the string. For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case.
