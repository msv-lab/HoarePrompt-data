Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters, as special characters must come in pairs (each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors). Therefore, it prints 'NO' for odd `n`.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function prints 'YES' and constructs a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. This ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, making every character in the string special. The pattern is constructed using a loop that appends 'A' and 'B' alternately to a list, which is then joined into a string.

4. **String Length**: The constructed string for even `n` has a length of `n`, which is within the required limit of 200 characters (since `n` is at most 50).

5. **Output Format**: The function follows the required output format: for each test case, it prints 'NO' if no suitable string exists, or 'YES' followed by the constructed string if a suitable string exists.

Given the above points, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
