### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should have a length of at most 200 characters.
   - If no such string can be constructed, we should print "NO".

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
   - For each test case, we need to print "YES" followed by a valid string if possible, or "NO" if not.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - For a character to be special, it must be part of a pair of the same characters.
   - Each pair of the same characters contributes 2 special characters.
   - Therefore, `n` must be even to have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it prints "YES" and constructs a string of length `n` with a pattern that ensures exactly `n` special characters.
   - The pattern is constructed by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs. For example, for `n = 6`, the pattern is "ABABAB".

5. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times.
   - In each iteration, it appends two characters: one from 'A' and one from 'B'.
   - The characters are chosen such that they alternate, ensuring that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
   - The program ensures that the string length is exactly `n` when `n` is even, which is within the limit of 200 characters.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly determines whether a valid string can be constructed based on the given `n`.
   - It constructs the string in a way that ensures exactly `n` special characters.
   - The string length is always within the limit of 200 characters.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.
