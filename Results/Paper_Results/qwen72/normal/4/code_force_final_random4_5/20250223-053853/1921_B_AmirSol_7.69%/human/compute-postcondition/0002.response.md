The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is already a positive integer and `i` is 0, the condition `i < n` will always be true for the first iteration, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
