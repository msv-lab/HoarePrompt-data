The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not carry any specific state that needs to be adjusted. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
