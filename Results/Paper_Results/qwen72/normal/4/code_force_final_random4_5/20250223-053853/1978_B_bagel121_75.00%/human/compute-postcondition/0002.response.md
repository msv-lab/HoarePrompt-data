Output State: **The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated based on the input provided for each iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. The loop will print a result for each iteration, but the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be reset to the next input values for the next iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the values provided in the last input, and `t` will be 0.**
