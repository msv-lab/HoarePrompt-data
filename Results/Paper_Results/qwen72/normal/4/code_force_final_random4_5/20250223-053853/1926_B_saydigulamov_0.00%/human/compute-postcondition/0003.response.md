The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. The function processes each test case and outputs the shape (either "triangle" or "square") that includes all the '1's in the grid.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of '0's and '1's. It outputs the shape (either "triangle" or "square") that includes all the '1's in the grid for each test case.**
