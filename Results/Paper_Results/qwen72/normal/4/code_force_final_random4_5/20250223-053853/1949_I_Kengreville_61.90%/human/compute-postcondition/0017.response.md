Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`.
- `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `False` (meaning that for all `i`, `c1` is `0` after the DFS).

The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects listed in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
