n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each of the next n lines contains three integers x_i, y_i, and r_i, where -10^9 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they may be tangent to each other.
