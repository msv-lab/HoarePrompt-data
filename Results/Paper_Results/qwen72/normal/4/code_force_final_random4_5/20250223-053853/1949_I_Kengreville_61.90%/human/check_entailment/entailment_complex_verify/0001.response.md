### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It also initializes an empty list `nodes` to keep track of disks in the current connected component.

2. **DFS for Connected Components**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - The `dfs` function is called for each disk that has not been visited yet.
   - During the DFS, the program checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.
   - If disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the connected disks.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, for the starting disk of each connected component.
   - For each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i`, the coefficients are updated as follows:
     - `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`
     - `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`
   - These updates ensure that the sum of the radii changes in a way that maintains tangency.

4. **Sum of Coefficients**:
   - After the DFS for a connected component, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in that component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it means that it is possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.
   - The variable `ok` is used to track if any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `ok` is `True` after processing all connected components, the program prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Tangency Check**: The program correctly checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii. This is done using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, which is mathematically sound for checking tangency.

- **Coefficient Update**:
  - The initial values of `coef0` and `coef1` are set to 0 and 1, respectively, for the starting disk of each connected component.
  - For each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i`, the coefficients are updated as `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`.
  - These updates are designed to ensure that the new radii maintain tangency. Specifically, `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` ensures that the signs of the coefficients alternate, which is a key part of the algorithm to check if the sum of radii can be reduced.

- **Connected Components**: The program correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks using DFS. The `visited` list ensures that each disk is only processed once, and the `nodes` list keeps track of the disks in the current connected component.

- **Sum of Coefficients**:
  - The sum of `coef1` being non-zero is a valid condition to determine if the radii can be changed to strictly decrease the sum. If `c1` (the sum of `coef1` for the current connected component) is non-zero, it indicates that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases.
  - The program correctly uses this condition to set `ok` to `True` if any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The tangency check, coefficient updates, and connected component identification are all handled correctly. The final condition to check if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero is also valid for the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
