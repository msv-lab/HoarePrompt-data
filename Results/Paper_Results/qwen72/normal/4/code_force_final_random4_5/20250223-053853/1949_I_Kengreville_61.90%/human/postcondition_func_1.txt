The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` and modifies the `nodes` list to include the indices of all disks that are directly or indirectly connected to the `i`-th disk, where the sum of their radii equals the distance between their centers. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited. Additionally, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for each connected disk `j` by setting `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain unchanged. If the `i`-th disk is already visited, the function does not modify any lists.
