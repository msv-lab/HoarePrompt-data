You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` and modifies the `nodes` list to include the indices of all disks that are directly or indirectly connected to the `i`-th disk, where the sum of their radii equals the distance between their centers. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited. Additionally, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for each connected disk `j` by setting `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain unchanged. If the `i`-th disk is already visited, the function does not modify any lists.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and initializes arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It also initializes an empty list `nodes` to keep track of disks in the current connected component.

2. **DFS for Connected Components**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - The `dfs` function is called for each disk that has not been visited yet.
   - During the DFS, the program checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.
   - If disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the connected disks.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, for the starting disk of each connected component.
   - For each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i`, the coefficients are updated as follows:
     - `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`
     - `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`
   - These updates ensure that the sum of the radii changes in a way that maintains tangency.

4. **Sum of Coefficients**:
   - After the DFS for a connected component, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in that component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it means that it is possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.
   - The variable `ok` is used to track if any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `ok` is `True` after processing all connected components, the program prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Tangency Check**: The program correctly checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.
- **Coefficient Update**: The coefficient updates ensure that the new radii maintain tangency while potentially reducing the sum of all radii.
- **Connected Components**: The program correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks using DFS.
- **Sum of Coefficients**: The sum of `coef1` being non-zero is a valid condition to determine if the radii can be changed to strictly decrease the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
