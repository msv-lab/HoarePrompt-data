Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`.
- `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `True` because at least one `c1` is not `0` after the DFS for any `i`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The value of `ok` is `True`, but the `print` statement does not depend on the value of `ok` or any other variable. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
