### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and an empty list `nodes`.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - For each disk `i` that has not been visited, it marks `i` as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - It then iterates over all other disks `j` to check if they are tangent to disk `i` by verifying if the sum of their radii squared equals the squared distance between their centers.
   - If disks `i` and `j` are tangent, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for disk `j` and recursively calls `dfs` on `j`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over all disks to find connected components using the `dfs` function.
   - For each connected component, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` values for the disks in that component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` values for any connected component is non-zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ok` is `True` at the end of the main loop, it prints `YES`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii in the desired manner.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of DFS:**
  - The DFS function correctly identifies connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
  - The `coef0` and `coef1` values are updated in a way that reflects the constraints of the problem. Specifically, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, which ensures that the sum of radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency.

- **Sum of Coefficients:**
  - The program checks if the sum of `coef1` values for any connected component is non-zero. This is a key part of the algorithm because if `c1` is non-zero, it means that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no connected components (i.e., all disks are isolated) by correctly setting `ok` to `False`.
  - It also handles the case where all disks are already tangent and cannot be adjusted to decrease the sum of radii.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The use of DFS to find connected components and the calculation of `coef0` and `coef1` values are appropriate for the problem.

**Correctness: True**
