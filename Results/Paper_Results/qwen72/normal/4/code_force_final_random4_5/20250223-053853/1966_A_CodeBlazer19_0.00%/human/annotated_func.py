#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and the second element is a list of integers `[c_1, c_2, ..., c_n]` representing the numbers on the cards (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged. The loop prints `k - 1` for each iteration, but the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not stored or used after the loop. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (number of cards and number of cards exchanged during each operation) and a list of integers `l` (the numbers on the cards). The function then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not stored or used after the loop.
