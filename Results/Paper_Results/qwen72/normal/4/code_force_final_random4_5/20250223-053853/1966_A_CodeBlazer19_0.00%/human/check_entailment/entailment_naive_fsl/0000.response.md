Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which does not consider the actual numbers on the cards or the operations that can be performed. For example, consider the first test case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`, and the cards are `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`. The correct output should be `2` (as shown in the example), but the program will output `2` for any input with `k = 3`, regardless of the actual card numbers and their counts. This is clearly incorrect.
