The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (number of cards and number of cards exchanged during each operation) and a list of integers `l` (the numbers on the cards). The function then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not stored or used after the loop.
