The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and the second element is a list `[c_1, c_2, ..., c_n]` representing the numbers on the cards (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the maximum number of cards that can be made to have the same number after performing the card exchange operation any number of times.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, k)` and a list `[c_1, c_2, ..., c_n]` of integers, where `n` is the number of cards, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and each `c_i` is an integer representing the number on a card, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).
