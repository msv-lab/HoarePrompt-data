### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - The function is correct and behaves as expected for the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the user input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '1', and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - If all characters are the same, it prints 'NO' because no valid partition can be made.
     - If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
       - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`, which is a valid partition.
       - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
         - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' because no valid partition can be made.
         - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`, which is a valid partition.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Case 1: `s` is not a palindrome**:
  - The function correctly prints 'YES', '1', and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
- **Case 2: `s` is a palindrome and all characters are the same**:
  - The function correctly prints 'NO' because no valid partition can be made.
- **Case 3: `s` is a palindrome and a different character is found**:
  - The function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
    - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints a valid partition.
    - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints 'NO' because no valid partition can be made.
    - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints a valid partition.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single character string**:
  - If `s` is a single character, `func_1(s)` will return `True` because a single character is a palindrome.
  - The function will search for a different character, but since there is only one character, `x` will remain `-1`.
  - The function will correctly print 'NO'.
- **String with all characters the same**:
  - If `s` consists of the same character repeated, `func_1(s)` will return `True`.
  - The function will search for a different character, but since all characters are the same, `x` will remain `-1`.
  - The function will correctly print 'NO'.
- **String with a different character in the middle**:
  - If `s` is a palindrome but has a different character in the middle, the function will find this character and check the substrings.
  - If the substrings can be partitioned into non-palindromic parts, it will print a valid partition.
  - If not, it will print 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and edge conditions described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
