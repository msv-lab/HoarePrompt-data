Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `s[:x + 1]` is the substring of `s` from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `x`.
   - `s[x + 1:]` is the substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after the one at index `x` to the end of the string.
   - The `print` statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

4. **Explanation:**
   - Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, `s[:x + 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to and including the first different character.
   - `s[x + 1:]` will include the rest of the string starting from the character immediately after the first different character.

5. **Output:**
   - The first part of the output, `s[:x + 1]`, will be the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
   - The second part of the output, `s[x + 1:]`, will be the remaining part of the string after the first different character.

Output: **[s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the remaining part of the string after the first different character)**
