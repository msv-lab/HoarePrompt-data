Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
- The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a constant string value.

Output: **YES**
