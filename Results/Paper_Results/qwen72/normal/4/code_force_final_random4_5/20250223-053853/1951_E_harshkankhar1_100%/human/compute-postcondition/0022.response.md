Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
- The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`).
- Additionally, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The conditions provided ensure that `x` is a valid index in the string `s` and that the substring `s[x + 1:]` meets the criteria defined by `func_1`.
- Since the conditions are met, the program will execute the `print('YES')` statement, which prints the string 'YES' to the console.
