### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "1", and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints "NO" because there is no way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
       - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`, which is a valid partition.
       - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
         - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
         - Otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`, which is a valid partition.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` is a single character, `func_1(s)` will return `True` (since a single character is a palindrome), and the function will correctly print "NO".
   - If the string `s` has all the same characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), `func_1(s)` will return `True`, and the function will correctly print "NO".
   - If the string `s` has a different character at the second position (e.g., "abaaa"), the function will correctly identify `x` as 1 and check if `s[2:]` is a palindrome. If it is not, it will print the valid partition. If it is, it will print "NO".
   - If the string `s` has a different character at the middle position (e.g., "aaabaaa"), the function will correctly identify `x` as `n // 2` and print "NO" if `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
   - For other cases, the function will correctly identify the first different character and partition the string accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that the string is partitioned into non-palindromic substrings when possible and prints "NO" when it is not possible.

Correctness: **True**
