You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and its length n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the string input by the user with a length between 1 and 10^6)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: If `s` is a string where all characters are the same as `s[0]`, then `x` remains -1. If `s` contains a character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (1 ≤ i < n), then `x` is the index of the first occurrence of this different character.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: - The first part of the output, `s[:x + 1]`, will be the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
        #   - The second part of the output, `s[x + 1:]`, will be the remaining part of the string after the first different character.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where `s[:x + 2]` is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and `s[x + 2:]` is the substring from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of `s`)
        #State: *`s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1. The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`). If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, then the function behaves accordingly to the if part. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, then the function behaves accordingly to the else part.
    #State: *`s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1`. If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`), the function behaves accordingly to the if part. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, the function behaves accordingly to the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
