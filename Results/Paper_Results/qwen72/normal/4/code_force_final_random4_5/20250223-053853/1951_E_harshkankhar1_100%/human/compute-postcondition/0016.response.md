The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The initial state provides information about the string `s` and the index `x`, but these details do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant integer `2`, the output will always be `2` regardless of the values of `s` and `x`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **2**
