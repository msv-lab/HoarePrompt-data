You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), or False if it is not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`). If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, then the function behaves accordingly to the if part. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, then the function behaves accordingly to the else part.
    #State: *`s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1`. If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`), the function behaves accordingly to the if part. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, the function behaves accordingly to the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the user input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and has a length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. It then checks if the string `s` satisfies a condition defined by `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` is `False`, the function prints 'YES', '1', and the string `s`, and then returns. If `func_1(s)` is `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character. If all characters are the same, it prints 'NO' and returns. If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. In all cases, the function returns nothing.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition the string in cases where the string contains repeated characters but is not a palindrome overall. For example, consider the string `abba`. The program will incorrectly output `NO` for this string, even though a valid partition exists (e.g., `ab`, `ba`).

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- The program checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome. If it is not, it prints `YES` and the entire string as the partition.
- If the string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character. If it finds such a character, it attempts to partition the string.
- However, the logic for partitioning the string is flawed. It only checks if the substring from the first different character to the end is a palindrome. If it is not, it prints the partition. If it is, it prints `NO` without considering other possible partitions.

For the string `abba`:
- The entire string is a palindrome, so it enters the loop to find a different character.
- It finds the second character `b` and sets `x = 1`.
- It then checks if `s[2:]` (i.e., `ba`) is a palindrome. Since it is not, it prints `YES` and the partition `ab ba`.
- However, this partition is incorrect because `ab` and `ba` are both palindromes.

To fix this, the program should consider all possible partitions and ensure that none of the substrings are palindromes.
