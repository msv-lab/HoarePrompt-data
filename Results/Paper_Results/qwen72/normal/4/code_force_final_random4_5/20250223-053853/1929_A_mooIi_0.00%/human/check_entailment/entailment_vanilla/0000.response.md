Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element to the last.
   - The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize this sum.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order.
   - When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, but the sum of these differences will be maximized because the largest elements will be paired with the smallest elements, creating the largest possible positive differences.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array elements.
   - However, instead of calculating the beauty of the sorted array, it prints the sorted array elements as a space-separated string.

4. **Output Comparison**:
   - The program's output is the sorted array elements, which is not the required output.
   - The required output is the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The program simply sorts the array and prints it, which is not the expected behavior.

Correctness: **False**
