Reasoning:  
The given program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints it as a space-separated string. This does not compute or output the maximum beauty of the array.

For example, for the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The program will output:
```
1 2 3
```
But the correct output should be the maximum beauty, which is `2` (as explained in the problem statement).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
