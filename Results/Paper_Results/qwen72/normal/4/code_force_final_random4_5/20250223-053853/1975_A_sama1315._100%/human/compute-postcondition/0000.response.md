The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to be the `read` method of `sys.stdin`. This change affects how input is read from the standard input, but it does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.**
