### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Input**: `a` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, where `2 <= n <= 50`.
   - **Output**: 'Yes' if the array can be sorted by the operation, 'No' otherwise.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then creates a concatenated version of the array `a + a` and checks all possible subarrays of length `n` within this concatenated array.
     - If any subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic of checking all cyclic permutations of the array by using `a + a` and slicing it is correct.
     - The function correctly identifies if the array can be sorted by the operation.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Output**: It prints the results for each test case.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It initializes `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_1` with `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input.
     - It handles multiple test cases as specified.
     - The results are printed in the correct format.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - **State Before `func_1` Call**:
     - `a` is a list of positive integers with length `n` (2 <= n <= 50).
   - **State After `func_1` Call**:
     - If a segment in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, `func_1` returns 'Yes'.
     - If no such segment is found, `func_1` returns 'No'.
   - **State Before `func_2` Call**:
     - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
     - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
     - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
   - **State After `func_2` Call**:
     - `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `data`.
     - The results are printed in the correct format.

5. **Edge Cases and Potential Issues**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array cannot be sorted by any number of operations.
   - The input reading and processing in `func_2` are efficient and handle the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation and handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
