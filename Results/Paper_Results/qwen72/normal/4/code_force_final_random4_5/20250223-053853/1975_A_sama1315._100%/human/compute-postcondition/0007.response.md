Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n]` (the last `n` processed in the loop), `a` is a list of the last `n` integers processed in the loop, `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `idx` is `1 + t * (n + 1)` (the index after the last processed element in `data`), `results` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding list of integers `a` in each iteration.
