### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The operation can be represented as: if `a = x + y`, we can set `a := y + x`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - The function `func_1(a)` checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by performing the split and swap operation.
   - It sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It creates a concatenated array `concatenated_a` by appending `a` to itself (`a + a`).
   - It iterates through the concatenated array and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to check if the array can be sorted and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness of `func_1(a)`**
   - The logic in `func_1(a)` is correct because:
     - By concatenating `a` with itself, we are effectively considering all possible splits of the array.
     - If any subarray of length `n` in the concatenated array matches the sorted version of `a`, it means that by performing the split and swap operation, we can make `a` non-decreasing.
     - This approach ensures that we check all possible ways to split and swap the array.

5. **Correctness of `func_2()`**
   - The logic in `func_2()` is correct because:
     - It correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and collects the results.
     - It prints the results in the required format.

6. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` accurately describes its behavior:
     - It reads the input from `sys.stdin`.
     - It processes multiple test cases.
     - It calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
     - It collects the results and prints them.
   - The state of the program after the function concludes is as described in the summary.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions are correctly implemented to solve the given problem. The approach in `func_1(a)` is valid and efficient for the given constraints, and `func_2()` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
