### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input**: An array `a` of positive integers.
   - **Output**: 'Yes' if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation, otherwise 'No'.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then creates a concatenated version of the array `a + a` to handle cyclic permutations.
     - It iterates through all possible subarrays of length `n` (the length of the original array) within the concatenated array.
     - If any subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns 'No'.

   **Correctness**:
   - The logic of checking all cyclic permutations by using the concatenated array `a + a` is sound. This approach ensures that we can check if any rotation of the array can match the sorted version.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted by returning 'Yes' immediately if `a` is equal to `sorted_a`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input**: Standard input containing multiple test cases.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints each result on a new line.

   **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes it to extract the number of test cases and the arrays.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - The results are printed in the correct format, one result per line.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation.
- The function `func_1` is correctly designed to check all cyclic permutations of the array.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation and handles the input and output as required.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
