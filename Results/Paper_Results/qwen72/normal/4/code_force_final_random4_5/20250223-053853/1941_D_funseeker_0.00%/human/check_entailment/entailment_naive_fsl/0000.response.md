Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the player number is 1 and the direction is counterclockwise. Specifically, when the ball is thrown counterclockwise from player 1, the player number should wrap around to the highest player number (n), but the program incorrectly sets the player number to 0, which is then discarded and replaced with n. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 1 1
2 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
1
4
```
However, the program outputs:
```
1
5
```
This is because the program incorrectly computes `(1 - 2) % 5` as `0`, and then it discards `0` and adds `5` to the set, which is incorrect. The correct computation should be `(1 - 2 + 5) % 5` to handle the wrap-around correctly.
