Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`.
- `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration.
- If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is removed from the set and `n` is added to the set. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the values in `ans`**:
   - `ans` is a set that contains all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for `k` ranging from `0` to `m`.
   - The values of `r` and `c` are returned by `func_1()` in each iteration, but `c` is not used in the computation of `ans`.

2. **Check for the presence of `0` in `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, the set remains unchanged.

3. **Calculate the length of `ans`**:
   - The length of `ans` is the number of unique elements in the set after the potential removal and addition of elements.

### Output Determination:
- The output will be the length of the set `ans` after the described operations.
- The exact length of `ans` depends on the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and the values of `r` returned by `func_1()`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the operations performed.

Output: **len(ans) (where `ans` is the set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for `k` from `0` to `m`, with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` is present)**
