### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input, which are the scores of the three players.

2. **Score Validity Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the total points must be distributed such that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is minimized, and the remaining points are distributed as draws.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the points that can be accounted for by wins and losses.
- The remaining points are then divided by 2 to get the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

### Example Verification:
- **Input: 0 0 0**
  - Sum: 0 (even)
  - Result: \(\frac{0 - 0}{2} = 0\)
  - Output: 0 (Correct)

- **Input: 0 1 1**
  - Sum: 2 (even)
  - Result: \(\frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\)
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Input: 1 1 1**
  - Sum: 3 (odd)
  - Output: -1 (Correct)

- **Input: 1 1 2**
  - Sum: 4 (even)
  - Result: \(\frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2\)
  - Output: 2 (Correct)

- **Input: 3 3 3**
  - Sum: 9 (odd)
  - Output: -1 (Correct)

- **Input: 3 4 5**
  - Sum: 12 (even)
  - Result: \(\frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6\)
  - Output: 6 (Correct)

- **Input: 1 1 10**
  - Sum: 12 (even)
  - Result: \(\frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2\)
  - Output: 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for the validity of the scores, and calculates the maximum number of draws using a valid formula. The output matches the expected results for the given examples.
