### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` from the input, representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum number of draws can be calculated by subtracting the minimum number of wins required to achieve the highest score from the total points and then dividing by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the minimum number of wins required to achieve the highest score is subtracted from the total points. This is necessary because the highest score must be achievable by the sum of the other two scores plus the number of wins.
- The division by 2 is correct because each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Sum is 0 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 0.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Sum is 2 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 1.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Sum is 3 (odd), so the output is -1.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Sum is 4 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Sum is 9 (odd), so the output is -1.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 6.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the input, checks for the odd sum condition, and calculates the maximum number of draws using the appropriate formula. The logic and the formula are consistent with the problem description and the provided examples.
