Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 2 points being added in case of a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program then calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{\text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]})}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that:
   - The total number of points is divided by 2 to account for the points from draws.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is necessary because if `v[2]` is too high, it means there are more points than can be explained by the games played.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **No Games Played**: If all scores are 0, the program correctly prints `0` because no draws can occur.
   - **Single Draw**: If the scores are such that one draw could have occurred (e.g., `0 1 1`), the program correctly prints `1`.
   - **Inconsistent Scores**: If the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 1`), the program correctly prints `-1` because the total score is odd.
   - **Multiple Draws**: For cases where multiple draws could have occurred (e.g., `1 1 2`), the program correctly prints `2`.

4. **General Validity**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the scores are valid and the maximum number of draws can be calculated.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the scores are invalid and prints `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
