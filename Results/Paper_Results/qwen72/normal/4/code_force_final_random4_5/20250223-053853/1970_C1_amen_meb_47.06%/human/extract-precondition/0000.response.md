Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the function should be called with specific input data that includes the number of nodes `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), the number of rounds `t` (t=1), the edges of the tree, and the starting node `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is represented as an array-like structure with exactly two leaves.**
