For the given `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always true, meaning the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state variables (like `i < n` or `students >= 1`), no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **The function `func_1` has not been called, and the variable `numbers` is an empty list. The initial state variables `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and `u_1` remain unchanged.**
