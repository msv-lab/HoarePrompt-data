Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities`, a list of integers in strictly ascending order, and `n`, an integer representing the number of cities in the list. It returns a new list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, depending on which is smaller: the distance to the next city or the distance to the previous city. The original list `cities` remains unchanged. **
