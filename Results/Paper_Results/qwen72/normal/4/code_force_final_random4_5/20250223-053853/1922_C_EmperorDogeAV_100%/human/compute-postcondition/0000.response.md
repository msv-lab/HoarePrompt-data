Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] ≤ 10^9. `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.** 

The initial state of `cities` remains unchanged. The new variable `prog_cities` is created and initialized as a list of `n-1` zeros.
