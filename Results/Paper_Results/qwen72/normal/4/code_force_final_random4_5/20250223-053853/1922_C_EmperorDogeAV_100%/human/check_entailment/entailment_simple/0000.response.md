### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then processes the cities to determine the closest city for each city in both forward and backward directions.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the next city.
   - The function returns `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program creates two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, for the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - These arrays are used to efficiently compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the source city `a` and the destination city `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to travel from `a` to `b` using the prefix sum arrays.
   - If `a < b`, it uses `pref_sum_f` to compute the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses `pref_sum_b` to compute the cost.

### Issues:
- **Backward Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` is called twice: once for the original list of cities and once for the reversed list.
  - However, the logic in `func_1` is not symmetric. It always considers the next city as `cities[i + 1]` and the previous city as `cities[i - 1]`.
  - When the list is reversed, the indices should be adjusted to correctly compute the closest city in the backward direction. Specifically, `forward` should be `cities[i - 1]` and `back` should be `cities[i + 1]` in the reversed list.

- **Indexing Error:**
  - The program uses `i < n - 1` to check if the next city exists, but it should use `i < n - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices in the reversed list.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation in the query processing part is incorrect. The prefix sum arrays should be used to compute the total cost of traveling from one city to another, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the 1-coin travel to the closest city.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly handle the backward direction and the cost calculation for queries.

### Correctness: **False**
