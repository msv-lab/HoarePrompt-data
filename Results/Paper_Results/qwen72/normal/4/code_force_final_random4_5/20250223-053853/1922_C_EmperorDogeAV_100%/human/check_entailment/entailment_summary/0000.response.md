Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to travel between cities, where the cost can be either the direct distance between two cities or 1 coin if traveling to the closest city. The program uses a prefix sum approach to precompute the minimum costs for forward and backward travel and then uses these precomputed values to answer the queries efficiently.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It sets `back` to a very large negative number and `forward` to a very large positive number, which is unnecessary because the cities are already sorted. Moreover, the condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)` is incorrect because it should only consider the closest city, which is always the next or previous city in the sorted list.
   - The correct logic should be to always set the cost to 1 for traveling to the closest city, as the problem guarantees that the closest city is unique.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are intended to store the cumulative costs of traveling to the closest city. However, the way these are calculated and used in the program is incorrect. The prefix sums should store the cumulative minimum costs of traveling from the first city to the current city and from the last city to the current city, respectively.
   - The program currently adds the costs from `func_1` to the prefix sums, but `func_1` returns incorrect values, leading to incorrect prefix sums.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling part of the program is also incorrect. It simply subtracts the prefix sums to get the answer, which does not account for the possibility of traveling to the closest city for 1 coin.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
