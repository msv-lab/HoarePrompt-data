### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, but the problem description suggests that it should take `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing `n` and `k` for each test case) as parameters. However, the function reads input from the user, which is a valid way to handle input in a standalone program. This discrepancy is noted but does not necessarily make the function incorrect if it is meant to be run as a standalone script.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function calculates the frequency of each unique card number using a list comprehension: `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`. This is correct and efficient for the given constraints.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - If the maximum frequency of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, the function prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

5. **Correctness of Output**:
   - The logic for printing `k - 1` when the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to `k` is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards left after performing the operation any number of times. Simply printing `k - 1` does not account for the possibility of further operations.
   - The correct approach should involve repeatedly performing the operation until no more operations can be performed. This can be done by simulating the process or using a more mathematical approach to determine the minimum number of cards left.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the operation any number of times. It only checks if the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` or `n` accordingly, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
