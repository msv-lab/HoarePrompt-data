The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, as it represents the number of test cases `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be incremented from 0 to `t-1` as the loop runs. The initial state of `_` is not relevant, but the value of `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable**
