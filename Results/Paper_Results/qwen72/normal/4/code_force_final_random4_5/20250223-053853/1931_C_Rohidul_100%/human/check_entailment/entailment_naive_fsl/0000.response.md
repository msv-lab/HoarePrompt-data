Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple different elements, and the optimal solution involves selecting a value that is not the first or last element of the array. For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The optimal solution would be to set the middle three elements to 2, which would cost 3 burles. However, the program only considers the lengths of the longest contiguous segments of the first and last elements, and it would output 1, which is incorrect.
