Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are not met, but it incorrectly prints "NONE" for the second condition without checking if the first condition has already been satisfied. For example, if the input is `1 2 1`, the program will print "PEAK" and "NONE" for the same test case, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to use `elif` for the second condition to ensure that only one output is printed per test case.
