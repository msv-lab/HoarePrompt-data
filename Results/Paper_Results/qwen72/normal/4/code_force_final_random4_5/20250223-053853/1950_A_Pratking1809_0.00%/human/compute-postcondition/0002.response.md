The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment with each iteration.

The initial state provided mentions that the function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the loop head uses `q` instead of `t`. To align with the loop head, we need to ensure that `q` is within the specified range for `t`.

State: **`q` must be an integer such that 1 <= q <= 1000, `i` is 0**
