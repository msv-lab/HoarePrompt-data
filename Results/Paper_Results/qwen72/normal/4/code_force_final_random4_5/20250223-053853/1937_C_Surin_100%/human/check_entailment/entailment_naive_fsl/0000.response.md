Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly follow the problem description and constraints for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program initializes the necessary lambda functions for reading input and processes multiple test cases as specified.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value**:
   - The first loop iterates through the indices to find the index `v1` that maximizes the value of `p_v1 | p_v1`. This is done by comparing `p_v1 | p_v1` with `p_i | p_i` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The comparison is straightforward and ensures that `v1` is the index with the maximum value of `p_i`.

3. **Finding the Second Index**:
   - The second loop iterates through the indices to find the index `prev` that, when combined with `v1`, maximizes the value of `p_v1 ⊕ p_i`. This is done by comparing `p_v1 | p_i` with `p_v1 | p_prev` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - If `p_v1 | p_i` is greater than `p_v1 | p_prev`, `prev` is updated to `i`.
   - If `p_v1 | p_i` is equal to `p_v1 | p_prev`, a further query is made to compare `p_i | p_i` with `p_prev | p_prev` to ensure the correct index is chosen.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - After the loops, the program outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes at most `2n` queries in the first loop and at most `n` queries in the second loop, totaling at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly, as it will find the two indices and output the result without exceeding the query limit.
   - The program also handles the case where the permutation is such that the maximum XOR value is achieved by different pairs of indices.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases and inputs. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
