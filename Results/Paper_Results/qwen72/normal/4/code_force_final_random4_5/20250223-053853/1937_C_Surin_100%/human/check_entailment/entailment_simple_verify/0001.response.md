### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries, each of which compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
   - The program must use these queries to deduce the indices \( i \) and \( j \).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) of the largest value in the permutation \( p \) by comparing \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - This is done using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \), which effectively compares \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \).
   - If \( p_v1 \) is less than \( p_i \), \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - Once \( v1 \) is identified, the program then tries to find another index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is greater than \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

4. **Handling Equal Values:**
   - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is equal to \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), the program makes an additional query to compare \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \).
   - If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After finding the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \), the program outputs \( ! \, prev \, v1 \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \).
   - The second loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \).
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will find the two indices and output the result.
   - For larger \( n \), the program ensures that it finds the maximum XOR by comparing all possible values.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **First Loop:**
  - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \).
  - For each \( i \), it compares \( p_v1 \) with \( p_i \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \).
  - If \( p_v1 \) is less than \( p_i \), \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).
  - This ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the largest value in the permutation \( p \).

- **Second Loop:**
  - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \).
  - For each \( i \), it compares \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) with \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \).
  - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is greater than \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).
  - If \( p_v1 \mid p_i \) is equal to \( p_v1 \mid p_{prev} \), an additional query \( ? \, i \, i \, prev \, prev \) is made to compare \( p_i \) with \( p_{prev} \).
  - If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{prev} \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

- **Final Output:**
  - The program outputs \( ! \, prev \, v1 \) as the answer.
  - This ensures that the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) are such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. The logic and the number of queries are within the constraints of the problem.
