Output State: **The function `I` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The input `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), and the total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 10^4. The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads an integer input.**
