Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It then sorts the list `a` in descending order and calculates the maximum possible value of a modified sum of the elements in `a` based on the values of `k` and `x`. The final value of this modified sum, `ans2`, is printed for each test case. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` is reset for each iteration, and the variables `ans1` and `ans2` are recalculated for each test case. **
