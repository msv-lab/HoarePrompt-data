Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` from input, sorts the list `a` in descending order, and calculates the maximum possible value of `ans2` after applying the specified operations. The final value of `ans2` is printed for each test case. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` is reset for each iteration, and the variables `ans1` and `ans2` are recalculated for each test case.**
