### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the behavior of the program based on the provided function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`
- **Input**: `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers.
- **Output**: 
  - Returns `None` if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`.
  - Otherwise, returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

This function is designed to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals. It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the universals are less than 3, which would make it impossible to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts. If this condition is met, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed by dividing the sum of extroverts and universals by 3 and rounding up.

#### Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`
- **Input**: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, all non-negative integers.
- **Output**: 
  - Returns `-1` if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`.
  - Otherwise, returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.

This function first calls `func_1` to determine if it is possible to accommodate the extroverts and universals. If it is not possible, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents required.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is exactly divisible by 3, but there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. Specifically, it mentions the input `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 1`.

#### Analysis of the Example:
- **Input**: `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 1`
- **Expected Output**: `-1`
- **Actual Output**: `3`

Let's break down the function calls for this input:
1. **Call to `func_1(3, 1)`**:
   - `extroverts = 3` and `universals = 1`
   - `extroverts % 3 = 0` (since 3 is divisible by 3)
   - The condition `extroverts % 3 != 0` is not met, so it does not return `None`.
   - It calculates `ceil((3 + 1) / 3) = ceil(4 / 3) = 2`.
   - Therefore, `func_1(3, 1)` returns `2`.

2. **Call to `func_2(1, 3, 1)`**:
   - `introverts = 1`, `extroverts = 3`, `universals = 1`
   - `func_1(3, 1)` returns `2`.
   - The result is `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - Therefore, `func_2(1, 3, 1)` returns `3`.

### Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is exactly divisible by 3, but there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. In the example `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 1`, the program returns `3`, which is incorrect because it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts' preferences with only one universal available.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
