### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must have a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` ensures that if there are any remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3 != 0`), there must be enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If this condition is not met, the function returns `None`, indicating it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No participants (0, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` because no tents are needed.
     - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0` which is correct.
   - **Case 2: Only introverts (7, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` because no tents are needed for extroverts and universals.
     - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns `7` which is correct.
   - **Case 3: Only extroverts (0, 24, 0)**
     - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `8` because 24 extroverts can be divided into 8 tents of 3 people each.
     - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns `8` which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Only universals (0, 0, 10)**
     - `func_1(0, 10)` returns `4` because 10 universals can be divided into 4 tents (3, 3, 3, 1).
     - `func_2(0, 0, 10)` returns `4` which is correct.
   - **Case 5: Impossible to accommodate (1, 4, 1)**
     - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts need 2 more people to form a complete tent, but only 1 universal is available.
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1` which is correct.

5. **General Cases:**
   - **Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `2` because 2 extroverts and 3 universals can be accommodated in 2 tents (1 extrovert + 2 universals, 1 extrovert + 1 universal).
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `3` which is correct.
   - **Case 2: (1, 4, 2)**
     - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `2` because 4 extroverts and 2 universals can be accommodated in 2 tents (2 extroverts + 1 universal, 2 extroverts + 1 universal).
     - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns `3` which is correct.
   - **Case 3: (1, 1, 1)**
     - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` because 1 extrovert needs 2 more people to form a complete tent, but only 1 universal is available.
     - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns `-1` which is correct.
   - **Case 4: (1, 3, 2)**
     - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `2` because 3 extroverts and 2 universals can be accommodated in 2 tents (3 extroverts, 1 universal + 1 universal).
     - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns `3` which is correct.
   - **Case 5: (19, 7, 18)**
     - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `9` because 7 extroverts and 18 universals can be accommodated in 9 tents (7 extroverts + 14 universals, 4 universals).
     - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns `28` which is correct.
   - **Case 6: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `666666667` because 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can be accommodated in 666666667 tents (1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals).
     - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `1666666667` which is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed for the participants based on their preferences. It handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
