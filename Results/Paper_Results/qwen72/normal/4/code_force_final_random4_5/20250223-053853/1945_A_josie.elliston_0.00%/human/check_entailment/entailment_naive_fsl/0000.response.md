Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is exactly divisible by 3, but there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. For example, consider the input `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 1`. According to the problem description, the extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly two others, but there are only enough universals to fill one spot, making it impossible to fulfill the extroverts' preferences. The program should return `-1` in this case, but it does not. Instead, it returns `3`, which is incorrect.
