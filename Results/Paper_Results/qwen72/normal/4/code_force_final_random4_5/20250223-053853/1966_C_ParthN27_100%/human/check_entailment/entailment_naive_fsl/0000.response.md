Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the sorted set of pile sizes has consecutive differences of 1, which is not the correct approach to determine the winner in this game. The correct approach involves checking the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 2 2
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  Alice
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  Bob
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd. Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with no valid move.
