To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `a` and `b` and the list `edges`.

1. **`edges`**: The loop will execute if `edges` is not empty. The state provided indicates that `edges` is a list of tuples, but it does not specify whether this list is non-empty. For the loop to execute, `edges` must contain at least one tuple.

2. **`a` and `b`**: These variables are assigned values from the tuples in `edges` during each iteration. They do not need to be explicitly adjusted before the loop starts, as they will be assigned values from the first tuple in `edges` when the loop begins.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `edges` is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n and a != b, and `edges` must have at least one tuple, `g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`**
