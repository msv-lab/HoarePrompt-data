To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `not_mid`. The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `clique` remains unchanged.
- `small_element` remains unchanged.
- `big_element` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `not_mid` remains unchanged.
- The elements in the range [left, left + mid - 1] of the `arr` array are assigned values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in increasing order.
- The elements in the range [left, left + mid - 1] of the `cliquess` array are assigned the value `clique`.

For the loop to execute, `not_mid` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`left` and `right` remain unchanged, `clique` remains unchanged, `small_element` remains unchanged, `big_element` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
