### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to vertices such that the graph formed by these assignments can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - An edge is added between vertices \( i \) and \( j \) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to print the assignments, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as \( \text{ceil}(n / k) \).
     - It initializes `arr` and `cliquess` arrays of length \( n \) with zeros.
     - It iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to assign values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
     - It prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - It assigns values to the `arr` array in a specific pattern.
     - It assigns the `clique` number to the `cliquess` array for the specified range.
     - The function ensures that the values assigned to `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, \( n \)].

3. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as \( \text{ceil}(n / k) \), which is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned to a clique, and the number of cliques is minimized.
   - **Value Assignment:**
     - The `make_array` function assigns values to `arr` in a way that ensures all values are distinct and within the range [1, \( n \)].
     - The values are assigned in a pattern that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - **Clique Assignment:**
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly updated to reflect the clique assignments.
     - Each vertex is assigned to exactly one clique, and the cliques are formed such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem description:
     - The first line prints the values assigned to the vertices.
     - The second line prints the number of cliques.
     - The third line prints the clique assignments for each vertex.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
