Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. In such cases, the graph should be a single clique, but the program incorrectly calculates the number of cliques and assigns values to the vertices in a way that does not ensure the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 5`:
- The program should output a single clique, as `k` is large enough to connect all vertices.
- However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of cliques as `ceil(5 / 5) = 1`, but the way it assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that all vertices are in the same clique.

The program should be modified to handle this edge case correctly.
