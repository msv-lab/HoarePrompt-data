### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to each vertex.
   - We need to add edges between vertices \( i \) and \( j \) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as \( \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil \).
     - It initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`.
     - It calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate range and clique index.
     - It prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.
   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - It assigns values to the `arr` array in a specific pattern.
     - It assigns the clique index to the `cliquess` array for the specified range.

3. **Behavior Verification**:
   - **Clique Calculation**:
     - The number of cliques is calculated as \( \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil \), which is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned to a clique and the cliques are as few as possible.
   - **Array Assignment**:
     - The `make_array` function assigns values to the `arr` array in a way that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for vertices within the same clique.
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled with the clique indices.

4. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied by the way `make_array` assigns values. Specifically, the values are assigned in a pattern that ensures the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The output format matches the problem description:
     - The first line prints the `arr` array, which contains the assigned values.
     - The second line prints the number of cliques.
     - The third line prints the `cliquess` array, which contains the clique indices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem. The edge condition is also satisfied by the assignment pattern used in `make_array`.

### Correctness:
**True**
