The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` is derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` is printed, `preOne` is an empty list, `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters in `s1` starting from the end of the string, and `totalOne` is 0.
