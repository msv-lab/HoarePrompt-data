To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the structure of the `ans` list step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `ans` is a list of length `n`.
2. Each element in `ans` is calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.
3. `preOne` is an empty list.
4. `suffZero` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters in `s1` starting from the end of the string.
5. `totalOne` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The list `ans` is of length `n`, where `n` is the length of the string `s1`.
- The elements of `ans` are calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is an empty list, so it does not contribute to the calculation of `ans`.
- `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters starting from the end of the string `s1`.
- `totalOne` is 0, which suggests that it might be used in some calculation, but it is not directly involved in the calculation of `ans` based on the given information.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The exact formula or method for calculating each element of `ans` is not provided, but we know it is based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.
- Without the exact formula, we can only describe the elements of `ans` in terms of their relationship to the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.

### Output:
Since the exact formula for calculating the elements of `ans` is not provided, we can only describe the elements in terms of their relationship to the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.

Output: **[values of ans] (where each value in ans is calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in s1)**

If you provide the exact formula or method for calculating the elements of `ans`, I can give a more precise description of the output.
