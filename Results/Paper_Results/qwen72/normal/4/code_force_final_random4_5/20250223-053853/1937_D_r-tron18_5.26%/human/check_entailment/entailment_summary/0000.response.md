### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for a different starting cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element `times` positions before the last element.
     - It is used to compute the cumulative effect of the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the lists and calculating the time for each cell.

3. **Detailed Function Behavior:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of the indices in `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, which will store the results.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - The loop iterates over the string from the last character to the first.
     - For each character `el`:
       - If `el` is '>', it calculates the time using the positions in `preOne` and `suffZero` and updates `ans`.
       - It then updates `preOne` and `totalOne`.
       - If `el` is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the positions in `preOne` and `suffZero` and updates `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the list `ans`, which contains the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `preOne` and `suffZero` ensures that the cumulative effects of the pinball's movement are accounted for.
   - The logic for calculating the time for each cell is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The use of `func_1` and the main loop in `func_2` ensures that the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters are handled correctly, and the results are computed accurately for each starting cell.

**Correctness: True**
