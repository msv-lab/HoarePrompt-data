### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s1` itself.
   - It then calls `func_2(s1, n)` to compute the results for the current test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
   - The function is used to calculate the cumulative sums of certain indices in the lists `preOne` and `suffZero`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function initializes `pre` with the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s1`.
   - It then computes the cumulative sums of these indices in `preOne`.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element `0` and `ans` with a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - The function iterates over the string `s1` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each character `el` in `s1`:
     - If `el` is '>', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - If `el` is '<', it updates `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters.
   - The results are stored in the list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all characters in the string, the function prints the list `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the cumulative sums and differences, which are essential for determining the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
  - The logic of `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the way it is used in `func_2`.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` correctly handles the initialization of `pre` and `preOne` with the indices of '>' characters.
  - The cumulative sums in `preOne` are correctly computed using `accumulate`.
  - The function iterates over the string from the end to the beginning, which is appropriate because the pinball's movement depends on the characters to its right.
  - For each character, the function correctly updates `suffZero` and `ans` based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.
  - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the calculations for the pinball's movement and the time it takes to leave the grid are consistent with the problem description.
