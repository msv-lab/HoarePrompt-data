### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as arguments.
   - It creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct because Kirill can choose to pay either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for each person, and he will always choose the minimum to minimize his total cost.
   - It then calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is done to efficiently calculate the total cost of bribing people from position `i` to the end of the queue.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to find the minimum cost.
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `k-1`, the program calculates the cost of moving Kirill to position `i` by adding `a[i]` (the cost to bribe the person at position `i`) and `suff[i + 1]` (the cost to bribe all people from position `i+1` to the end). It updates `ans` with the minimum of these costs.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any position within the first `k` positions.
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is used to efficiently compute the total cost of bribing people from any position `i` to the end of the queue.
   - The loop that updates `ans` ensures that the minimum cost is found for all possible positions `i` from `0` to `k-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is equal to `n` (Kirill can be at any position in the queue).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is `1` (Kirill must be at the very front of the queue).

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\) and \(1 \le n \le 200,000\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
