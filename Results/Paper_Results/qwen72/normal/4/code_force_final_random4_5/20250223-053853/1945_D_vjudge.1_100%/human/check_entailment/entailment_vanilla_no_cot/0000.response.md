Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each position `i`. However, this does not correctly represent the cost Kirill would incur if he moves to a position `j < i`. The cost should be `a[j]` plus the sum of `b[k]` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `suff`**:
   - The `suff` array is supposed to store the suffix sum of the `c` array, but this is not the correct way to calculate the total cost Kirill would pay if he moves to a position `j`. The suffix sum does not account for the correct cost structure as described in the problem.

3. **Incorrect Final Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the minimum cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This does not correctly account for the cost of moving to position `i` and then paying the necessary `b[k]` costs for all positions between `i` and the current position.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to use a different approach that accurately calculates the cost of moving to each position `j < i` and then finds the minimum cost to move to one of the first `m` positions. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    # Initialize the total cost array
    total_cost = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate the total cost to move to each position
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        total_cost[i] = total_cost[i + 1] + b[i]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to move to one of the first k positions
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for j in range(k):
        min_cost = min(min_cost, a[j] + total_cost[j + 1])
    
    return min_cost
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the total cost to move to each position and then finds the minimum cost to move to one of the first `k` positions.
