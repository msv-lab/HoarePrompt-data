The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `a_i` and `b_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function computes the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This minimum value is then printed. The function does not return any value.
