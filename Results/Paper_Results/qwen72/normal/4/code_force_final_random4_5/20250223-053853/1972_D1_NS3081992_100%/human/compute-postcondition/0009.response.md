Functionality: ** The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing`, an integer `da` that is a key in `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially `0`, and sets `processing[di - 1]` to `1` temporarily. The function returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by the recursive calls. Additionally, the element at index `da - 1` in the list `rank` is updated to `tmp + 1`. The dictionary `d` and the list `processing` remain unchanged after the function concludes, except for the temporary modifications during the recursive calls. **
