#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer value from the standard input and returns this integer value.

def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers read from a line of input from stdin, where the integers were originally space-separated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from stdin, which is expected to contain space-separated integers, and returns a map object that contains these integers converted to integer type. The function does not take any input parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the map object is ready to be used, for example, by converting it to a list or iterating over it to access the integers.

    #The program returns a list of integers that were input from stdin, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain a sequence of integers separated by spaces. It then converts this sequence into a list of integers and returns this list. The function does not modify any external state or variables and operates solely on the input provided via stdin.

    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a separate input item provided by the user, split based on whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user-provided input is transformed into a list of strings, and this list is available for further use.

The integer `da` remains unchanged. The list `rank` remains unchanged. The variable `tmp` will be the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing`, an integer `da` that is a key in `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns `1` if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially `0`, and sets `processing[di - 1]` to `1` temporarily. The function returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by the recursive calls. Additionally, the element at index `da - 1` in the list `rank` is updated to `tmp + 1`. The dictionary `d` and the list `processing` remain unchanged after the function concludes, except for the temporary modifications during the recursive calls.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.

    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing the value of `y` (which is the second value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`), the value of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` is the first value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)` and `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`), and `g` (which is the third value returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second values from the recursive call, respectively, and `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`), and the third value from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The final state of the program is that the function returns a tuple of three values, which are the results of the recursive calls and the specified arithmetic operations.

    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: a remains the same list of integers, n remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m remains a positive integer, and k is an integer that has been decreased by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. Additionally, k is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` such that `0 <= n <= len(a)`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference `(m - a[i])`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The list `a`, integer `n`, and integer `m` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
