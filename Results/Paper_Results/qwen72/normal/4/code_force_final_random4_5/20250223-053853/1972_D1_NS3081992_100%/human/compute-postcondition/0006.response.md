The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer. The function can return one of two values based on certain conditions:

- Case_1: The function returns 1.
- Case_2: The function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` within the bounds of the list length, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`, and return either 1 or -1 based on specific conditions that are not detailed here.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` within the bounds of the list length, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It returns 1 or -1 based on specific conditions.**
