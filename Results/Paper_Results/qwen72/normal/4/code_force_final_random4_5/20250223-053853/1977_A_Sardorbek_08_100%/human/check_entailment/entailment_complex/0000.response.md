### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **`if b == c`**: If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif b < c`**: If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `c` because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif b % 2 == c % 2`**: If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build a tower of height `c` after `b` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes will remain the same after an even number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **`else`**: If none of the above conditions are met, it means that `b` and `c` have different parities, making it impossible to build a tower of height `c` after `b` moves. This condition is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case as required. The output is case-insensitive, so printing 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' is acceptable.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if `b` is 1 and `c` is 1, the output is 'YES' (one move to add one cube).
   - If `b` is 2 and `c` is 1, the output is 'No' (it's impossible to end up with one cube after two moves).

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function processes `a` test cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The conditions and logic used in the function are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower of height `c` after `b` moves, based on the problem description and the provided conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
