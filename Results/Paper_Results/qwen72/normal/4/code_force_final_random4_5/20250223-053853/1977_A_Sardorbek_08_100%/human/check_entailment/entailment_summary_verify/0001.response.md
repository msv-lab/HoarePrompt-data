### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `b` and `c` from the input.
   - This aligns with the problem description and is handled correctly.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If `b == c`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes. If so, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
     - This is accurate and matches the problem's requirements.
   - **If `b < c`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If so, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes using only `b` moves. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
     - This is accurate and matches the problem's requirements.
   - **If `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - This condition checks if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). This is a key insight because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can alternate between adding and removing cubes to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can also alternate between adding and removing cubes to end up with `c` cubes.
     - The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
     - This is accurate and matches the problem's requirements.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it means that `b` and `c` have different parities, making it impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.
     - This is accurate and matches the problem's requirements.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "YES", "Yes", and "NO", "No" are both acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
