Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `b` and `c` (representing `n` and `m` respectively).

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), the program prints "YES" because Nikita can achieve this by simply adding one cube per move.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), the program prints "Yes". This is because the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even to achieve the desired tower height. For example, if `b` is 5 and `c` is 3, Nikita can add 4 cubes and remove 1 cube to end up with 3 cubes.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program prints "No" because the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes would be odd, which is not possible to achieve by adding or removing one cube at a time.

3. **Output**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

The logic and conditions in the program are consistent with the problem requirements, making the program correct.
