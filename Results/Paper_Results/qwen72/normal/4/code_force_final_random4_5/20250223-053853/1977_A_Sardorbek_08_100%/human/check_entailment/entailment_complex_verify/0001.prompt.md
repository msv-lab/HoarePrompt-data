You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `a` times. For each iteration, the values of `b` and `c` were read from input, and a corresponding 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' was printed based on the conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, `a` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If `b == c`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes. If so, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
   - **If `b < c`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If so, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes using only `b` moves. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **If `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - This condition checks if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). This is a key insight because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can alternate between adding and removing cubes to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can also alternate between adding and removing cubes to end up with `c` cubes.
     - The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it means that `b` and `c` have different parities, making it impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
