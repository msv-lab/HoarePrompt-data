The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might interact with or use some form of input or data structure containing test cases where each test case involves two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a result based on these test cases, but the specific output is not described in the given information.

Since the output is not specified, I can only infer the general structure based on the constraints. If you provide more specific output details, I can refine the description.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates on a set of test cases where each test case involves two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a result based on these test cases, but the specific output is not provided.**
