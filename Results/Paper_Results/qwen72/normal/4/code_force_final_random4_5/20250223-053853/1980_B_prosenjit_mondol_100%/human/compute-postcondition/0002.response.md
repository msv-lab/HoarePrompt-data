The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the input parameters.
