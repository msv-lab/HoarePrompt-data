You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is determined by the conditions within the loop for each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are read from input and processed. The variable `x` is set to the value of `a[f]` before sorting `a` in descending order. The loop then prints 'NO' if `a[k]` is greater than `x`, 'YES' if `a[k]` is less than `x`, and 'MAYBE' if `a[k]` is equal to `x` and either `k` is the last index of `a` or the next element `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`. The initial state of `func` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube. In such a case, the favorite cube could be either removed or not removed, depending on its position among the cubes with the same value. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if the value of the k-th cube is equal to the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube will always be removed, which is not necessarily true.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
Expected output:
```
MAYBE
```
Actual output:
```
YES
```
In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube could be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position, so it may or may not be removed. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" in this case.
