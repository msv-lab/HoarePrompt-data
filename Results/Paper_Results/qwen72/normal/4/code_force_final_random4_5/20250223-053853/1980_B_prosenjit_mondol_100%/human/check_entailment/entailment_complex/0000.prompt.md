Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is determined by the conditions within the loop for each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are read from input and processed. The variable `x` is set to the value of `a[f]` before sorting `a` in descending order. The loop then prints 'NO' if `a[k]` is greater than `x`, 'YES' if `a[k]` is less than `x`, and 'MAYBE' if `a[k]` is equal to `x` and either `k` is the last index of `a` or the next element `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`. The initial state of `func` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, two integers `f` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the `f`-th element (0-indexed) in the list is greater than the `k`-th element (0-indexed) after the list is sorted in descending order. It prints 'NO' if the `k`-th element is greater, 'YES' if the `k`-th element is less, and 'MAYBE' if the `k`-th element is equal to the `f`-th element and either `k` is the last index or the next element is less than the `f`-th element. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state.
