Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube. In such a case, the favorite cube could be either removed or not removed, depending on its position among the cubes with the same value. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if the value of the k-th cube is equal to the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube will always be removed, which is not necessarily true.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
Expected output:
```
MAYBE
```
Actual output:
```
YES
```
In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube could be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position, so it may or may not be removed. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" in this case.
