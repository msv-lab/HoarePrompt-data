Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition `if n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not of the most frequent color is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If neither condition is true, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the answer is `Yes`.

The logic is sound and matches the problem description. The program will correctly determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
