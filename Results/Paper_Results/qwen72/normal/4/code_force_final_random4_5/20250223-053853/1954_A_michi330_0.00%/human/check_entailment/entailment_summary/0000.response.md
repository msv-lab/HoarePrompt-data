### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The key points to consider are:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most common color (i.e., the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color) is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the answer is 'Yes'.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'NO' or 'Yes' for each test case based on the conditions.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
  - This condition is straightforward. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. The answer is 'NO'.
  
- **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
  - This condition is more complex. It calculates the number of parts that are not the most common color. The most common color can appear at most `math.ceil(n / m)` times (since there are `m` colors and `n` parts). If the number of parts that are not this most common color is less than `k`, Bob can repaint all of these parts to the most common color, making all parts the same color. The answer is 'NO'.
  - However, this condition is not entirely correct. The correct condition should be `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` because if the number of parts that are not the most common color is exactly `k`, Bob can still repaint all of them to the most common color.

### Corrected Condition:
- The correct condition should be:
  - `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`

### Correctness:
- The program is almost correct, but it has a minor issue with the second condition. It should use `<=` instead of `<` to correctly handle the case where the number of parts that are not the most common color is exactly `k`.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect due to the minor issue in the second condition.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
