The function `func_1` is described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns the maximum length `k` of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The function handles multiple test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the lengths of `a` and `b` (n and m respectively) are such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.**
