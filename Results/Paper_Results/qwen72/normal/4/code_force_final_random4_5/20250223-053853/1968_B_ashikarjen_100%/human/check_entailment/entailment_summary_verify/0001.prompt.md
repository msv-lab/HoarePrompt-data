You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

    0

Output

    2
    2

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates and prints the maximum length `k` of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` using `input()`.

2. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The program initializes two variables, `k` and `j`, to 0. `k` will store the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to traverse `b`.
   - It iterates over each character in `a` using a `for` loop with the range `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If it finds a match (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` and `j` to move to the next character in both strings.
   - If it does not find a match and `j` reaches the end of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `a` or `b` are empty or where `a` is longer than `b` by breaking out of the loop when `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - It also correctly handles cases where `a` and `b` are the same length and where `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient as it only traverses each character in `b` once for each character in `a`, making it O(n * m) in the worst case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
