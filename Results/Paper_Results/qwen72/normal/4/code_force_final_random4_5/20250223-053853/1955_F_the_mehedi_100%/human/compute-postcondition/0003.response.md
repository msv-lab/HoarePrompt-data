Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer from the user input to determine the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads four integers from the user input, representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It calculates a value `cnt` based on these counts: if all four counts are odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and for each count, `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of the count by 2. The function prints the value of `cnt` for each iteration. After the loop, the variables `a` and `cnt` will retain the values from the last iteration, but these are not returned or used outside the function. The function does not return any value. **
