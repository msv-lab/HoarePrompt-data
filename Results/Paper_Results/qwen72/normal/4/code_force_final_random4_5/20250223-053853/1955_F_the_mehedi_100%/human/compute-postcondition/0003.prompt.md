You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take four integers as input, representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively. These integers are non-negative and do not exceed 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the value of `cnt` for each iteration of the loop, where `cnt` is calculated based on the input list `a` and the condition specified. The variables `a` and `cnt` will be re-initialized in each iteration, and their final values after the loop will be the values from the last iteration. The input list `a` will contain four integers, and `cnt` will be the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, plus 1 if all elements in `a` are odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters, each a non-negative integer not exceeding 200, representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence. The function returns a value based on these counts, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
