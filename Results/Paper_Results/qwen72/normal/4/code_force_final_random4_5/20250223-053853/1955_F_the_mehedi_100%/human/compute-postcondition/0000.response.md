The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The `range` function's argument is determined by `int(input())`, which is the number of times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, the argument to `range` must be a positive integer. 

Given the state before the loop starts, the function `func` is expected to take four integers as input, but this state does not directly affect the loop head. The loop's execution depends on the user input, which must be a positive integer for the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the user input is a positive integer. The variable `_` is not initialized before the loop, but it will be managed by the `range` function during the loop's execution.

State: **The user input must be a positive integer, `_` is managed by the `range` function**
