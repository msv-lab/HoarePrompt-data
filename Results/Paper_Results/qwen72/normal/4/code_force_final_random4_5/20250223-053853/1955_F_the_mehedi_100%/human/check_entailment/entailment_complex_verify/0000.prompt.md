You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take four integers as input, representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively. These integers are non-negative and do not exceed 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the value of `cnt` for each iteration of the loop, where `cnt` is calculated based on the input list `a` and the condition specified. The variables `a` and `cnt` will be re-initialized in each iteration, and their final values after the loop will be the values from the last iteration. The input list `a` will contain four integers, and `cnt` will be the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, plus 1 if all elements in `a` are odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer from the user input to determine the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads four integers from the user input, representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It calculates a value `cnt` based on these counts: if all four counts are odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and for each count, `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of the count by 2. The function prints the value of `cnt` for each iteration. After the loop, the variables `a` and `cnt` will retain the values from the last iteration, but these are not returned or used outside the function. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sequence initially has an even number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, and an odd number of 4s. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero. However, the program incorrectly assumes that the presence of an odd number of 4s will always contribute to Bob's wins, which is not always true.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
The sequence contains only one 4. The bitwise XOR of a single 4 is 4, which is non-zero, so Alice wins. However, the program will output `1`, indicating that Bob wins, which is incorrect.
