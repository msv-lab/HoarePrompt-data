#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, and start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and each value is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to the key node by an edge. The lists are populated based on the `edges` input, and each edge (u, v) is added twice, once in `tree[u]` and once in `tree[v]`. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), a list of tuples `edges` (where each tuple (u, v) satisfies 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v), and an integer `start` (where 1 ≤ start ≤ n). It constructs an undirected tree from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance to either of the first two leaves is even, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
