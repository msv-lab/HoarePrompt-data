The function `func` should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The constraints for `a` and `b` are 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should be called multiple times with different values of `a` and `b`, as specified by the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).

However, the provided function signature is missing the parameters. Assuming the correct function signature is `def func(a, b):`, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of a rectangle, and returns the area of the rectangle.** 

If the function is supposed to handle multiple test cases, the correct function signature might be `def func(t, a, b):`, where `t` is the number of test cases. In this case, the functionality would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It returns the area of the rectangle for each test case.**
