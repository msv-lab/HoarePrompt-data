The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then checks if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly half of the other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and the last values of `a` and `b` will be the dimensions read in the final test case.
