Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even and equal. For example, for the input `2 2`, the program will output `YES`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `NO` because the 2x2 rectangle, when cut into two 1x2 rectangles, can only form a 2x2 rectangle again, which is the same as the original rectangle.

Let's break down the logic:
- The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints `NO` because an odd by odd rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
- The program then checks if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). If either condition is true, it prints `NO`. This is intended to handle cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other, but it incorrectly handles the case where both dimensions are even and equal.
- For all other cases, it prints `YES`.

The issue arises in the second condition. For a 2x2 rectangle, \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b / 2 == a\) are both true, but the correct output should be `NO` because the resulting rectangles (1x2) can only form a 2x2 rectangle again.

To correct this, the program should add a check to handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal.
