Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons when there are leftover cells after placing 2x2 icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `extra_screen` is flawed. The program incorrectly calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
16 1
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output:
```
3
```

In this test case, the program calculates that 1 screen is required for the 2x2 icon, leaving 11 cells available for 1x1 icons. However, the program then incorrectly calculates that an additional 2 screens are needed for the remaining 16 - 11 = 5 1x1 icons, resulting in a total of 3 screens. The correct calculation should show that only 2 screens are needed, as the remaining 5 1x1 icons can fit into the 11 available cells on the first screen.
