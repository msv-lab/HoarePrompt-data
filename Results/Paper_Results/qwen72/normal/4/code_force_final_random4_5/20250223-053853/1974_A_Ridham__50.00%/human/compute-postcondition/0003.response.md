Output State: **The `result` list contains the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop, where the number of screens is calculated based on the values of `x` and `y` provided in the input. The length of the `result` list will be equal to `n`, the number of iterations. The variables `x` and `y` will have the values of the last input provided, and `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` will be calculated based on the last values of `x` and `y`.**
