To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `result`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is an empty list.

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
