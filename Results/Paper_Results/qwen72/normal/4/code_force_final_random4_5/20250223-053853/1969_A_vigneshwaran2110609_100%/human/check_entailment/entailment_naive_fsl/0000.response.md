Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it always prints either 2 or 3, which is not always the correct minimum number of invitations required. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

The program works correctly for the given example, but it fails for other cases. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

However, the program does not correctly handle the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 3 1 5 6 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program prints 3, but the correct answer should be 4. The logic in the program only checks if a friend and their best friend are directly linked and prints 2 if they are, otherwise it prints 3. This does not account for more complex scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required might be greater than 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
