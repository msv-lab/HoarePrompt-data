The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of `x` integers. The function then checks for each element in `l` if the element at the index specified by the current element minus one equals the current index plus one. If this condition is met for any element, the function prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is never met, the function prints `3`. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value. The variable `t` is not used within the function, and the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to `t`.
