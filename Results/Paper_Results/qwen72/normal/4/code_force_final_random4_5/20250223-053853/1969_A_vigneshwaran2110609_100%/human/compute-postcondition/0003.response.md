The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 5000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the size of the list `p`, with the constraint 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but typically, such a function would process these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints. Without more specific information on the output, we can only describe the parameters and the context in which they are used.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 5000); `n`, an integer representing the size of the list `p` (2 <= n <= 50); and `p`, a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and `p_i` ≠ i. The function processes these parameters for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
