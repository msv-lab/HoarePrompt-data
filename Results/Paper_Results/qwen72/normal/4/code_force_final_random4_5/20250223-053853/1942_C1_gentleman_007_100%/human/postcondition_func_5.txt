The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, representing the number of edges (diagonals) to be marked. It returns an adjacency matrix `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1), where `m` pairs of indices (x, y) are set to 1 to indicate marked edges, and all other elements are 0. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`.
