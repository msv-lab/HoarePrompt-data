Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will print the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in each input string `s` during each iteration. If the string `s` is non-increasing (i.e., it does not have any '0' followed by '1'), it will print the number of transitions plus one. The final state of the variables `s` and `count` will be the last input string and the count of transitions in that string, respectively. The variable `flag` will be 1 if the last string had at least one '0' followed by '1', otherwise it will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string. If the string is non-increasing (i.e., it does not have any '0' followed by '1'), it prints the number of transitions plus one. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the number of transitions (or transitions plus one if non-increasing) has been printed for each input string. The variables `s`, `count`, and `flag` will reflect the state of the last processed test case.
