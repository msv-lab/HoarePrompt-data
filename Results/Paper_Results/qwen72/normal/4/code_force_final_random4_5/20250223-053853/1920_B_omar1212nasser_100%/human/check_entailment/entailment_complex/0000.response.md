Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and calls `func_2` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The result from `func_2` is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their turns.
   - It initializes `pos` as an empty list and `s` as the sum of all elements in `elements`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements and appends `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`. This represents the sum after Bob multiplies the smallest `negatives` elements by -1.
   - The function iterates over the number of removals `removals` and updates `s` and `s2` by removing the largest elements from the sum and adjusting the sum of the smallest `negatives` elements.
   - It appends the adjusted sum to `pos` for each possible number of removals.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

3. **Optimality**:
   - Alice's strategy is to remove the largest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob's strategy is to multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` correctly simulates these strategies by considering all possible combinations of removals and negations.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where `removals` or `negatives` are 0.
   - It also handles cases where the number of removals and negations combined is greater than the length of the list.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (1 1 1, [1]), Alice removes the only element, and the sum is 0.
   - For the second test case (4 1 1, [3, 1, 2, 4]), Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in a sum of 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.
   - For the fifth test case (8 5 3, [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9]), Alice removes the two largest elements (9, 9), and Bob multiplies the next three smallest elements (5, 5, 3) by -1, resulting in a sum of -5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = -5.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the game logic and handles the inputs and outputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
