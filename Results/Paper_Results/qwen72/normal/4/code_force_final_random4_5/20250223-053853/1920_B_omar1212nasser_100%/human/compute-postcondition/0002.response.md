Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to the list `pos`. The value of `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`. The expression `sum(elements[-negatives:])` calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`. The result of `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` is then appended to `pos`, which was initially an empty list. The other variables (`removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`) remain unchanged.
