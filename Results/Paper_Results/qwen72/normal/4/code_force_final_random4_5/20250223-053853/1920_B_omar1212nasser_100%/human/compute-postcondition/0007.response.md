The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The constraints are that `0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements)`.

The function returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos` of `removals + 1` elements, where the last element of `pos` is `s - 2 * s2`. Here, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers.**
