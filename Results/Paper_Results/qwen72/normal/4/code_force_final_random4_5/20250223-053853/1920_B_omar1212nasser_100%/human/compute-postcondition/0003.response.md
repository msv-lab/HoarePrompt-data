Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])` calculates the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` and assigns this sum to the variable `s2`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.
