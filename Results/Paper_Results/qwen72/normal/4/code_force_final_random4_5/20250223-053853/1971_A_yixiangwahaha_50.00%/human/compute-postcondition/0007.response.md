The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It does not explicitly accept parameters, but it is expected to process a number of test cases `t`, where `1 <= t <= 100`, and for each test case, it processes two integers `x` and `y` such that `0 <= x, y <= 9`. The function returns the results of these test cases, which are not specified in the given output description.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 9, and returns the results of these test cases. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.**
