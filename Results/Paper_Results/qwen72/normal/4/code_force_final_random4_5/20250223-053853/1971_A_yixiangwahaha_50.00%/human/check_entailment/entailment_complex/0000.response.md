Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( x \) and \( y \). The number of test cases \( t \) is read from the input, but the program incorrectly processes exactly 10 test cases regardless of the value of \( t \). This means the program does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by \( t \).

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where \( t \) is less than 10, which would result in an error because it would try to read more inputs than provided. For example, if \( t = 5 \), the program would still try to read 10 inputs, leading to an `EOFError` when it tries to read beyond the provided inputs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by \( t \).

Correctness: **False**
