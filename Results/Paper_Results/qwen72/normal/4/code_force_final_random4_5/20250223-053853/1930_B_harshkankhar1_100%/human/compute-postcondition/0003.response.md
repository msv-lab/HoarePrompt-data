The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint provided indicates that there should be a context where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. Since the function does not take any parameters, the output must be determined without any input. Without additional context or information about the function's output, it's not possible to describe the functionality accurately. Assuming the function is intended to operate with `n` in some way, we would need more details about what the function returns based on `n`.

Given the constraints and the lack of input parameters, I will assume that the function might return a fixed value or perform a calculation based on a predefined `n` within the function. However, with the information provided, the most precise description I can give is:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on a predefined integer `n` such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The specific output is not defined with the given information.**
