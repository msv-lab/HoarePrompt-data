You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `k` from input. After the loop, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations completed. The variables `n` and `k` are reset to their initial values for each iteration, and `L` is reset to an empty list for each iteration. The variable `tot` is reset to 0 for each iteration, and `pow` is reset to 1 for each iteration. The loop prints a value for each test case based on the conditions provided, but the final state of `t` is the only variable that is consistently affected by the loop, reducing it by the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
