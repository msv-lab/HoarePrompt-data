Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and the elements in `arr` are distinct and range from 1 to `n`.** 

The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to the list of integers returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were updated by `func_1()`. The new `arr` is still a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, with distinct elements ranging from 1 to `n`.
