Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and the elements in `arr` are distinct and range from 1 to `n`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are now the specific values returned by `func_1()`. The list `arr` remains a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, with all elements being distinct.
