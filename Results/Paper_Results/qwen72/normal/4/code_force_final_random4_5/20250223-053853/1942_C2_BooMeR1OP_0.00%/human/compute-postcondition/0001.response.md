Output State: **`a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers based on the input provided.** 

The initial state mentioned that `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers based on the input provided, and the code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. Therefore, `a` is now a list of integers, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain as integers based on the input provided.
