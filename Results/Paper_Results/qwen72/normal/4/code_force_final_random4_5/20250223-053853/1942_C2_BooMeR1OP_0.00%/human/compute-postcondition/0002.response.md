Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is decreased by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers based on the input provided.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = [(num - 1) for num in a]` updates the list `a` by subtracting 1 from each of its elements. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.
