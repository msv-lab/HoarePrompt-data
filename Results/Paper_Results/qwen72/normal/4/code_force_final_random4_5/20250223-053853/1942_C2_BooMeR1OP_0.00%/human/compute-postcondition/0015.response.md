The function `func_1` should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `chosen_vertices`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

The function returns a list of integers representing the vertices you can choose, ensuring that the total number of chosen vertices (including Bessie's choices) does not exceed `y`.
