### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. However, the function currently does not accept any parameters and reads input directly from `input()`.
   - This is a critical issue because the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, and the input for each test case should be passed as arguments to the function.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial calculation of `ans = x - 2` is correct. This is because the minimum number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices is `x - 2`.

3. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The function correctly identifies gaps between consecutive vertices in the sorted list `a` and stores them in the `gaps` list.
   - The gaps are calculated correctly, considering the circular nature of the polygon by adding `n` to the next element if it is the last element in the list.

4. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - The function then sorts the gaps and tries to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices in the gaps.
   - The logic to add vertices in gaps is correct: for each gap, the number of pairs of vertices that can be added is `gap // 2`. If `y` (the number of additional vertices you can choose) is greater than or equal to the number of pairs, the function adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, the function adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `ans`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be given out.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The function `func_1` should be defined to accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` to handle multiple test cases properly.
- The current implementation reads input directly within the function, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases in a loop as described in the problem statement.
- To fix this, the function should be defined as `def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` and the input should be read and passed to the function in the main loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        chosen_vertices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices)

def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    a = [(num - 1) for num in chosen_vertices]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
    
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
    
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program properly defines the function `func_1` to accept the required parameters and handles multiple test cases correctly.
