You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 100, `i` is `a-1`, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. For each iteration, if `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` remains equal to `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`). If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` also maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `b` and `c` have different parities, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q`, where `a` is the number of test cases, `i` is `a-1`, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last test case. The variables `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationships (equal, less than, or greater than) and parities throughout the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` from the input. These represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube per move. The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build the tower. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and this condition ensures that the final number of cubes can be achieved. The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have different parities, it is impossible to build the tower. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement. The case of the letters does not matter, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
