Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 100, `i` is `a-1`, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. For each iteration, if `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` remains equal to `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`). If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` also maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain integers within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `a` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100, indicating the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute.
- The loop counter `i` is now `a-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `b` and `c` are the input integers from the last iteration, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last iteration.
- The conditions checked within the loop (whether `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` and `c` have the same or different parities) have been evaluated for each iteration, and the relationships between `b` and `c` have been maintained as they were initially.
