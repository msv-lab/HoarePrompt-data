Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`, `b` is not equal to `c`, and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). Additionally, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.**
