You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `b` and `c` have different parities, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q`, where `a` is the number of test cases, `i` is `a-1`, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last test case. The variables `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationships (equal, less than, or greater than) and parities throughout the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is less than `m`, it should always output "No" because Nikita cannot make more moves than the number of cubes he wants to end up with. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. For example, if the input is `2 3`, the program will output "Yes" instead of "No". 

Additionally, the program has a minor issue with the output format. The problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive), but the program outputs "YES" and "No" with inconsistent capitalization. This should be standardized to either all uppercase or all lowercase to match the problem description. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('No')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
This version correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m` and ensures consistent output formatting.
