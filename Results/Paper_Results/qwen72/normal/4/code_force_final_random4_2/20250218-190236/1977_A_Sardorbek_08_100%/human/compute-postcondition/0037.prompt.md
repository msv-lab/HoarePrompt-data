Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif b % 2 == c % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` is not equal to `c`, then `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c` with the same or different parities.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` and `c` are input integers, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`). If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` remains equal to `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`). If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` also maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
