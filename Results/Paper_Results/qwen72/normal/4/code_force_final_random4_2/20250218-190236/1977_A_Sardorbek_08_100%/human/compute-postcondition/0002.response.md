Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers.**

The code snippet `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `b` and `c` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is still 0. The new variables `b` and `c` are now integers based on the user input.
