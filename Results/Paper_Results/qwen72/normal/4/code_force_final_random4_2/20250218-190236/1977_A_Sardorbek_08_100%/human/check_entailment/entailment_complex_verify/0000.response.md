### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `b` and `c`.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, the program correctly prints "YES". This is accurate because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve exactly `c` cubes.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, the program correctly prints "NO". This is accurate because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints "Yes". This is accurate because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even for Nikita to achieve exactly `c` cubes. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes will only match the parity of the number of moves if the difference is even.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
     - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program prints "No". This is accurate because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even, and if they have different parities, this condition cannot be met.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs "YES" and "No" with inconsistent capitalization. However, the problem description states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). Therefore, this is not a correctness issue, but a minor stylistic one.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly. For example, if `b` is 1 and `c` is 1, it prints "YES". If `b` is 1 and `c` is 2, it prints "NO". If `b` is 4 and `c` is 2, it prints "Yes". If `b` is 5 and `c` is 2, it prints "No".

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. However, the program does handle this case correctly by printing "NO" when `b < c`.
- The original assessment also mentions a minor issue with output formatting, which is not a correctness issue but a stylistic one.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct in terms of its logic and handling of all cases as per the problem description. The only minor issue is the inconsistent capitalization of the output, which does not affect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
