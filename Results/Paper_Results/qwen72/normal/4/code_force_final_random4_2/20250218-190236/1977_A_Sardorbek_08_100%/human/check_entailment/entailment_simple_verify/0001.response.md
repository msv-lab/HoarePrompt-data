### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, the program correctly prints "YES". This is because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, the program correctly prints "NO". This is because it is impossible to add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), the program correctly prints "Yes". This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and this condition ensures that the final number of cubes can be achieved.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have different parities, the program correctly prints "No". This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, and this condition ensures that the final number of cubes cannot be achieved.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement. The case of the letters does not matter, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and relationships between `b` and `c` throughout the execution.
- The conditions and their corresponding outputs are logically sound and align with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
