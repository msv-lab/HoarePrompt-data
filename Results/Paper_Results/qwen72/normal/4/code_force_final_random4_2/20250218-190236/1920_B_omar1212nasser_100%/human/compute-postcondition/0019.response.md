Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `removals` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `i + 2`.
- The condition that `removals` must be greater than `i + 2` remains valid.
- The value of `s` remains `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`.
- The value of `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`.
