### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the least beneficial to the sum) and Bob to multiply the smallest elements by -1 (which are the most beneficial to minimizing the sum).

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `s` of the array is calculated.
   - The sum `s2` of the last `x` elements (the smallest elements) is also calculated. This is used to determine the effect of Bob's action of multiplying `x` elements by -1.

4. **Optimal Removal by Alice:**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements. The program iterates from 0 to `k` to consider all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove.
   - For each possible number of removals `i`, the sum `s` is updated by subtracting the `i`-th smallest element from the array.
   - The sum `s2` is also updated to reflect the removal of the `i`-th smallest element and the addition of the next smallest element if `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the array.

5. **Optimal Multiplication by Bob:**
   - Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1. The program calculates the new sum after Bob's action by subtracting twice the sum of the smallest `x` elements from the current sum `s`.
   - This is done for each possible number of removals by Alice, and the results are stored in the list `pos`.

6. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The maximum value from the list `pos` is returned, which represents the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob have played their moves.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It sorts the array, which is necessary for optimal play.
- It considers all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove and calculates the resulting sum after Bob's optimal action.
- The logic for updating the sums and finding the maximum possible sum is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
