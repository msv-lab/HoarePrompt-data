Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s2` is updated by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value.
- The value of `s2` was previously `s2 - elements[-i]`, and now it is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
- The values of `removals`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, but `i` is still incremented by 1, and `s` is still reduced by `elements[-i]`.
- The initial conditions that `removals` must be greater than 0 and the updates to `i` and `s` are still valid.
