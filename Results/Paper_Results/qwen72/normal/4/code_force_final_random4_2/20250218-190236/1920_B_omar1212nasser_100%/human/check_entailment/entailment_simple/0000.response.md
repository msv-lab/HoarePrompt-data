### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the least beneficial to the sum) and Bob to multiply the largest elements by -1 (which are the most beneficial to minimizing the sum).

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum `s` of the array `a` is calculated.
   - The sum `s2` of the last `x` elements (which Bob will potentially multiply by -1) is also calculated.

4. **Optimal Removals and Negations**:
   - The program iterates through the possible number of removals `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - For each removal, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the smallest element that Alice can remove.
   - It also updates `s2` to reflect the changes in the sum of the elements that Bob can multiply by -1.
   - The program then calculates the potential sum after Bob's negations and appends it to the list `pos`.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after Alice's removals and Bob's negations.

### Issues:
- **Indexing and Range**:
  - The program uses negative indexing to access elements from the end of the sorted list. However, the loop iterates from 1 to `removals + 1`, which can lead to out-of-bounds errors if `removals` is too large. Specifically, `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(negatives + i)]` can go out of bounds if `i` is greater than the length of the list.
  - To fix this, the loop should iterate from 0 to `removals` and use positive indexing.

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum `s` is updated by subtracting `elements[-i]`, which is incorrect because it should subtract the smallest elements that Alice can remove, not the largest.
  - The sum `s2` is updated similarly, which is also incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[:negatives]))
    s2 = sum(elements[:negatives])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        if i <= len(elements):
            s -= elements[i - 1]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 -= elements[i - 1]
            s2 += elements[negatives + i - 1]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    return max(pos)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has issues with indexing and sum calculation, which can lead to incorrect results or out-of-bounds errors.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
