Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= `elements[i]` <= 1000, `pos` is a list containing a single element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.
- The code appends the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to the list `pos`.
- `elements[-negatives:]` refers to the last `negatives` elements of the list `elements`.
- `sum(elements[-negatives:])` calculates the sum of these last `negatives` elements.
- `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` is then appended to the list `pos`.
- The states of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The list `pos` now contains one element, which is the result of the calculation `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
