The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which is generated by calculating `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of a loop that runs `removals` times. Here, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` adjusted by the loop. The final state of the program includes a modified list `pos` containing these calculated values, and the original parameters `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged.
