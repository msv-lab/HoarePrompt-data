The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `removals` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `removals` must still be greater than `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `removals` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be `i + 1` (which means it will be `i + 2` from the previous state)
- `removals` must be greater than `i + 1` (which means it must be greater than `i + 2` from the previous state)

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `removals` must be greater than `i + 2`**
