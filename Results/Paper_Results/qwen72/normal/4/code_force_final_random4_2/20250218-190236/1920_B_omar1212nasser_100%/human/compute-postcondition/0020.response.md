Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `removals` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s2` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value.
- The other variables and conditions (`i`, `removals`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
