Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]` and `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`. `pos` is updated to include the value `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]` based on the initial condition.
- The value of `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise it is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`.
- The list `pos` is updated to include the value `s - 2 * s2`.
- The other conditions and constraints in the initial state remain unchanged.
