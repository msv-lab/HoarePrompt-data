Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= `elements[i]` <= 1000, `pos` is a list containing a single element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**
