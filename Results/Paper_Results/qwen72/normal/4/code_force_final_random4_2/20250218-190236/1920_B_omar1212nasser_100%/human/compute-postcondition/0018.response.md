Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `removals` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`** 

Explanation: The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting the value of `elements[-i]` from it. Since `i` is `i + 2`, the value of `s` is now `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`. The conditions for `i` and `removals` remain unchanged.
