To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `costs`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k.
- Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `i` is `n - k + 1`.
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `n` is `n % (n - k + 1)`.

Let's break down the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **Identify the loop head variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i` and `costs`:**
   - `i` is currently `n - k + 1`.
   - `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will iterate over the elements of `costs`. Since `costs` has two elements, the next value of `i` will be the second element of `costs`, which is `1`.

4. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `costs` to iterate over. Since `costs` has two elements, the loop will execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is now `1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `curr`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is 1, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `n` is `n % (n - k + 1)`**.
