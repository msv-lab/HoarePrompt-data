Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1) + n`. `i` is 1. `curr` is `n`. `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) - n`.**

Explanation:
- `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`, which is `n`. Therefore, `h` becomes `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1) + n`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n % (n - k + 1) - n`, which simplifies to a negative value or zero, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`, `curr`) retain their initial values or expressions.
