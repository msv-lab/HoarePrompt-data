Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`. `i` is 1. `curr` is `n // 1` which simplifies to `n`. `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) - i * curr` which simplifies to `n % (n - k + 1) - n`.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` remain positive integers with the given constraints.
- `costs` remains a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` remains `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`.
- `i` is still 1.
- `curr` is updated to `n // i`, which simplifies to `n // 1`, and thus `curr` is now `n`.
- `n` is updated to `n % (n - k + 1) - i * curr`, which simplifies to `n % (n - k + 1) - n`.
