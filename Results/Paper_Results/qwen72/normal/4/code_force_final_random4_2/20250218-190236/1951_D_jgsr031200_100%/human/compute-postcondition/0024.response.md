Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts, and `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: The loop starts with `n` and `k` being positive integers within the specified range, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. The list `costs` contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, and `h` is initialized to 0.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1`.
   - `curr` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1)`.
   - `h` is updated to `h + curr`, which is `n // (n - k + 1)`.
   - `n` is updated to `n - (n - k + 1) * curr`, which simplifies to `n % (n - k + 1)`.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - The second element of `costs` is 1.
   - `curr` is calculated as `n // 1`, which is simply `n`.
   - `h` is updated to `h + curr`, which is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`.
   - `n` is updated to `n - 1 * curr`, which simplifies to `n - n`, resulting in `n` being 0.

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - The loop does not execute a third time because `n` is now 0, and the loop condition `for i in costs` will not be met again.

### Final State:
- **`h`**: The value of `h` is the sum of the quotients from the first and second iterations, which is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1)`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is 0 after the second iteration.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is as described above.
