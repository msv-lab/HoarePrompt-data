The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, it is given that the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
