Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is 1, `curr` is `n % (n - k + 1)`, `n` is `n % (n - k + 1)`**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` remain positive integers with the same constraints.
- `costs` remains a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` remains `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `curr` is updated to `n // i`, which simplifies to `n // 1` or simply `n`.
- `n` is already `n % (n - k + 1)` from the initial state, so `curr` is now `n % (n - k + 1)`.
