Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the result in the list `l`.
- The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, and `n` and `k` are the first and second integer inputs, respectively. These conditions are still valid after the code execution.
- The list `l` is now populated with integers provided by the user.
