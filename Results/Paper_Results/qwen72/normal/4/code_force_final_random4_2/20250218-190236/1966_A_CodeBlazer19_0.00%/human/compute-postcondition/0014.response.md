The function `func` is expected to accept a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards, and two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `2 <= k <= 100`. The list `c` should have a length of `n` and each element should be an integer such that `1 <= c_i <= 100`. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. Assuming the function should include these parameters, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `c` and two integers `n` and `k`. The list `c` has a length of `n`, and each element `c_i` is an integer between 1 and 100. The integer `n` is between 1 and 100, and `k` is between 2 and 100. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.**
