Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.** 

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `l` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The user's input for `l` is split into individual strings and then converted to integers before being stored in the list `l`.
