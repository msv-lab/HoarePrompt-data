Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is 1, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, `t` must be greater than 1**. 

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
