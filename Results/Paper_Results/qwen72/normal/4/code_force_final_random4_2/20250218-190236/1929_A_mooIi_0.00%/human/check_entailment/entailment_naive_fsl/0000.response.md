Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output the sorted array `1 2 3` instead of the maximum beauty value.

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve calculating the maximum possible sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty based on the sorted order. However, the program provided does not perform this calculation.
