The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the list `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. The variable `n` is also not directly involved in the loop head, but it affects the list `a`, which is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `_` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop, as it is the loop counter.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
