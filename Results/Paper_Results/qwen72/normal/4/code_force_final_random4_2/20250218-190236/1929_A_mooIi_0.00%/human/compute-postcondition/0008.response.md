The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the range of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1. The loop will execute again if `_` is incremented by 1 and the new value of `_` is less than the range provided by `int(input())`.

However, the range provided by `int(input())` is not a state that can be adjusted, and the variable `_` is a loop counter that is automatically incremented by the loop. Therefore, the state of `_` at the start of the next iteration will be 2, and the loop will execute again if the range provided by `int(input())` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is 2, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, `t` must be greater than 1.**
