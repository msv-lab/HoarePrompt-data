Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) from 1 to `n`.
- `_` is 0.
- `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is a list of `n` integers, each within the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
2. **Sorting `a`**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Map Object `ar`**: The `ar` variable is a map object that contains the string representations of the sorted integers from the list `a`. This is achieved by applying the `str` function to each element of the sorted list `a`.
4. **Joining `ar`**: The `join` method is used to concatenate the string representations of the sorted integers in `ar` into a single string, with each integer separated by a space.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a single string where the sorted integers from the list `a` are concatenated, separated by spaces.

Output: **"a_1 a_2 a_3 ... a_n" (where a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are the sorted integers from the list `a`)**

This means that the output will be a space-separated string of the sorted integers in the list `a`.
