### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `r` (height), `w` (width), `a` (Alice's row), `b` (Alice's column), `c` (Bob's row), and `d` (Bob's column).

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The function first checks if `a` (Alice's row) is greater than `c` (Bob's row). If this is true, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet.

3. **Optimal Moves Calculation:**
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, the function calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. This represents the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move optimally.
   - The function then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even:
     - **Odd Difference:**
       - It calculates `l` as the maximum of 1 and `d - x` (Bob's column minus the number of moves).
       - It calculates `r` as the minimum of `w` and `d + x` (Bob's column plus the number of moves).
       - It then checks if Alice can move to Bob's position within the next `x + 1` moves. If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".
     - **Even Difference:**
       - It calculates `l` as the maximum of 1 and `b - x` (Alice's column minus the number of moves).
       - It calculates `r` as the minimum of `w` and `b + x` (Alice's column plus the number of moves).
       - It then checks if Bob can move to Alice's position within the next `x` moves. If `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

4. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The function ensures that the calculated positions `l` and `r` do not go beyond the board boundaries by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - The logic correctly accounts for the fact that if the difference in rows is odd, Alice has the advantage of moving first and can potentially win. If the difference is even, Bob can potentially win because he will be the one to move last in the sequence of moves.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem's requirements and constraints. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions and the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make. The boundary conditions are also handled appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
