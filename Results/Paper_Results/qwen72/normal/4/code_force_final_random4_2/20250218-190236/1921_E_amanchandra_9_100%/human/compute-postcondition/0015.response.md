Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, and `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an odd number, `l` is `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is `min(w, d + x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an even number, `l` is `max(1, b - x)` and `r` is `min(w, b + x)`.***
