Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. The function then determines and prints the outcome of a game based on the values of these integers. If `a` is greater than `c`, it prints 'Draw'. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, it calculates `x` as the integer division of `abs(a - c)` by 2. Depending on whether `abs(a - c)` is odd or even, it further calculates `l` and `r` and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on specific conditions involving `l`, `r`, `b`, and `d`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the input variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` being in their final states as determined by the input and the conditions within the function. **
