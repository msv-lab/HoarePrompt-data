Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `x` is still the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `l` is still the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
