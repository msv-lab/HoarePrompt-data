Let's break down the given code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.
- `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
- `x` is calculated as `(c - a) // 2`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, b - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, b + x)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`**:
   - `x` is the integer division of the difference between `c` and `a` by 2.
   - \( x = \frac{c - a}{2} \)

2. **Calculate `l`**:
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
   - \( l = \max(1, b - x) \)

3. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - \( r = \min(w, b + x) \)

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are true, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x]` will evaluate to `['Bob']`.
   - If either condition is false, the expression will evaluate to `['Draw']`.

5. **Unpack and Print**:
   - The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the list.
   - If the condition is true, it will print `Bob`.
   - If the condition is false, it will print `Draw`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be either `Draw` or `Bob` depending on the values of `l`, `r`, `d`, and `x`.

Output: **Draw or Bob (where the output is determined by the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`, with `l = max(1, b - x)`, `r = min(w, b + x)`, and `x = (c - a) // 2`)**
