Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is `(c - a) // 2`, the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an odd number, `l` is `max(1, d - x)`, `r` is `min(w, d + x)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `min(w, d + x)`.
- `x` is calculated as `(c - a) // 2`, and since the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an odd number, `x` will be a specific integer value.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, d - x)`, and remains unchanged.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain as they were initially.
- The conditions that `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, and the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an odd number are still valid.
