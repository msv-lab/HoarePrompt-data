The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal provided.

Output: **Draw**
