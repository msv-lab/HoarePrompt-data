Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is calculated as the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
- `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, which means `x = (abs(a - c) // 2)`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The value of `l` will be either 1 or `b - x`, whichever is greater.
