Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
