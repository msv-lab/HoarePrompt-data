Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `_` remains 2.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are still integers provided by the user.
- `x` is still the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`.
- `l` is still the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.
