Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.
- `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
- `x` is `(c - a) // 2`.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an odd number.
- `l` is `max(1, d - x)`.
- `r` is `min(w, d + x)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`**:
   - `x` is defined as `(c - a) // 2`.
   - Since the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is an odd number, `(c - a)` is odd.
   - When an odd number is divided by 2 using integer division, the result is `floor((c - a) / 2)`, which is an integer.

2. **Calculate `l`**:
   - `l` is defined as `max(1, d - x)`.
   - `d - x` is an integer.
   - `l` will be the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r` is defined as `min(w, d + x)`.
   - `d + x` is an integer.
   - `r` will be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - The condition in the `print` statement is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are both integers.
   - `b` is an integer provided by the user.
   - `x + 1` is an integer.

### Condition Breakdown:
- `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`:
  - This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
- `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`:
  - This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

### Output Determination:
- If both conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are true, the `print` statement will output `['Alice']`.
- If either condition is false, the `print` statement will output `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `l`, `r`, and `x`. However, based on the given conditions, the output will be either `['Draw']` or `['Alice']`.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (where the output is determined by the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`)**
