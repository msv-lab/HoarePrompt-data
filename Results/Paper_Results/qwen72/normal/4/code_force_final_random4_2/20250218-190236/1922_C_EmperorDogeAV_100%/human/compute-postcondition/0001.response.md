The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the expression `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Since `n` is already at least 2, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, `i` should start at 0, and `n` should be at least 2.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0**
