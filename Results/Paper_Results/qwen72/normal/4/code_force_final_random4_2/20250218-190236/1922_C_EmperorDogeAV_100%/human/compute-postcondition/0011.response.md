Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0 or greater than 0. If `i` < `n - 1`, and `i` > 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` and `forward` retain their initial values. Additionally, the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**
