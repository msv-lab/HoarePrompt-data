Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Closest City Calculation**: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the closest city for each city, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the closest city. Specifically, the function should determine the closest city for each city and store the distance to that closest city. However, the current implementation incorrectly sets the closest city to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to the distance to the forward city otherwise. This is not the correct way to determine the closest city.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are intended to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city. However, the way these are calculated and used in the program is incorrect. The prefix sums should be based on the minimum distance to the closest city, not the current implementation which seems to be based on the distance to the forward city.

3. **Query Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the queries. It should calculate the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` by considering both direct travel and travel via the closest city. The current implementation simply subtracts prefix sums, which does not account for the possibility of traveling to the closest city for a fixed cost of 1 coin.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the closest city for each city
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest[i] = 1  # The closest city to the first city is the second city
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest[i] = n - 2  # The closest city to the last city is the second last city
        else:
            if cities[i + 1] - cities[i] <= cities[i] - cities[i - 1]:
                closest[i] = i + 1  # The closest city is the forward city
            else:
                closest[i] = i - 1  # The closest city is the backward city
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to travel from city i to city j
    def min_cost(a, b):
        if a == b:
            return 0
        cost = 0
        while a != b:
            if a < b:
                if closest[a] == a + 1:
                    cost += 1
                    a = closest[a]
                else:
                    cost += abs(cities[b] - cities[a])
                    a = b
            else:
                if closest[a] == a - 1:
                    cost += 1
                    a = closest[a]
                else:
                    cost += abs(cities[a] - cities[b])
                    a = b
        return cost
    
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_cost(a - 1, b - 1))
```

This corrected version:
- Properly calculates the closest city for each city.
- Uses a function `min_cost` to determine the minimum cost to travel from one city to another, considering both direct travel and travel via the closest city.
- Handles the queries correctly by using the `min_cost` function.

The original program does not meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
