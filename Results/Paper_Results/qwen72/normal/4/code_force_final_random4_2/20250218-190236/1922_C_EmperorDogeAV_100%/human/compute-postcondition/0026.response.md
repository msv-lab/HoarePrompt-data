Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is 999999999999999999.**

The value of `back` remains unchanged at -99999999999999999999, and the values of `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, `i`, and `forward` remain the same as in the initial state.
