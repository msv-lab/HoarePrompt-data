### Reasoning:

1. **Uniqueness Constraint:**
   - The problem description states that the closest city for each city is unique. This means that for any city `i`, there is exactly one city `j` such that the distance between `i` and `j` is the smallest among all other cities. The program does not explicitly check for this uniqueness constraint, but it is assumed that the input will always satisfy this condition. Therefore, the program does not need to enforce this constraint.

2. **Logical Error in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the cost to travel to the closest city for each city. However, the function incorrectly updates the `prog_cities` list with a value of 1 when the forward city is closer, instead of storing the index of the closest city. This is a significant logical error.
   - The correct approach should be to store the index of the closest city (either the city before or the city after) in `prog_cities` rather than the distance. This would allow the main loop to correctly compute the minimum number of coins required for each query by following the closest city path.

3. **Correctness of the Main Loop:**
   - The main loop uses the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists to compute the minimum number of coins required for each query. These lists are supposed to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city from the start or end of the list, respectively.
   - However, because `func_1` is incorrectly storing distances instead of indices, the cumulative sums in `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are also incorrect. This leads to incorrect results for the queries.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the given example:
     ```
     1
     5
     0 8 12 15 20
     5
     1 4
     1 5
     3 4
     3 2
     5 1
     ```
     - The program produces the correct output:
       ```
       3
       8
       1
       4
       14
       ```
     - However, this is coincidental and does not guarantee the program's correctness for all inputs. The program will fail for inputs where the closest city is not correctly identified due to the logical error in `func_1`.

5. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     0 8 12 15 16
     5
     1 4
     1 5
     3 4
     3 2
     5 1
     ```
     - The correct closest city for city 4 should be city 3, but the program might incorrectly identify city 5 as the closest city due to the logical error in `func_1`. This would lead to incorrect results for the queries involving city 4.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function, which leads to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
