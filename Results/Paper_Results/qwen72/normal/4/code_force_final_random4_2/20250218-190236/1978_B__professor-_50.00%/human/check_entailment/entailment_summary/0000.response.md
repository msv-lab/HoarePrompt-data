Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`.
     - The program correctly handles this case by printing `n * a`.

   - **Case 2**: `b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
     - The program correctly handles this case by printing the result of this formula.

   - **Case 3**: `b - a < n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - (b - a) + 1`, which is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1))`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - The program correctly handles this case by printing the sum of these two parts.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct profit for each test case based on the conditions described.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `b = a` and `b - a = n` correctly.
   - The program also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (up to `10^9`) without issues, as the arithmetic operations are straightforward and do not cause overflow in Python.

5. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input as expected and prints the correct output for each test case.
   - The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined after each iteration, which is expected behavior for a loop that processes multiple test cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the specified conditions and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
