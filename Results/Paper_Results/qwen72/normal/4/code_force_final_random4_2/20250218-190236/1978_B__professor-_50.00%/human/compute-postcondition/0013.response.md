The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from the previous iteration), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
