To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `b` is greater than `a`.
   - `b - a` is less than `n`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
   - Let's denote `b - a` as `d`. According to the precondition, `d` is a positive integer and `d < n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `d = b - a`
   - The expression becomes: `int(d / 2 * (d + 1) + a * n)`.

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `d / 2 * (d + 1)` is the sum of the first `d` integers. This is because the sum of the first `k` integers is given by the formula \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\).
   - Therefore, `d / 2 * (d + 1)` is the sum of the first `d` integers.
   - `a * n` is simply `a` multiplied by `n`.

5. **Combining the Terms:**
   - The expression `int(d / 2 * (d + 1) + a * n)` combines the sum of the first `d` integers with `a * n`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression `int(d / 2 * (d + 1) + a * n)`.
   - Since `d` is `b - a`, the final output can be described as the integer value of \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\).

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\) (where \(b - a\) is the difference between `b` and `a`, and `a` and `n` are the input integers)**
