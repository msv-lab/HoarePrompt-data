You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each iteration. For each iteration, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the loop prints `n * a`. If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, the loop prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints one of three possible results: `n * a` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` if `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` if `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined as they are re-assigned in each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b - a < n` but `b - a` is odd. In this scenario, the division `(b - a) / 2` will result in a floating-point number, which, when cast to an integer, will truncate the decimal part, leading to an incorrect calculation of the profit.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 3 7
```
Here, `n = 5`, `a = 3`, and `b = 7`. The optimal `k` is 4, and the profit should be calculated as:
- First 4 buns at modified prices: 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 22
- Remaining 1 bun at the usual price: 3
- Total profit: 22 + 3 = 25

However, the program calculates:
- `(b - a) / 2 = (7 - 3) / 2 = 2.0` (truncated to 2)
- `(b - a + 1) = 4 + 1 = 5`
- `2 * 5 + 3 * 5 = 10 + 15 = 25`

But the correct calculation should be:
- `int((b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2) + a * (n - (b - a)) = int(5 * 4 / 2) + 3 * 1 = 10 + 3 = 13`

This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle this edge case correctly.
