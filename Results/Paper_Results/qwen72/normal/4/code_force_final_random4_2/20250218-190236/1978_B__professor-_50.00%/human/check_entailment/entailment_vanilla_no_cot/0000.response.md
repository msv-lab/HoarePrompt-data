Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the maximum profit in all scenarios. Specifically, the logic for the case where `b - a < n` is incorrect. The formula used in the else block is not correctly calculating the profit for the scenario where the modified price range is less than the total number of buns.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit_from_k = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))
            profit_from_remaining = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_k + profit_from_remaining)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the profit by first determining the optimal `k` (which is the minimum of `n` and `b`), then calculating the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price, and finally adding the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. This ensures that the maximum profit is obtained in all scenarios.
