Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints one of three possible results: `n * a` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` if `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` if `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined as they are re-assigned in each iteration. **
