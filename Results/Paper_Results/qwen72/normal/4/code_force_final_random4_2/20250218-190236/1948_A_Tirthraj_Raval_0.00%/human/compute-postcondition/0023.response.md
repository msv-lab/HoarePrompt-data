Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`: This means `t` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `t` is not provided.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer.
   - If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times.
   - `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

The `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The initial state and the variables mentioned do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions provided.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
