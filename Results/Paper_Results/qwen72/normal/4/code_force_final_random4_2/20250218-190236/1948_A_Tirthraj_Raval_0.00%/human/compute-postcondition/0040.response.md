Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `t` after this operation.
2. `n` is an input integer: The value of `n` is provided by the user.
3. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer: This means `n` does not change if it is odd.
4. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times.
5. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list that contains the characters 'A' and 'B' repeated in an alternating pattern, with a total of `n` characters.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state describes the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `pattern`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `pattern`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
