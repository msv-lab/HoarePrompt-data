Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `first` is False.
   - If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement for `i`.
   - The value of `i` is not modified by any conditions or other operations in the given code snippet.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
