Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
   - The print statement `print(i)` will print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the print statement will output the integer 2.

Output: **2**
