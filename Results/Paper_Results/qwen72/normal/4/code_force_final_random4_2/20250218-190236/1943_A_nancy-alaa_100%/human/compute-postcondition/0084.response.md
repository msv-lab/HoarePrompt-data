Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 0, `first` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables do not change, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
