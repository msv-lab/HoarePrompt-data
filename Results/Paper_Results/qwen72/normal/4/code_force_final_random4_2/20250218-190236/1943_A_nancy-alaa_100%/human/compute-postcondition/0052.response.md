Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `i` is 0. If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `first` remains False and the program continues executing the next statement.**
