Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is 2. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
