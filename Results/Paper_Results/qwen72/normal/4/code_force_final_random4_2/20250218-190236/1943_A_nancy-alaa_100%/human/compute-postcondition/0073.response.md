Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is True if there was at least one integer in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was encountered after the first integer that also appeared exactly once. Otherwise, `first` remains False.**

The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer greater than 1, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
