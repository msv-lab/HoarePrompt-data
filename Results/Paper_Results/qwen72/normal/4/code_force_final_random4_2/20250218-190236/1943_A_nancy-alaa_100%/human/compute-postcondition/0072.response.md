The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust `_`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` being less than the value of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be 2, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is True if there was at least one integer in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was encountered after the first integer that also appeared exactly once. Otherwise, `first` remains False.**
