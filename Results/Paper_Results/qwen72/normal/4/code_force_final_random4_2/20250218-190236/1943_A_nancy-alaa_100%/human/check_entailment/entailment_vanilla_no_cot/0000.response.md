Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the constraints given. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case.
2. **Counter Usage**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
   - If an integer `i` is not in the array, it is immediately printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in the array and it is Alice's turn (indicated by `first` being `True`), the program prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can pick the element to ensure it is included in the array `c`, and Bob will not be able to pick it again.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and it is Bob's turn (indicated by `first` being `False`), the program sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice will have the opportunity to pick this element in her next turn.
4. **Output**: The program prints the correct MEX for each test case.

The logic correctly handles the optimal strategy for both players and ensures that the MEX is calculated based on the given constraints and rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
