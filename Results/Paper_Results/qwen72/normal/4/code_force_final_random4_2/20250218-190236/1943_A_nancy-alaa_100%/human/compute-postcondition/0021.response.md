Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is False (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is set to 1, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
