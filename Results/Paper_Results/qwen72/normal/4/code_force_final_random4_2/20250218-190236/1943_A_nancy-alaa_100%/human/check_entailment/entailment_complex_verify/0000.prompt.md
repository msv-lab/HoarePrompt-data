You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: _ is t-1, n is an input integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers input by the user, mpp is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the last `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is True if there was at least one integer in the last `arr` that appeared exactly once and was encountered before any integer that appeared more than once. Otherwise, `first` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then identifies and prints the smallest integer `i` (starting from 0) that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, provided that no integer that appears more than once has been encountered before. If no such integer is found, the function prints the first integer that appears exactly once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the program state is such that all test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The program simply checks for the first missing integer and prints it, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal play by both players. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```
The optimal play should result in the MEX of 4, but the program will output 4 prematurely, not considering the optimal moves by both players. The correct optimal play would be:
1. Alice picks 2 (array becomes [0, 1, 2, 3], c becomes [2]).
2. Bob picks 0 (array becomes [1, 2, 3], c remains [2]).
3. Alice picks 1 (array becomes [2, 3], c becomes [2, 1]).
4. Bob picks 2 (array becomes [3], c remains [2, 1]).
5. Alice picks 3 (array becomes [], c becomes [2, 1, 3]).

At the end, c = [2, 1, 3], and the MEX is 0. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.
