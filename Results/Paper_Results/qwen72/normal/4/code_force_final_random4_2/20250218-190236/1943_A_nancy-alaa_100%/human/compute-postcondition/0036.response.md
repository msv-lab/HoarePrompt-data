The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and the input range. If `_` is less than the input range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if there exists at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `first` remains False.**
