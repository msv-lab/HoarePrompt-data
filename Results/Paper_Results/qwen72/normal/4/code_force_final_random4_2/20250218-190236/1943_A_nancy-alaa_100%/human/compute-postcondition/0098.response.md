The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure `i` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2**
