Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `i` is 2, and `n + 1` must be greater than 2. If `i` (which is 2) is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
