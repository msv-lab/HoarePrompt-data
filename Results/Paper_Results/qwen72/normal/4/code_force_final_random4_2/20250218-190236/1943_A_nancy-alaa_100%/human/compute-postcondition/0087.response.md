Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 0, `first` is True, and the current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.**

In the output state, the variable `first` has been updated to `True`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The value of `mpp[i]` is still 1, and `i` is still 0. The input integer `n` is greater than 1, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. The Counter object `mpp` still contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
