The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then identifies and prints the smallest integer `i` (starting from 0) that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, provided that no integer that appears more than once has been encountered before. If no such integer is found, the function prints the first integer that appears exactly once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the program state is such that all test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.
