The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `x` is initialized to `len(nums) - 1` before the loop, but in the loop head, `x` is redefined by the `range` function, which starts from 0 and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element, and `x` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer**
