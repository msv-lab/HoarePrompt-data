Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `nums` remains unchanged.
- The variable `x` is now equal to the index of the last element in `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.
- The variable `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration.
- The variable `num_tests` is decreased by 1, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
