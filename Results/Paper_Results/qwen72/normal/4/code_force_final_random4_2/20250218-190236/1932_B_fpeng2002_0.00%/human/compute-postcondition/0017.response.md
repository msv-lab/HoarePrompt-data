Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `nums`.
- The value of `x` is updated to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the new `nums` list.
- The value of `start_year` is still the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations, as the code does not affect `start_year`.
- The value of `num_tests` is still decreased by 1, as the code does not affect `num_tests`.
- The value of `n` is still an input integer, as the code does not affect `n`.
