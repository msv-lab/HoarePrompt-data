Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least `num_tests` elements, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations, `num_tests` is decreased by 1.** 

The value of `num_tests` is decreased by 1, while the values of `nums`, `x`, and `start_year` remain unchanged. The list `nums` must still have at least `num_tests` elements, and `start_year` is still the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations.
