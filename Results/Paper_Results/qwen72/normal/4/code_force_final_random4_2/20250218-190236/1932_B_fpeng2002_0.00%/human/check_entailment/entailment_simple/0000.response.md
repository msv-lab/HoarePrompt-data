Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs and the requirement that signs occur sequentially. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

2. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the current sign is expected to occur.

3. **Loop Through Signs**: For each sign, the program updates `start_year` to be the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity (`nums[x]`) that is greater than the previous `start_year`. This is done using the formula:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign starts waiting from the next year after the previous sign occurred.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the integer division of the current year by the periodicity.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next multiple.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the next multiple of the periodicity.

4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by decrementing `num_tests` and repeating the process for each test case.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: `((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign: `((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: 36 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - Second sign: `((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - Third sign: `((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Fourth sign: `((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - Fifth sign: `((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: 5 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - Second sign: `((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - Third sign: `((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - Fourth sign: `((3 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - Fifth sign: `((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: 5 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Start year: 0
  - First sign: `((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - Second sign: `((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - Third sign: `((60 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - Fourth sign: `((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - Fifth sign: `((800 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - Sixth sign: `((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: 2012 (Correct)

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, and it handles all test cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
