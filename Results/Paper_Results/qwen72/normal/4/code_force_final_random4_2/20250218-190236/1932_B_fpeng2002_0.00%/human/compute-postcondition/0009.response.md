Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`.
- The value of `nums` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers input by the user.
- The value of `x` remains 1.
- The new value of `start_year` is calculated using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, which ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`.
