Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the original `start_year`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the original `start_year`.
- The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]` calculates this new value.
- The values of `nums`, `x`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain unchanged.
