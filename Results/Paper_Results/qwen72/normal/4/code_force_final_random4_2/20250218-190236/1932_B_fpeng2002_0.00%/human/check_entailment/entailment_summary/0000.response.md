Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs and the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The logic in the program iterates through the list of periodicities, calculating the next occurrence of each sign starting from the year after the previous sign occurred. This is done using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that the next year is a multiple of the current periodicity and is strictly greater than the previous `start_year`.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Iteration**: For each periodicity in the list `nums`, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that:
   - `start_year + 1` is the year immediately after the last sign occurred.
   - `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)` finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(start_year + 1) / nums[x]`.
   - Multiplying this integer by `nums[x]` gives the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

This approach correctly handles the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The program also processes multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and iterating over them.

Based on the provided example and the execution summary, the program produces the correct output for the given test cases:
- For the first test case with periodicities `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the output is 36.
- For the second test case with periodicities `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is 5.
- For the third test case with periodicities `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the output is 5.
- For the fourth test case with periodicities `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`, the output is 2012.

These outputs match the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
