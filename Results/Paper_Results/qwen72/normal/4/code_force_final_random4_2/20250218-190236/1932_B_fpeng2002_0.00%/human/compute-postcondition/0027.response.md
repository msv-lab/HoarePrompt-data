The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`, and `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
