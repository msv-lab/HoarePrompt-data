Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, otherwise it remains `False`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef0[i]` is 0 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef1[i]` is 1 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements, and it will be populated with indices that were visited during the loop. `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`. `ok` is `False` because `c1` is 0.**
