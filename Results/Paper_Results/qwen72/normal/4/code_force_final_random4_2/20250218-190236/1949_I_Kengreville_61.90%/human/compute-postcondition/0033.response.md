Output State: **`c0` is increased by the sum of `coef0[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is increased by the sum of `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `c0` will have been updated to the sum of the values in the `coef0` list corresponding to each element in the `nodes` list. Similarly, the variable `c1` will have been updated to the sum of the values in the `coef1` list corresponding to each element in the `nodes` list. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`) remain unchanged.
