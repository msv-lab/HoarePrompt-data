Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True` and `visited[j]` is `True`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**

Explanation: The `dfs(j)` function call likely marks the node `j` as visited, updating `visited[j]` to `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `dx`, `dy`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain as specified in the initial state, with the only change being that `visited[j]` is now `True`.
