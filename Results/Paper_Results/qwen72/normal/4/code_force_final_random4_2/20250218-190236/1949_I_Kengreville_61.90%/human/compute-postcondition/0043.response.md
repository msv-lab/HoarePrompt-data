The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `nodes`. For the loop to execute, the list `nodes` must contain at least one element. The variable `j` will take on the value of the elements in `nodes` during each iteration. The initial state provided indicates that `nodes` is an empty list, which means the loop will not execute unless `nodes` is modified to contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` is `False`, and `nodes` must contain at least one element.**
