Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces.
   - `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, otherwise it remains `False`.
   - `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef0[i]` is 0 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef1[i]` is 1 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `nodes` is a list that contains indices that were visited during the loop.
   - `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`.
   - `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`.
   - `ok` is `True`, indicating that `c1` is not 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The value of `ok` is given as `True`, which indicates that `c1` is not 0.
   - Since `ok` is `True`, the condition for printing `'YES'` is satisfied.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
