The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])`**
