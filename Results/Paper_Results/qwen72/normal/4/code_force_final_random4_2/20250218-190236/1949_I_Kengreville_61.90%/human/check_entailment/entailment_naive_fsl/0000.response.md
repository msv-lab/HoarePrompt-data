Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all disks are isolated (i.e., not tangent to any other disk). In such a case, the `dfs` function will not be called for any disk, and the `ok` variable will remain `False`, leading to the program printing `NO`. However, it is always possible to decrease the radii of isolated disks without affecting their tangency, as they do not touch any other disks. Therefore, the program should print `YES` in this case, but it does not. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
5 0 1
10 0 1
```
In this input, all disks are isolated, and the program will print `NO`, which is incorrect.
