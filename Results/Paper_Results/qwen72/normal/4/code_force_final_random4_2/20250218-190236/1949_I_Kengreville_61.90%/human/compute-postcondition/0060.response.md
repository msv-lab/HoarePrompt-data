Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n` with `visited[2]` being `True`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` and `coef0[2]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` and `coef1[2]` being 1, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` is `False`, `nodes` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `c0 = 0` reassigns the value of `c0` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
