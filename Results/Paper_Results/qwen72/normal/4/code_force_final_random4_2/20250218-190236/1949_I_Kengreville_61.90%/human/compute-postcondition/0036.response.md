The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` remains an empty list. If `visited[i]` is `False`, `c0` is increased by the sum of `coef0[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is increased by the sum of `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is now `True` if `c1` is not equal to 0. Otherwise, `ok` remains `False`.**
