Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is `False`, and `nodes` must contain all the elements that were added to it before the loop started.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` also remain unchanged, with `coef0[1]` still being 0 and `coef1[1]` still being 1. The variables `c0` and `c1` are now the sum of the values in `coef0` and `coef1` respectively, for all elements `j` that were in the `nodes` list. The variable `ok` remains `False`. The `nodes` list contains all the elements that were added to it before the loop started.
