Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is now `True`, `nodes` is a list that now includes `i` at the end, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of numbers of length n.**

The code snippet `nodes.append(i)` adds the integer `i` to the end of the list `nodes`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
