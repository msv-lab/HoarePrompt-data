Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. However, it fails to handle cases where there are no such direct pairs but where it is still possible to invite a minimum of 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend the party. Additionally, it does not correctly handle more complex scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required might be greater than 3.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
6
2 3 1 5 6 4
```

The expected output is:
```
2
3
2
3
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
2
2
2
2
```

This is incorrect for the fourth test case, where the minimum number of invitations required is `3` (e.g., inviting friends 1, 2, and 5 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 attend the party).

A correct solution would need to account for all possible configurations of best friends and determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. This might involve identifying cycles and chains in the best friend relationships.
