Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `p` is equal to the third element of `l`, `q` is equal to the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
