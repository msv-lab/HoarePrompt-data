You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i - 1] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits the loop for that test case. If no such index is found after checking all elements, it prints `3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` is 0, `n` is the last input value (1 <= n <= 50), `l` is the last list of integers provided, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find the specified condition for any test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of best friends.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0.
   - The program then enters a while loop that iterates over the list `l`:
     - It checks if the best friend of the current friend (i.e., `q = l[p - 1]`) is the current friend (i.e., `q == i + 1`).
     - If this condition is true, it prints 2 and sets `j` to 1, breaking out of the loop.
     - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints 3.

3. **Logic Evaluation:**
   - The program checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints 2 because sending invitations to both friends in the pair will ensure that both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints 3, which is incorrect. The program should find the minimum number of invitations required, and 3 is not always the correct answer.

4. **Correctness Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends but still, fewer than 3 invitations can ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - For example, in the second test case `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the program prints 3, but the correct answer should be 2 (inviting friends 1 and 2, for instance).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. It assumes that if no pair of friends are each other's best friends, the minimum number of invitations required is always 3, which is not true.

### Correctness:
**False**
