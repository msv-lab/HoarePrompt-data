The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range limit `10`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and it must still be less than `10`.

State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist`, `i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.**
