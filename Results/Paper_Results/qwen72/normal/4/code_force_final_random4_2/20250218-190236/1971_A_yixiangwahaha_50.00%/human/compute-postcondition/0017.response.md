Postcondition: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, `i` is set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration, and the current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`.**
