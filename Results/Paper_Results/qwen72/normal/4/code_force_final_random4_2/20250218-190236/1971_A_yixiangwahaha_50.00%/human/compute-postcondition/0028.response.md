Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `x[1]` is less than `y[1]`, the current value of `x[1]` is less than the current value of `y[1]`. Otherwise, `x[1]` is greater than or equal to `y[1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `y[i]` will be the third element of the list `y`.
   - `x[i]` will be the third element of the list `x`.
   - Since `x` and `y` are lists containing the same integer value repeated ten times, `x[1]` and `x[2]` will have the same value, and `y[1]` and `y[2]` will have the same value.
   - Therefore, `x[2]` will be the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, and `y[2]` will be the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The print statement will output the third element of `y` followed by a space and the third element of `x`.
   - Since `x[2]` and `y[2]` are the same as `x[1]` and `y[1]` respectively, the output will be the integer value of the second element of `xylist` followed by a space and the integer value of the first element of `xylist`.

Output: **y[2] ' ' x[2] (where y[2] is the integer value of the second element of `xylist` and x[2] is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`)**
