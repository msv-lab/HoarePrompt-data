Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads exactly 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`. According to the problem, `t` specifies the number of test cases, and the program should read `t` pairs of integers, not always 10 pairs.

2. **Range Mismatch**: The loop that reads the pairs of integers should iterate `t` times, not a fixed 10 times. This is a critical error because it will cause the program to either read too many or too few pairs of integers, depending on the value of `t`.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the minimum and maximum values with an extra space between the numbers and the separating space. This is not strictly incorrect, but it might not match the expected output format exactly. However, this is a minor issue compared to the first two.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
