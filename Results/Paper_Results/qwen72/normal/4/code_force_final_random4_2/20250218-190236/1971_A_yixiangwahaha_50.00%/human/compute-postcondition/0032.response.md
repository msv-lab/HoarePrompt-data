Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 100). It then reads 10 pairs of integers (0 <= x, y <= 9) from the input, storing them in two lists `x` and `y`. For each of the 10 pairs, the function prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the lists `x` and `y` contain the 10 pairs of integers, and the input `t` remains unchanged. **
