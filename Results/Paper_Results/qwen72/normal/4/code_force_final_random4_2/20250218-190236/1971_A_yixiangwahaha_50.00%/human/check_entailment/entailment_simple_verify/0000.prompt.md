You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4

    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3

    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, `i` is 9.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, and `i` is 9. The loop has completed all 10 iterations, and for each index `i` from 0 to 9, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` were printed in the order `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `y[i]` and `x[i]` were printed in the order `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly for the number of test cases. The problem description specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the program always reads 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This will cause the program to either read too many or too few test cases, leading to incorrect output for some inputs.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```
The program will still try to read 10 test cases, which will result in an error or incorrect output because there are only 3 test cases provided.
