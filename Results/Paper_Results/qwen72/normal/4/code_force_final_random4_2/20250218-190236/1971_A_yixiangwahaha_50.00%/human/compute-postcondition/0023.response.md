Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times.
- `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times.
- `i` is 1.
- If `x[1]` is less than `y[1]`, the current value of `x[1]` is less than the current value of `y[1]`. Otherwise, `x[1]` is greater than or equal to `y[1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `x` and `y` lists:**
   - `x` is a list where each element is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, repeated ten times.
   - `y` is a list where each element is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`, repeated ten times.
   - Since `i` is 1, we are accessing the second element of both `x` and `y` lists.

2. **Values of `x[1]` and `y[1]`:**
   - `x[1]` will be the integer value of the first element of `xylist`.
   - `y[1]` will be the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition states that if `x[1]` is less than `y[1]`, then `x[1]` is less than `y[1]`. Otherwise, `x[1]` is greater than or equal to `y[1]`.
   - This condition is always true by definition, so it doesn't provide new information but confirms the relationship between `x[1]` and `y[1]`.

### Output:
The code will print the values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` separated by a space. Since `x[1]` and `y[1]` are the integer values of the first and second elements of `xylist` respectively, the output will be:

Output: **x[1] ' ' y[1] (where x[1] is the integer value of the first element of xylist and y[1] is the integer value of the second element of xylist)**
