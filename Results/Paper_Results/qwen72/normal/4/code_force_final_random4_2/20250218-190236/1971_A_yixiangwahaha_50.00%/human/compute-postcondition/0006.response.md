Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist`, `i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.**

The code snippet `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` adds the integer value of the second element of `xylist` to the list `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
