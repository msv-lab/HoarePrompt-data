Reasoning:  
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling for `t`:** The variable `t` is read as a string but not converted to an integer. This is not a critical issue because `range(t)` can still work with a string input in Python 3, but it is not the best practice. However, the more significant problem is that the program does not use `t` to determine the number of test cases to process. Instead, it always processes exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`.

2. **Number of Test Cases:** The program always processes 10 test cases, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the number of test cases `t` can vary from 1 to 100, and the program should process exactly `t` test cases.

3. **Output Format:** The program prints the minimum and maximum values with an extra space between the two integers. This is not strictly incorrect, but it is not the most concise format. The problem description does not specify the exact format, but typically, a single space is sufficient and more standard.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the number of test cases as specified in the problem description, which is a critical error.

Correctness: **False**
