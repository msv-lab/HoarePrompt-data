Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `x[1]` is less than `y[1]`, the current value of `x[1]` is less than the current value of `y[1]`. Otherwise, `x[1]` is greater than or equal to `y[1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `i` is 2.
   - `x[i]` will be the third element of the list `x` (since list indices are 0-based).
   - `y[i]` will be the third element of the list `y` (since list indices are 0-based).
   - Since `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `x[2]` will be the same as `x[1]`, which is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`.
   - Similarly, since `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, `y[2]` will be the same as `y[1]`, which is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the third element of `x` and the third element of `y`, separated by a space.
   - Based on the precondition, `x[1]` and `y[1]` are the same values as `x[2]` and `y[2]` respectively.
   - Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the first element of `xylist` and the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.

Output: **x[2] ' ' y[2] (where x[2] is the integer value of the first element of `xylist` and y[2] is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`)**
