Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, `i` is 9.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, and `i` is 9. The loop has completed all 10 iterations, and for each index `i` from 0 to 9, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` were printed in the order `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `y[i]` and `x[i]` were printed in the order `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.
