Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`, followed by the permutation itself. This part is accurate.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The function `func_1` implements the binary search algorithm. The initial values for `l` and `r` are set to 0 and `n` respectively, which is correct for a 0-indexed array. The loop continues until `r - l` is greater than 1, which is the standard termination condition for binary search. This part is also accurate.

3. **Middle Index Calculation**: The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which is the correct way to find the midpoint in a binary search. This part is accurate.

4. **Comparison and Update**: The program updates `l` or `r` based on whether the element at the middle index `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`. This is the correct logic for binary search. This part is accurate.

5. **Result Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `find`. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of `l` and the actual position of `find` in the array, indicating that a single swap is needed to make the binary search work correctly. This part is accurate.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) and the indices for the swap if needed. This part is accurate.

7. **Handling Multiple Swaps**: The original assessment correctly points out that the program is designed to only handle a single swap, which is not sufficient for the problem statement that allows up to 2 swaps. The function `func_1` does not have the logic to determine if a second swap is necessary or to perform it. This is a significant oversight and makes the program incorrect.

8. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where more than one swap might be necessary. For example, if the permutation is such that the target value `x` is in a position that requires two swaps to be correctly found by the binary search, the program will fail. The original assessment is correct in identifying this issue.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the requirement of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.

Final: **False**
