Postcondition: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is at most 1, and `array[l]` is the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or `l` is 0 and `r` is 1 if `find` is less than `array[0]`. Additionally, the current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
