Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is n.** 

The initial state is preserved, and the variables `l` and `r` are now initialized to 0 and the length of `array` (`n`), respectively.
