Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `r - l` must be greater than 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`.
- The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `r - l` must be greater than 1 still holds true.
- The initial state information about `array`, `find`, and `n` remains valid.
