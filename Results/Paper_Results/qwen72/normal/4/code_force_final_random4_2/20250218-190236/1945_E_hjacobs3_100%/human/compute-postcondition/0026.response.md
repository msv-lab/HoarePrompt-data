Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two string values: the first value is the string representation of the index (plus 1) of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, or "1" if `find` is less than the first element of the array. The second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1. If the index `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, the function prints "1"; otherwise, it prints "0". **
