Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is at most 1, and `array[l]` is the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or `l` is 0 and `r` is 1 if `find` is less than `array[0]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variables `l` and `r` will be such that the difference between them is at most 1. The variable `l` will point to the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, or if `find` is less than the first element of the array, `l` will be 0 and `r` will be 1. This is the result of the binary search algorithm used in the loop, which narrows down the range of indices to find the position of `find` or the closest element less than or equal to `find` in the sorted permutation `array`.
