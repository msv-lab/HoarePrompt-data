Postcondition: ***`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2. If `array[mid]` <= `find`, `l` is updated to (0 + n) // 2 and `r` remains n. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to (0 + n) // 2.***
