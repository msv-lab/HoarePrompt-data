Postcondition: ***`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `r - l` must be greater than 1. If `array[mid]` <= `find`, `l` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.***
