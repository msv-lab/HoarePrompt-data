The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing two string values. The first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or 0 if `find` is less than `array[0]`. The second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two string values: the first value is the string representation of the index (plus 1) of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, or "0" if `find` is less than the first element of the array. The second value is the string representation of the index (plus 1) of `find` in the array.**
