Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input strings with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `x` is the integer value of the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the integer value of the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))` is executed.
- `i` is 1, so the second characters of `a` and `b` are considered.
- `x` is assigned the integer value of the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b`.
- `y` is assigned the integer value of the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b`.
- The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `q`, `vt`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged.
