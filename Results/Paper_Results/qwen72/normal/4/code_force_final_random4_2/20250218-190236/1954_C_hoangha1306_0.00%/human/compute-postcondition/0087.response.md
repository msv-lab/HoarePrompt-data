Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the integer value of the first character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the first character of `b`. If `vt` is 0 and the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is 0 and the first character of `a` is less than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.***
