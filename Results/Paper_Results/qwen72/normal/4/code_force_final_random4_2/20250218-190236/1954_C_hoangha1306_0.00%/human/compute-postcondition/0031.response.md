Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `kq1` is the string representation of the second character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `a` (or `b` if they were equal), `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` (or `b` if they were equal) concatenated with the second character of `a`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b` if they were not equal, `y` is the larger integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b` if they were not equal, `vt` is either 0 or not 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
