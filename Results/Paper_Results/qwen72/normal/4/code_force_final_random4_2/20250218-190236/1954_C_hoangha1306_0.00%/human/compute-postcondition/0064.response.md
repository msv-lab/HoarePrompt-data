Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is a string containing the characters from `a` and `b` that are equal, and for each pair of characters that are not equal, the character with the lower integer value if `vt` is 1, or the character with the higher integer value if `vt` is 0, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one pair of characters in `a` and `b` that were not equal, otherwise `vt` is 0.**
