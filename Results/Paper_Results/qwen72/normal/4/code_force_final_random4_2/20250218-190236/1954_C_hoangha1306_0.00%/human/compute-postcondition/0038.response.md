Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the smaller integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1. If `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.***
