Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the first character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the first character of `b`, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is a string containing the integer value of the first character of `a`, and `kq2` is a string containing the integer value of the first character of `b`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of the integer value of the first character of `b`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the integer value of the first character of `a`.***
