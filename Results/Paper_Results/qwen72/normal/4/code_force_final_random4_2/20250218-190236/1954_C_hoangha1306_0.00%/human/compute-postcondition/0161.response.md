Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input strings with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, `x` is the integer value of the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the integer value of the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.***
