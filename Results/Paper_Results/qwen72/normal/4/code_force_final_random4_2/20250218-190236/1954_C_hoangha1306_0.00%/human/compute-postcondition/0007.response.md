The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the string `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one character, which means `len(a)` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first index of the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0**
