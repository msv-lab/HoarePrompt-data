The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it takes two input strings `a` and `b` (each representing an integer with digits from 1 to 9 and lengths up to 100). It then generates two strings `kq1` and `kq2` by comparing corresponding digits of `a` and `b`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits are different, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2` for the first differing digit, and the opposite for subsequent differing digits. Finally, it prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case.
