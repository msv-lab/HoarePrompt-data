To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic that forms the string `kq1`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`, where `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters.
- `a` is an input string.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `q` is 1.
- `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters.
- `vt` is 1.
- `kq1` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic.
- `kq2` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic.

### Loop Logic for `kq1`:
Since the loop logic is not explicitly provided, we need to infer it based on the given variables. Typically, such a problem might involve a loop that iterates over the characters of `a` and `b` and constructs `kq1` based on some condition involving `i`, `t`, `q`, and `vt`.

However, without the loop logic, we can only describe the general form of `kq1` based on the given information.

### Explanation:
- `kq1` is constructed based on the characters from `a` and `b`, but the exact construction method is not provided.
- Since `i` is `len(a) - 1`, it starts from the last index of `a`.
- `t`, `q`, and `vt` are integers that might be used in the loop logic to determine how characters from `a` and `b` are combined.

### Output:
Given the lack of specific loop logic, we can only describe `kq1` in a general form. The output will be a string that is constructed based on the characters from `a` and `b` using some loop logic that is not provided.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string constructed based on the characters from `a` and `b` using some loop logic that is not provided)**
