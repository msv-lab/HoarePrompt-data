Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to `n` (this seems to be a typo, likely meant to be `n` is a new input integer).
   - `m` is a new input integer.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` strings.
   - `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together.
   - `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Either the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is not 1, or the first string of `a` is equal to the last string of `a`.
   - The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
