### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an n Ã— m grid the same color by performing a series of operations where you select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

The provided solution works as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (n, m) and the initial colors of the grid.
2. It constructs a list `a` containing the rows of the grid.
3. It creates two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`. `first_row` is composed of the first character of each row, and `last_row` is composed of the last character of each row.
4. It checks two conditions:
   - If the first row of the grid contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last row, it prints "NO".
   - If the `first_row` string contains only one unique character and is not equal to the `last_row` string, it prints "NO".
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
  - This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color (either 'W' or 'B') and if it is different from the last row. If this is true, it means that the first row and the last row are different colors, and since the first row is uniform, there is no way to change the last row to match the first row using the given operations. Hence, the grid cannot be made uniform, and the answer is "NO".
  
- **Condition 2:** `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
  - This condition checks if the first column (represented by `first_row`) is entirely one color and if it is different from the last column (represented by `last_row`). If this is true, it means that the first column and the last column are different colors, and since the first column is uniform, there is no way to change the last column to match the first column using the given operations. Hence, the grid cannot be made uniform, and the answer is "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The solution does not explicitly check if the grid can be made uniform by any other means. However, the conditions it checks are sufficient to determine the impossibility of making the grid uniform in the given scenarios.
- The solution assumes that if neither of the conditions is met, the grid can be made uniform. This is based on the observation that if the first and last rows or columns are not uniform or are the same, it is possible to use the operations to make the entire grid uniform.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly identifies the scenarios where it is impossible to make the grid uniform and prints "NO" in those cases. For all other cases, it prints "YES", which is correct based on the problem's constraints and the nature of the operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
