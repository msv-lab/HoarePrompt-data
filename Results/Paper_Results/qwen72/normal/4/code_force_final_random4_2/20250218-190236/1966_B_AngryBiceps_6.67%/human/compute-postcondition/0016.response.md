Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing three strings (the two initial input strings and one additional input string), `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, and the first character of the string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, and the last character of the string in `a` at index 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. Since `a` contains three strings, `a[-1]` refers to the last string in the list, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that string. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to include this additional character. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
