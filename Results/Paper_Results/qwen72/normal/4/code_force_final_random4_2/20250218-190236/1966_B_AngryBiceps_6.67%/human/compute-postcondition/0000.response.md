The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and starts at 0**
