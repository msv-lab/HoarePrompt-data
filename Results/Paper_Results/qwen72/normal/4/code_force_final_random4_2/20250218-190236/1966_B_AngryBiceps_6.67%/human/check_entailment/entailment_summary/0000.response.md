Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight is that if the first row and the last row (or the first column and the last column) of the grid are not the same color, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color. This is because any operation that changes the color of a subrectangle must start and end with squares of the same color, and if the first and last rows (or columns) are different, there will always be at least one row (or column) that cannot be changed to match the others.

The program checks this condition by:
1. Reading the grid and storing the first and last characters of each row in `first_row` and `last_row`.
2. Checking if the first row contains only one unique character and if this character is different from the corresponding character in the last row.
3. Checking if the first column (constructed from the first characters of each row) contains only one unique character and if this character is different from the last column (constructed from the last characters of each row).

If either of these conditions is met, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Let's analyze the provided test cases to ensure the program's logic is correct:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     W
     B
     ```
   - `first_row = 'WB'`, `last_row = 'WB'`
   - The first row is not all the same color, so the program prints "NO" correctly.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     WWWWBW
     WBWWWW
     BBBWWW
     BWWWBB
     WWBWBB
     BBBWBW
     ```
   - `first_row = 'WWWWWW'`, `last_row = 'BBBBBB'`
   - The first row and last row are different, but the program should still print "YES" because it is possible to make the entire grid white or black through operations. The program's logic is incorrect here.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     W
     ```
   - `first_row = 'W'`, `last_row = 'W'`
   - The grid is already a single color, so the program prints "YES" correctly.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     ```
   - `first_row = 'BB'`, `last_row = 'BB'`
   - The grid is already a single color, so the program prints "YES" correctly.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     BWBW
     WBWB
     BWBW
     ```
   - `first_row = 'BBB'`, `last_row = 'WWW'`
   - The first column and last column are different, but the program should still print "YES" because it is possible to make the entire grid white or black through operations. The program's logic is incorrect here.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     BB
     BB
     WW
     WW
     ```
   - `first_row = 'BWWW'`, `last_row = 'BWWW'`
   - The grid can be made a single color, so the program prints "YES" correctly.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     WWBW
     BBWB
     WWBB
     BBBB
     ```
   - `first_row = 'WBBB'`, `last_row = 'WBBB'`
   - The grid can be made a single color, so the program prints "YES" correctly.

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     WBBWB
     ```
   - `first_row = 'W'`, `last_row = 'B'`
   - The first row and last row are different, so the program prints "NO" correctly.

However, the program fails in Test Case 2 and Test Case 5 because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the first and last rows (or columns) are different but the grid can still be made a single color through operations.

Correctness: **False**
