Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `m` is a new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input values, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` input values concatenated together. If the first element of `a` contains only one unique character and is different from the last element of `a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
