Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is an empty list, indicating that there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. `c` is 2. `i` is `n-1` because fewer than two elements are greater than `x`. `n` is at least 2.**
