The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` remains an empty list, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
