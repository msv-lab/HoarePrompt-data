### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a list of `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination process where the winner of each match moves on to the next.
   - We want to maximize the number of matches won by cow `k` by optionally swapping its position with another cow.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(a)` is designed to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win.
   - The function first identifies the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than cow `k`'s rating.
   - Based on the positions of these cows, it calculates the optimal number of matches cow `k` can win.

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - **Case 1: No cows with higher ratings:**
     - If there are no cows with a rating higher than cow `k`, the function returns `n - 1`.
     - This is correct because cow `k` will win all matches until the end.

   - **Case 2: Exactly one cow with a higher rating:**
     - If there is exactly one cow with a higher rating:
       - If this cow is at position 0, the function returns `k - 1`.
       - If this cow is at a position greater than `k`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.
       - If this cow is at a position less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`.
     - This is correct because:
       - If the higher-rated cow is at position 0, cow `k` can only win up to `k - 1` matches.
       - If the higher-rated cow is at a position greater than `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
       - If the higher-rated cow is at a position less than or equal to `k`, the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` to a position just before the higher-rated cow, which gives `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)` wins.

   - **Case 3: Exactly two cows with higher ratings:**
     - If there are exactly two cows with higher ratings:
       - If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, the function returns `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`.
       - If `k` is greater than the index of the second higher-rated cow, the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`.
       - If `k` is less than or equal to the index of the second higher-rated cow, the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])`.
     - This is correct because:
       - If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
       - If `k` is greater than the index of the second higher-rated cow, the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` to a position just before the first higher-rated cow, which gives `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])` wins.
       - If `k` is less than or equal to the index of the second higher-rated cow, the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` to a position just before the first higher-rated cow, which gives `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])` wins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is the first or last cow in the list.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where there are fewer than two cows with higher ratings.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1(a)` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
