Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in its approach to solving the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Basic Checks**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, it correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because if all cards have the same number, you can perform the operation once and end up with `k - 1` cards. However, if the cards have different numbers, you cannot perform any operations, and the answer should be `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in `nums` and caps it at `k`. This is not necessary for solving the problem and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The program then checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency table does not necessarily mean that the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves calculating the frequency of each number and determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
   - For each number, if its frequency is a multiple of `k`, you can perform the operation until you have `k - 1` cards left.
   - If the frequency is not a multiple of `k`, you will have some remainder cards left after performing the operations.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (5 3, 4 1 1 4 4), the correct answer is 2, which the program outputs. However, this is coincidental and not due to the correct logic.
   - For the second test case (1 10, 7), the correct answer is 1, which the program outputs. This is correct because no operations can be performed.
   - For the third test case (7 2, 4 2 1 100 5 2 3), the correct answer is 1, which the program outputs. This is coincidental and not due to the correct logic.
   - For the fourth test case (10 4, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1), the correct answer is 2, but the program outputs 3. This is incorrect.
   - For the fifth test case (5 2, 3 8 1 48 7), the correct answer is 5, which the program outputs. This is correct because no operations can be performed.
   - For the sixth test case (6 2, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the correct answer is 1, which the program outputs. This is coincidental and not due to the correct logic.
   - For the seventh test case (6 3, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the correct answer is 2, but the program outputs 6. This is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the cases where `k` is not equal to `n` and the frequency of numbers is not a multiple of `k`.
   - The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
