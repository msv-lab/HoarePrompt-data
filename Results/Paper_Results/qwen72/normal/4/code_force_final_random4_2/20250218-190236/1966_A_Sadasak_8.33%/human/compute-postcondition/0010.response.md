The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least one more element after the current `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element of `arr`, and `arr` had at least two elements. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least three elements, and `num` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first and second elements of `arr` as keys. If `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` > `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` remains 1. If `frequency_table[second_element_of_arr]` > `k`, then `frequency_table[second_element_of_arr]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[second_element_of_arr]` is incremented by 1.**
