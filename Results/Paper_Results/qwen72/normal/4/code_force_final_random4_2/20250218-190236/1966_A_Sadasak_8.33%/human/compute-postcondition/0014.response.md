Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value for each key is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `frequency_table` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the list `arr` as a key. The value associated with each key will be the number of times that integer appears in `arr`, but if this count exceeds `k`, the value will be set to `k`. The list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.
