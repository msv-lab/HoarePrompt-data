Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of cards left in a hand after performing a series of operations where `k` cards with the same number are exchanged for `k-1` cards with any chosen numbers. The program processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum number of cards that cannot be further reduced by the given operations.

Let's break down the program and its logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, it means there are not enough cards to perform any exchange, so the minimum number of cards left is `n`.
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means all cards can be exchanged in one operation, leaving `k-1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called to calculate the frequency of each card number in `nums`, but it caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is because any frequency greater than `k` can be reduced to `k` by performing the exchange operation.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` in the `frequency_table`.
   - If such a card number exists, it means one full exchange can be performed, leaving `k-1` cards.
   - If no such card number exists, the program assumes that no further reduction can be made, and it prints `n`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the final calculation. The program should consider the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing the exchange operation, not just whether any single card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`.

### Correct Logic:
- For each card number, if its frequency is a multiple of `k`, it can be completely exchanged, leaving no cards.
- If the frequency is not a multiple of `k`, the remainder when divided by `k` will be the number of cards left for that card number.
- The sum of these remainders for all card numbers will give the minimum number of cards left.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = sum(f % k for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation of the Flaw:
- The original program only checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` and prints `k-1` if so. This is incorrect because it does not account for the total reduction possible by performing multiple exchanges.
- The corrected program calculates the remainder of each frequency when divided by `k` and sums these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the reduction of cards through multiple exchange operations.

Correctness: **False**
