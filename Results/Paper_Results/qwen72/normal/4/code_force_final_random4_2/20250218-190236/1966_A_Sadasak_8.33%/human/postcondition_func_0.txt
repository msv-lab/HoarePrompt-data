The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the count of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k` if the count exceeds `k`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `k`.
