### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` because you cannot perform any operations if `k` is greater than the number of cards. This is correct.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to exchange all `n` cards for `k - 1` cards. This is also correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` and updates the frequency of each number.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it caps it at `k`. This is incorrect because capping the frequency at `k` does not reflect the actual number of cards that can be exchanged. For example, if a number appears 4 times and `k` is 3, you can perform one operation to exchange 3 cards, leaving 1 card, not 3 cards.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After calculating the frequency table, the program checks if any frequency is exactly `k`.
   - If any frequency is `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` cards. This is correct for the specific case where a frequency is exactly `k`.
   - If no frequency is `k`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.

### Correct Approach:
- For each card number, calculate how many full operations can be performed (i.e., how many times `k` cards of the same number can be exchanged).
- The number of cards left for each number after performing the operations should be the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k`.
- The total number of cards left is the sum of these remainders.

### Correctness:
- The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the frequency capping correctly and does not consider multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.

### Final: **False**
