Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` as a key. If `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` > `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[first_element_of_arr]` remains 1. `frequency_table[num]` is now `k`.**
