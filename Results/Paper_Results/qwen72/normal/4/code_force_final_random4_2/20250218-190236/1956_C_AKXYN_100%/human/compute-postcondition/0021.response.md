Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `i` will be 0.
- The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This sum is not affected by the loop's print statements and remains the same as the initial state.
