Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Let's break down the program and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized as an \( n \times n \) matrix where each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). This is done using the line:
     ```python
     mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
     ```

3. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum `res` using the formula:
     ```python
     res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
     ```
   - This formula is derived from the problem of maximizing the sum of the matrix. The sum of the matrix can be maximized by filling it with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \). The formula \( (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \) is used to calculate the sum of the matrix if each row and column is filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \) (since it performs \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations).
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it prints a type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it prints a type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Verification:**
   - The program ensures that the number of operations is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.
   - The operations are valid as they use permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used to calculate `res`. The correct formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} \), where \( a_{i,j} \) is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \). Therefore, the maximum sum should be \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

The current formula \( (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \) does not correctly calculate the maximum sum. The correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the maximum possible values (1 to \( n \)) should be \( n^3 \).

Given this, the program is incorrect in its calculation of the maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
