Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given `i` is 1, the expression evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Since `res` was previously increased by 1, the new value of `res` is 1 + 6 = 7. Therefore, `res` is increased by 6 from its previous value of 1, making the total increase 3 from the initial state where `res` was increased by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
