Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `res` is 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

The code snippet `res = 0` resets the value of `res` to 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `mat`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
