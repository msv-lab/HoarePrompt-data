The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1` and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-2`. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`**
