Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than 0, `i` will be `n-1`.

2. **Determine the value of `res`**:
   - `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - However, the value of `res` is not directly used in the print statement, so we don't need to compute it for this task.

3. **Analyze the print statement**:
   - The print statement uses string formatting to print `'2 %d' % i`.
     - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and it will be replaced by the value of `i`.
   - After that, it prints the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Example Calculation:
- If `n = 3`:
  - `i` would be `3 - 1 = 2`.
  - The range from 1 to `n + 1` would be `range(1, 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will first print `'2 %d' % i`, which will be `'2 2'` (since `i` is 2).
- Then it will print the elements of the range `[1, 2, 3]`.

### General Case:
- For any `n > 0`, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The range from 1 to `n + 1` will be `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **2 [n-1] 1 2 ... n (where [n-1] is the value of `i` and `1 2 ... n` are the elements of the range from 1 to `n` inclusive)**

This format ensures that the output is clear and matches the given precondition and print statement.
