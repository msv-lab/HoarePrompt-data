Let's break down the task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is set to `n`.
   - Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, `i` will be `n`.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement uses string formatting to print `'1 %d' % i`.
     - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `i`.
     - Therefore, `'1 %d' % i` will be `'1 n'` where `n` is the value of `i`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part unpacks the range object, which will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
- The first part of the output will be `'1 n'` where `n` is the value of `i`.
- The second part of the output will be the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
- If `n` is 3, then `i` is also 3.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The output will be: `1 3 1 2 3`.

### General Output:
- For any positive integer `n`, the output will be: `1 n 1 2 3 ... n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of `i` and the sequence is from 1 to n)**
