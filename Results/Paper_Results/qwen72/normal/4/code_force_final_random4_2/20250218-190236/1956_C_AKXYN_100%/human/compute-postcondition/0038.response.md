Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is: `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - The first part of the `print` statement is a formatted string: `'1 %d' % i`.
     - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
     - `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - The second part of the `print` statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
     - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `i` is `n - 1`, the formatted string will be `1 (n - 1)`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will first print the string `1 (n - 1)`.
   - Then it will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 (n - 1) 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and (n - 1) is the value of i)**
