Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is incremented by 3.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` is incremented by 6. However, since the initial state indicates that `res` is incremented by 1, the total increment is 6 + 1 = 7, but the specific increment by the code is 6. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
