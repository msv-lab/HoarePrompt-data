The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. It reads a string `s` from user input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and its length `n` is between 1 and 10^6. The function checks if the string `s` satisfies a condition defined by `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` is `False`, it prints `'YES'`, `1`, and the original string `s`, then exits. If `func_1(s)` is `True`, it searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`. If all characters are the same, it prints `'NO'` and exits. If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, it prints `'YES'`, `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, it prints `'NO'` if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, otherwise it prints `'YES'`, `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
