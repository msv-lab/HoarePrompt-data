### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over them using a `for` loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_2()` to handle each test case.

2. **Palindrome Check:**
   - `func_1(s)` checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`. This is a correct and efficient way to determine if a string is a palindrome.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - In `func_2()`, the program first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string `s` as a single partition. This is correct because a non-palindromic string can be trivially partitioned into a single non-palindromic substring.

4. **Finding a Non-Palindromic Partition:**
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the program searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - If such a character is found, `x` is set to its index. If no such character is found, `x` remains `-1`, indicating that all characters in `s` are the same, making `s` a palindrome of a single character repeated.

5. **Handling All Characters Being the Same:**
   - If `x` remains `-1`, it means `s` is a palindrome of a single character repeated, and no valid partition exists. The program correctly prints "NO" and returns.

6. **Partitioning the String:**
   - If `x` is found, the program then checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts `2`, and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is correct because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic substrings.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`.
     - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO". This is because if `x` is `1`, the substring `s[:x + 1]` is a two-character palindrome, and if `x` is `n // 2`, the substring `s[:x + 1]` is a palindrome of the first half of the string.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts `2`, and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is correct because `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are both non-palindromic substrings.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

**Correctness: **True****
