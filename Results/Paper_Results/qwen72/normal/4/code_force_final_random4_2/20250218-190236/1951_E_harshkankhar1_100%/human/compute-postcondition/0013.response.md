To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables and conditions that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Let's analyze the state and how it should be adjusted:

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the value of the last iteration. Since the loop starts at 1 and increments `i` by 1 each time, after the previous iteration, `i` must have been `k` (where `k` is the last value of `i` in the previous iteration). For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

2. **`n`**: The variable `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. This condition remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

3. **`s`**: The string `s` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

4. **`x`**: The variable `x` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, it is important to note that if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. If the loop did not break in the previous iteration, `x` remains -1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
- If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.
- `s` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same unless the loop breaks in this iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `x` remains -1 unless the loop breaks in this iteration.**
