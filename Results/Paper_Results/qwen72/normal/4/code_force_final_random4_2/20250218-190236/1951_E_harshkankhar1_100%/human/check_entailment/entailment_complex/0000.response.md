Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided in the input. This ensures that the program processes each test case individually.

2. **Palindrome Check**: The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Initial Check for Non-Palindromic String**: In `func_2()`, the program first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition, which is correct because a non-palindromic string can be considered a valid partition of itself.

4. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character**: If `s` is a palindrome, the program searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`. This is done using a loop and the variable `x` is set to the index of the first such character. If no such character is found, `x` remains -1, and the program prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, making it impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Partitioning the String**:
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, the program checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is correct because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
     - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is correct because `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are both non-palindromic.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already non-palindromic.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the string consists of the same character repeated (e.g., "lllllllll").
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings (e.g., "uwuowouwu").

7. **Output Format**: The program adheres to the required output format, printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves when applicable.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
