Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases. The function `func_2` reads a single string from input and processes it, but it does not loop over the number of test cases specified in the first line of the input.

2. **Incorrect Partition Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. The program attempts to find a single character that is different from the first character and then splits the string at that point. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic. For example, if the string is "abba", the program will incorrectly split it into "a" and "bba", where "a" is a palindrome.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is "a" (a single character), it should print "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. However, the program does not account for this.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is not consistent with the problem statement. The program should print "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves, but it sometimes prints "NO" without the required number of parts.

To correct the program, you should:

- Loop over the number of test cases.
- Implement a more robust algorithm to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
- Ensure the output format is consistent with the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_non_palindromes(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n == 1:
        print("NO")
        return
    if n == 2:
        if is_palindrome(s):
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(1)
            print(s)
        return
    if is_palindrome(s):
        # If the entire string is a palindrome, try to split it into two non-palindromic parts
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
                print("YES")
                print(2)
                print(s[:i], s[i:])
                return
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(s)

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        partition_non_palindromes(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version:

- Handles multiple test cases.
- Checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings correctly.
- Ensures the output format is consistent with the problem statement.
