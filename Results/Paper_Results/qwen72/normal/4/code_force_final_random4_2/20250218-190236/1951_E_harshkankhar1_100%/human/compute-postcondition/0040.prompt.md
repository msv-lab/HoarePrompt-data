You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and its length n is such that 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
        #Output:
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and its length n is between 1 and 10^6)
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6), `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True. If any character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to the index of the first such character. If all characters from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `s[0]`, `x` remains -1.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True. `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] ' ' s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that is different from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the first character that is different from s[0] to the end of s)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: aabb ' ' cc
        #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. Additionally, if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, and `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, and if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value. If `x` is not 1 and not `n // 2`, then `x` is not equal to 1 and not equal to `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `None`.

Case_2: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
