Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
   - `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, meaning the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet simply prints the integer `2`.
   - The initial state provides information about the string `s`, its length `n`, the function `func_1`, and the variable `x`, but none of these variables or conditions affect the `print(2)` statement.
   - The value `2` is a constant and does not depend on any other variables or conditions.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(2)` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `func_1`, or `x`.

Output: **2**
