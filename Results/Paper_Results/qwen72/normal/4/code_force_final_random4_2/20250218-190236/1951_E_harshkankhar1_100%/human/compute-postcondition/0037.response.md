Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. Additionally, if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
