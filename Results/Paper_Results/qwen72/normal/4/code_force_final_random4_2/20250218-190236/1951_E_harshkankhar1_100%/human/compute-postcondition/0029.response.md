Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user.
2. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
3. `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning the entire string `s` satisfies some condition defined by `func_1`.
4. `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
5. The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - This means that all characters from index 0 to `x-1` are equal to `s[0]`, and the character at index `x` is different from `s[0]`.

2. **Substrings**:
   - `s[:x + 1]` is the substring from the start of `s` to the character at index `x` (inclusive).
   - `s[x + 1:]` is the substring from the character at index `x + 1` to the end of `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print two substrings separated by a space.
   - The first substring `s[:x + 1]` will contain all characters from the start of `s` up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
   - The second substring `s[x + 1:]` will contain all characters from the first character that is different from `s[0]` to the end of `s`.

### Example:
- Suppose `s = "aaabbbccc"`.
  - `n = 9` (length of `s`).
  - `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning the entire string `s` satisfies the condition.
  - The first character different from `s[0]` (which is 'a') is 'b' at index 3.
  - Therefore, `x = 3`.
  - `s[:x + 1]` is `s[:4]` which is `"aaa"`.
  - `s[x + 1:]` is `s[4:]` which is `"bbbccc"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the first substring `s[:x + 1]` followed by a space and then the second substring `s[x + 1:]`.

Output: **s[:x + 1] ' ' s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the first character that is different from s[0], and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the first character that is different from s[0] to the end of s)**
