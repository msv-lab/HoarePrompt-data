Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to `k + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains as -1 or `k + 1` depending on the previous iteration's condition.***
