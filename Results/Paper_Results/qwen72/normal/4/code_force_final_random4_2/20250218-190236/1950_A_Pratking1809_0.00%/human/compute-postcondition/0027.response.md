The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, it uses digits `a`, `b`, and `c` where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely returns some result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` and digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. It returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
