You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks the relationship between these digits and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input integer `q` and the digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are processed, and the final state of the program is that the results of the comparisons have been printed for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `q`. This is correctly done using `q = int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then iterates `q` times to handle each test case. This is correctly implemented using a `for` loop: `for i in range(q):`.

3. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is correctly done using `map(int, input().split())` which splits the input line into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR". This is correct.
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This is also correct.
   - If neither condition is true, the program prints "NONE". This is correct as well.

5. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program uses two separate `if` statements to check the conditions for a stair and a peak. This means that if both conditions are true (which is not possible with the given constraints), it will print both "STAIR" and "PEAK". However, the problem description ensures that the conditions for a stair and a peak are mutually exclusive, so this is not an issue.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the required output for each test case.

However, there is a minor issue with the logical flow:
- If the first condition `a < b < c` is true, the program will print "STAIR" and then continue to the next `if` statement. If the second condition `a < b > c` is also true (which it cannot be if the first condition is true), it will print "PEAK" as well. This is redundant and can be fixed by using `elif` for the second condition.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Despite this minor issue, the original program will still produce the correct output for the given problem description because the conditions for a stair and a peak are mutually exclusive.

Correctness: **True**
