Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9 and are assigned the values from the input, `q` is greater than 0, `mn` is 100, `i` is 0. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` is false.***
