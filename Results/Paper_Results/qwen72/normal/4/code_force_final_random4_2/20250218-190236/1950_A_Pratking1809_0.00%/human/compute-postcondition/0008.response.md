The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides the following information:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- The condition `a < b > c` is true, meaning `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions; it simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **PEAK**
