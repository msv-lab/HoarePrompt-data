The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition `i < not_mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `not_mid` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `not_mid` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `not_mid` must be greater than 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now assigned the value `big_element - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.**
