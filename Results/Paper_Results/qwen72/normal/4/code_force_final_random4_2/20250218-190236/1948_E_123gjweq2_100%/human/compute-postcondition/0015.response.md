Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` is executed.
- Given that `i` is 0, the expression `left + mid + i` simplifies to `left + mid`.
- The value of `arr[left + mid]` is updated to `big_element - i`, which simplifies to `big_element` since `i` is 0.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
