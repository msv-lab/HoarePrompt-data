The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive). It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each of length `n` with all elements set to 0. It then calls the `make_array` function for each clique, which modifies the `arr` list by setting specific elements to non-zero values. After the loop, the function prints the `arr` list, which contains non-zero values in a specific range based on the number of cliques and the value of `k`. It also prints the number of cliques. Finally, it prints the `cliquess` list, which remains unchanged (all elements are 0). The function does not return any value.
