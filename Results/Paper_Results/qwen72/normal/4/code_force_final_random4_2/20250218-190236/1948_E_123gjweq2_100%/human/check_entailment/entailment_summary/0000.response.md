### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign each vertex an integer from 1 to n such that all integers are distinct.
   - We then need to add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of \( n / k \).
     - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
     - It calls `make_array` for each clique, which modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` lists.
     - It prints the `arr` list, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list.
   - **`make_array`**:
     - It fills the `arr` list with a sequence of integers from `left` to `right` in a specific pattern.
     - It sets the `cliquess` list elements from `left` to `right` to the value of `clique`.

3. **Behavior and Correctness**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques as \( \lceil n / k \rceil \), which is the minimum number of cliques needed to ensure that each vertex is part of a clique.
   - The `make_array` function fills the `arr` list with a sequence of integers in a way that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for vertices within the same clique.
   - The `cliquess` list is correctly populated with the clique number for each vertex, ensuring that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - The function prints the required output format: the `arr` list, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the function correctly assigns `arr` as `[2, 1]` and `cliquess` as `[1, 1]`, forming a single clique.
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \), the function correctly assigns `arr` as `[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]` and `cliquess` as `[1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, forming two cliques.
   - For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \), the function correctly assigns `arr` as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `cliquess` as `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, forming a single clique.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly assigns integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.
