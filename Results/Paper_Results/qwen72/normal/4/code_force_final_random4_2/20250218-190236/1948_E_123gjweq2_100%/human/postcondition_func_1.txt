The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` are filled with a sequence of integers. The first half of this range (from `left + mid - 1` to `left`) is filled with values starting from `left + 1` and increasing by 1, while the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) is filled with values starting from `right + 1` and decreasing by 1. All elements in the `cliquess` array from index `left` to `right` are set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value.
