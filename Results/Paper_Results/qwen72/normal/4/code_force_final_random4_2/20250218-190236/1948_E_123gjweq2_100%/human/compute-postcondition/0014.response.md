The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `mid - 1`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `not_mid` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`**
