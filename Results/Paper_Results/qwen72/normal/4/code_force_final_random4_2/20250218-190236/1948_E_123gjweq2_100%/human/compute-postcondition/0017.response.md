The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `not_mid` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `not_mid` must be greater than 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.**
