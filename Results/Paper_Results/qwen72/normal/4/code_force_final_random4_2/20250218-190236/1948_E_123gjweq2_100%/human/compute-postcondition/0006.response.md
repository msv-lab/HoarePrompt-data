Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is assigned the value `small_element`, `arr[left]` is assigned the value `clique`.**

The value of `arr[left]` is now `clique`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
