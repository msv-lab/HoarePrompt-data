Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `small_element`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - 3]` is `small_element + 2`, `arr[left]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr[left + mid - 3]` to `small_element + 2` because `i` is 2.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
