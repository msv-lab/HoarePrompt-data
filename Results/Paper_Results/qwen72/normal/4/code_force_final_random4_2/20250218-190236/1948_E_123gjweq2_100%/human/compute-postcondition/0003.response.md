Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`, `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is equal to `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is equal to `right - left + 1 - mid`.**

Explanation:
- `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers with `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` remains a positive integer.
- `small_element` remains equal to `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains equal to `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains equal to `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`. This value is now stored in `not_mid`.
