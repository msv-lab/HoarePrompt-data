The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function's output or return value is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function is intended to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, the function processes two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, both between 0 and 9. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
