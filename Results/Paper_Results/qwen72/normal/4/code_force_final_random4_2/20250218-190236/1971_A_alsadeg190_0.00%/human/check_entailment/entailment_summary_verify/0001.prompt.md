You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `x` and `y` are the last input integers, and `i` is `x-1` (where `x` is the number of test cases).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is also correct as it matches the number of test cases.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` for each test case. This is done using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert the input strings to integers. This is correct.

4. **Output Logic**: The program checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If `x` is greater, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This logic is incorrect because the problem description requires the minimum of `x` and `y` to be printed first, followed by the maximum. The current logic prints the maximum first and the minimum second.

5. **Correct Output**: The correct output should be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The program should use `print(min(x, y), max(x, y))` instead of the conditional print statements.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the required logic for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
