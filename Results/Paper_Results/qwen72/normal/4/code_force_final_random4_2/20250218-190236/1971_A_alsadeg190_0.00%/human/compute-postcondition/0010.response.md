Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 1.
- If `x` > `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
- `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y` as they are at the time the statement is executed. Since the initial state does not specify any changes to `x` or `y` after they are input, the values of `x` and `y` will be the same as the values provided by the user.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are the input integers provided by the user)**
