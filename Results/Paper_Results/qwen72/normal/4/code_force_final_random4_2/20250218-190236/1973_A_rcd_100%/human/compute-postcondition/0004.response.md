The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` as integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. The variable `t` is specified to be greater than 0, and `_` is set to 0. However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, which simply prints the constant value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
