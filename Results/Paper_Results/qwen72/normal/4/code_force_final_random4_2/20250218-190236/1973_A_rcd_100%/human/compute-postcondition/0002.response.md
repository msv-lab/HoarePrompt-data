The code snippet `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reads input from the user, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` respectively. The initial state specifies that `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers within the range 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30. After executing the code, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated based on the user input, but they must still adhere to the initial constraints. The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
