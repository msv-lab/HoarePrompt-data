Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the user, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30). The function then checks if the sum of these scores is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. If the sum is even and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it performs a loop to find values `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If such values are found, it prints `p1 - x + p3`; otherwise, it prints `p3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state changes are made to the input variables. **
