Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y < x`, and `p3` is printed. `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented in each iteration, starting from `x = 0` and `y = p3`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The loop starts with `x = 0` and `y = p3`.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
- **If Statement**: Inside the loop, if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed.
- **Else Statement**: If the condition is not met, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is decremented by 1.
- **Termination**: The loop will terminate either when the if condition is met and the loop breaks, or when `y < x`.

### Final State:
- **If the If Condition is Met**: The loop will break and print `p1 - x + p3` at the point where `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y`.
- **If the If Condition is Never Met**: The loop will continue until `y < x`, at which point `p3` will be printed.

The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented in each iteration, starting from `x = 0` and `y = p3`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`) will remain unchanged.
