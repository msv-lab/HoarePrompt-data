Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, there is a logical issue in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws. Let's consider the case where the input is `3 4 5`:

- The total score is 12, which is even, so the program does not immediately return -1.
- The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`, which is `5 >= 3 + 4` (False).
- It then enters a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. However, the logic inside the while loop is flawed. The loop tries to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, but this does not necessarily lead to the correct maximum number of draws.

The correct maximum number of draws for the input `3 4 5` should be 6, but the program will not print 6. Instead, it will print 5, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
