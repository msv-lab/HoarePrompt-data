Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues with the same values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. Otherwise, the loop completes, and `p3` is printed. After all iterations, `x` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `y` is `p3 - x`.***
