The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the initial state.

Output: **-1**
