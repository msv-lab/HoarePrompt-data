The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and `t` is the range that `_` iterates over. Since `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and at the end of the previous iteration `_` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `_` must be less than `t`. Since `t` is greater than 1, the loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p1`. If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. If none of these conditions are met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and `p3` is printed. `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented in each iteration, starting from `x = 0` and `y = p3`.**
