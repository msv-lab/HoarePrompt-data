The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`p_1` is an integer where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `p_2` is an integer where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `p_3` is an integer where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
