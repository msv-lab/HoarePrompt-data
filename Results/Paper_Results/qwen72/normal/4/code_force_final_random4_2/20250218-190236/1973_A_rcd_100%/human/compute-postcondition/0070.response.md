Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `x` is 0.**

The code snippet `x = 0` initializes the variable `x` to 0. The initial conditions for `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even is still valid.
