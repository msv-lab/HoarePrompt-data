Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is updated to 2 and `y` is updated to `p3 - 2`.**
