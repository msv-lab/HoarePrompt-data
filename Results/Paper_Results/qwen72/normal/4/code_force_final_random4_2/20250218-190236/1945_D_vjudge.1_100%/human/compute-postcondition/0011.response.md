Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` (which was infinity) and `a[0] + suff[1]`, `k` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its initial value (which was infinity) and the sum of `a[0]` and `suff[1]`. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value `a[0] + suff[1]`.
