Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, `suff[n - 1]` is `c[n - 1]`, `suff[n - 2]` is `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `suff[i]` to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `suff[n - 2]` is updated to be the sum of `suff[n - 1]` (which is `c[n - 1]`) and `c[n - 2]`. Therefore, `suff[n - 2]` is now `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
