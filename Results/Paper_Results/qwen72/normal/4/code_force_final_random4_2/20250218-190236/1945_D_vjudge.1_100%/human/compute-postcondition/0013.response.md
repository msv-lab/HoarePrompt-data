Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` (which was infinity) and `a[0] + suff[1]`, and `a[1] + suff[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `a[1] + suff[2]`.
- The initial value of `ans` was the minimum of infinity and `a[0] + suff[1]`.
- The value of `i` is 1, so `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `suff[i + 1]` is `suff[2]`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `a[1] + suff[2]`.
