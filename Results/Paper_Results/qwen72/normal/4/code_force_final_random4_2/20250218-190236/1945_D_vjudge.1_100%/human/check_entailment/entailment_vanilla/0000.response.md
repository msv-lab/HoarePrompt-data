### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is done to determine the minimum cost Kirill would have to pay to move past each person in the queue.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This is done to efficiently calculate the total cost of moving past all people from position `i+1` to `n-1`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
   - It iterates over the first `k` positions and for each position `i`, it calculates the cost of moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This cost includes the cost to move to position `i` and the cost to move past all people from `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and the calculated cost.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound. By using the suffix sum array, the program efficiently computes the total cost of moving past people in the queue.
- The iteration over the first `k` positions ensures that Kirill can be among the first `m` people in the line with the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

### Correctness:
**True**
