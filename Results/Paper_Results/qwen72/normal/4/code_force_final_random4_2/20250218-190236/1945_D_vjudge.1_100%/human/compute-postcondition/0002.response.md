The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n - 1`**
