Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, the lists `a` and `b`, and calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization of `c`**: The list `c` is created where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is because Kirill can choose to pay either `a[j]` or `b[k]` when moving to a position `j` or passing through a position `k`, and he will always choose the minimum to minimize his costs.
   - **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The list `suff` is created to store the suffix sums of `c`. Specifically, `suff[i]` is the sum of elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`. This allows us to quickly compute the total cost of moving through positions `j < k < i` in constant time.
   - **Finding the Minimum Cost**: The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity. The program then iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost of moving to each of these positions. The cost to move to position `i` is `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which includes the cost to move to position `i` and the cost to move through all positions from `i+1` to `n-1`. The minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.
   - **Output**: The minimum cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly initializes `c` with the minimum values of `a` and `b`.
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly computed to allow for efficient cost calculation.
   - The loop to find the minimum cost correctly considers all possible positions `i` from 0 to `k-1` and updates `ans` with the minimum cost.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
