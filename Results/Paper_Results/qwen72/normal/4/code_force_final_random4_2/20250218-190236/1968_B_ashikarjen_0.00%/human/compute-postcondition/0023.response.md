Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]` where `j` is increased by 1 and `j < m`.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `j`.
