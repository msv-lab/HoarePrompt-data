Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now less than or equal to `m`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
