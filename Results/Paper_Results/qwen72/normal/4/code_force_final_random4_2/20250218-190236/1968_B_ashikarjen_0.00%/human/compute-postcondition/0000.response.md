Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of test cases and the test cases themselves. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The integers `n` and `m` satisfy 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the total sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The binary strings `a` and `b` consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. `n` and `m` are now specific integers provided by the input.**
