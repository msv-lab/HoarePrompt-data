Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the grid for each test case, but it only counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. The program then checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. However, this approach does not correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Incorrect Output**: The program prints the list `k` instead of "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.
2. **Incomplete Shape Identification**: The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. A square will have all rows with the same number of '1's, while a triangle will have a specific pattern (either increasing or decreasing by 2).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Count the number of '1's in each row.
- Check if all rows have the same number of '1's to determine if it's a square.
- Check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of a triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2).

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
