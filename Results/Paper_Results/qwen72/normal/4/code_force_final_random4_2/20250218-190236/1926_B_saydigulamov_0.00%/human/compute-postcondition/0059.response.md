The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings. The integer `n` represents the size of the grid, and each string in the list contains `n` characters, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. The function returns a string indicating whether the shape in the grid is a "triangle" or a "square".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It returns "triangle" if the shape in the grid is a triangle, and "square" if the shape in the grid is a square.**
