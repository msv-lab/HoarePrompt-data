### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing a string of `n` characters (either '0' or '1').

2. **Shape Detection:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'.
   - For each row, it checks if the row contains '1'. If it does, it appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

3. **Shape Type Output:**
   - The program then checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints the list `k`.

### Issues:
- **Output Format:**
  - The program should print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
  - However, the program currently prints the list `k` instead of the shape type. This is incorrect.

- **Shape Type Determination:**
  - The program checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal to determine if the shape is a square.
  - This check is insufficient. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal, not just the first two.
  - For a triangle, the elements in `k` should form a sequence where each element is either 2 more or 2 less than the previous element (depending on whether the triangle is upright or upside-down).

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that properly determines the shape type and prints the correct output:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = []
        for _ in range(n):
            row = input()
            grid.append(row)
        
        k = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
        
        if len(k) < 2:
            print("TRIANGLE")
            continue
        
        if all(k[i] == k[0] for i in range(1, len(k))):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif all(k[i] == 2 * (i + 1) - 1 for i in range(len(k))) or all(k[i] == 2 * (len(k) - i) - 1 for i in range(len(k))):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("TRIANGLE")

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Grid Collection:**
  - The grid is collected into a list of strings `grid`.

- **Count of '1's:**
  - The list comprehension `[row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]` creates a list `k` containing the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'.

- **Shape Type Determination:**
  - If the length of `k` is less than 2, it must be a triangle (since a square or triangle must have at least 2 rows with '1's).
  - If all elements in `k` are equal, it is a square.
  - If the elements in `k` form a sequence where each element is either 2 more or 2 less than the previous element, it is a triangle.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it is a triangle (this is a fallback to handle any unexpected cases).

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not properly determine the shape type and does not print the correct output format.
- The corrected program correctly determines the shape type and prints the correct output format.

**Correctness: False**
