Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters for each input string that contains at least one '1', and `int(input())` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this condition is true.***
