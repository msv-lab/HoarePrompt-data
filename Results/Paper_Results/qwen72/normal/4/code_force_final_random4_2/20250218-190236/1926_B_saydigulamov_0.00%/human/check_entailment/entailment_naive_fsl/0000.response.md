Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly identify the shape drawn on the grid. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's and prints the list `k` if they do, which is not the correct output format and does not determine the shape. Additionally, it does not handle the cases where the shape is a triangle or an upside-down triangle. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
000
011
011
```

Expected Output:
```
SQUARE
```

Actual Output:
```
[2, 2]
```

The program should output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape, but it outputs a list of counts instead.
