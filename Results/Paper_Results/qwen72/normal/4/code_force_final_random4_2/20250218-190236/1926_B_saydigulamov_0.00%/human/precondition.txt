t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, representing the size of the grid. The grid is a list of n strings, each string containing n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
