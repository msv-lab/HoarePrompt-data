The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `a`, `i`, and `k` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since the task specifies that we need to adjust the state, we can ensure that the loop condition is met by specifying that the input must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
