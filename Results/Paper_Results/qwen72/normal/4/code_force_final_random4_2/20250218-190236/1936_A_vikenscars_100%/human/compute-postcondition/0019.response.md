Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`, and `ans1` is currently '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `pair_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `pair_idx`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_item_idx`, `ans1`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `n`, `i`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans1` is still valid.
- The updated value of `pair_idx` is now 0.
