Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx` if `ans1` is neither '<' nor '=', otherwise `pair_idx` is set to 0 if `ans1` is '<' or if `ans1` is '=' and `ans2` is '>', `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans2` is updated to the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_item_idx`, `ans1`, `pair_idx`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `ans1` and `pair_idx` are not altered by this code snippet, so their conditions remain as stated in the initial state.
