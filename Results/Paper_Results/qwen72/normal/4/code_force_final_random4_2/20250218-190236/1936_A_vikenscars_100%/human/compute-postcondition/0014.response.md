Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, and `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially, an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The variable `max_item_idx` will be the index `i` for which the function `func_1` returned the string '<' for the last time during the loop execution. If `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop, `max_item_idx` will remain 0.
