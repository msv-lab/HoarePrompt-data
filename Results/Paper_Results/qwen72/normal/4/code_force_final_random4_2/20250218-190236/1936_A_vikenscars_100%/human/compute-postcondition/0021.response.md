Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 0)`, and `ans1` is equal to '='.**
