Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is increased by 1, and `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2. Specifically, if `i` was less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` was not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` was not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `n`.***
