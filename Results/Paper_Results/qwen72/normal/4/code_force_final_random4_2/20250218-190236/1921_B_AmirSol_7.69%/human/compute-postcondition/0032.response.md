The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat. The function returns the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, with an additional consideration for consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` that are also different from each other in `s1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. It returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, including an additional count for consecutive differing characters in `s1` and `s2` that are also different from each other in `s1`.**
