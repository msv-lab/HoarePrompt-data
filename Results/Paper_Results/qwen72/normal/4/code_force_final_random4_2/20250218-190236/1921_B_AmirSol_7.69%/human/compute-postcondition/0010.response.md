Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1, and the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is different from `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is 2, the characters at index `i - 2` in `s1` and `s2` are different, and the character at index `i - 2` in `s1` is different from the character at index `i - 1` in `s1`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is equal to `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`.***
