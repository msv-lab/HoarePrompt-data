Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0, and the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different. Additionally, `i` is less than `n - 1`, the characters at index `i + 1` in `s1` and `s2` are different, and the character at index `i` in `s1` is different from the character at index `i + 1` in `s1`.**
