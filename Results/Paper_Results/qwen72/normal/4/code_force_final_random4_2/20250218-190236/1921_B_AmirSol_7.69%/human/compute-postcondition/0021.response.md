Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If `s1[i]` != `s2[i]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `i` < `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` != `s2[i + 1]` and (`s1[i]` != `s1[i + 1]`), then `i` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i]` == `s2[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `n`.***
