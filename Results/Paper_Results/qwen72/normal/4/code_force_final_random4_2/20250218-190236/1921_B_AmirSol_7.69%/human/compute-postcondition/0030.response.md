Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The loop has finished executing, so `i` is equal to `n`. The `counter` variable contains the total number of times a character in `s1` was different from the corresponding character in `s2`, considering the special case where consecutive different characters in `s1` and `s2` are also different from each other in `s1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed its execution, the index `i` has reached the end of the strings `s1` and `s2`, which is `n`. The `counter` variable now holds the count of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with an additional rule: if two consecutive characters in `s1` and `s2` are different and also different from each other in `s1`, they are counted as a single difference. This ensures that the `counter` reflects the number of "unique" differences between the two strings, taking into account the special case of consecutive differences.
