Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `L` is a list of integers.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is the length of the updated `N`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `k` is equal to `L[2]`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

### Conditions:
1. If `n * m == k`, then:
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

2. Otherwise:
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
   - `w` is the last element of the updated `N`.
   - `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`.
   - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`:**
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.

2. **Calculate `q`:**
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

3. **Determine `n`:**
   - `n` is the length of the updated `N`.

4. **Check the condition `n * m == k`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then:
     - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

   - Otherwise:
     - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of the updated `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Output Calculation:
- **Case 1: `n * m == k`**
  - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
  - `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

- **Case 2: `n * m != k`**
  - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
  - `w` is the last element of the updated `N`.
  - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
  - `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cost` based on the conditions described.

### Final Output:
Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions provided in the initial state)**
