Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to `L[0]`, `m` is equal to `L[1]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the updated `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
- The lists `L` and `M` remain as they were initially provided by the user input.
- The variable `q` is still the ceiling of `k / m`.
- The conditions for updating `N` and `cost` remain the same as described in the initial state.
