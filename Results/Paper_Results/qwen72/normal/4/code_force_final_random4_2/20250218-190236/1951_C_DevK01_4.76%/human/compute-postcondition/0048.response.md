Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`, `cost` is now equal to `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is the number of elements in `N`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `k`, `m`, `q`, `N`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
