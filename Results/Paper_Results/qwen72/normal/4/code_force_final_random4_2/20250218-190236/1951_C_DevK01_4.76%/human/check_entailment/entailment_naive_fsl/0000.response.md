Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is in the calculation of the cost when the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`). The logic for calculating the cost in such cases is flawed.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
27
```

**Actual Output:**
```
33
```

**Explanation:**
- The prices are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- We need to buy 7 tickets, and we can buy at most 2 tickets per day.

One optimal way to buy 7 tickets is:
1. Buy 2 tickets on day 1 with cost 2. Prices for the remaining days are [3, 4, 5, 6].
2. Buy 2 tickets on day 2 with cost 6. Prices for the remaining days are [5, 6, 7].
3. Buy 2 tickets on day 3 with cost 10. Prices for the remaining days are [7, 8].
4. Buy 1 ticket on day 4 with cost 7.

Total cost = 2 + 6 + 10 + 7 = 25.

However, the program outputs 33, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the cost when the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of `m`. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining tickets (`mu`) and the subsequent price increases is not correct.
