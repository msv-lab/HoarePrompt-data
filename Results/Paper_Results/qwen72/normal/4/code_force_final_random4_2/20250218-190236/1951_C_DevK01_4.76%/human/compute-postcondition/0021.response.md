The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `_` is 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the next iteration, `_` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the updated `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the updated `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
