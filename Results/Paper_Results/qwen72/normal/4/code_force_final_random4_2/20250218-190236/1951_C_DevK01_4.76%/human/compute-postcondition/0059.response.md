Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line contains a list of `n` integers `a`, representing the price per ticket for each of the `n` days. The function calculates the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day. It prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes. **
