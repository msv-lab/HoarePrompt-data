Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list of integers. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, and `cost` is equal to `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `w` is the last element of the updated `N` and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables.
- The initial state remains the same, with the only difference being that the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `k`, `m`, `q`, `N`, `n`, and `cost` are not modified by the `continue` statement.
- The program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop, if it is inside a loop.
