Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed and does not account for the dynamic changes in ticket prices after each purchase. Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the effect of purchasing tickets on subsequent days, where the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on previous days.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost by sorting the prices and then selecting the first `q` days to buy tickets. However, it does not correctly handle the dynamic price increase after each purchase.
   - The formula used to calculate the cost does not reflect the problem's requirement that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on previous days.

2. **Handling of Ticket Purchases**:
   - The program does not simulate the process of buying tickets day by day and updating the prices accordingly. Instead, it tries to use a mathematical formula that does not capture the dynamic nature of the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is very large or when `m` is very small compared to `n`.

A correct approach would involve simulating the process of buying tickets day by day, keeping track of the number of tickets bought and updating the prices accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def min_cost_to_buy_tickets(t, cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = cases[_][0]
        prices = cases[_][1]
        prices = [p for p in prices]  # Make a copy to avoid modifying the original list
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        while tickets_bought < k:
            # Buy as many tickets as possible from the cheapest day
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            cheapest_price = heapq.heappop(prices)
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * cheapest_price
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Update the prices for the remaining days
            for i in range(len(prices)):
                prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Re-heapify the prices to maintain the heap property
            heapq.heapify(prices)
        
        results.append(total_cost)
    
    return results

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cases.append(((n, m, k), prices))
    
    results = min_cost_to_buy_tickets(t, cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day and updates the prices dynamically after each purchase. This approach ensures that the total cost is minimized while respecting the constraints of the problem.
