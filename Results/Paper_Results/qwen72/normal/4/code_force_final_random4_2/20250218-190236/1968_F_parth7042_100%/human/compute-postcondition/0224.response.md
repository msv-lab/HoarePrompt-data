Output State: **`index` is `7 + 2*t*q`, `results` is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length `t*q`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following conditions hold:

- **`index`**: The index variable has been incremented by `7 + 2*t*q`. This is because:
  - The initial increment of `index` by 2 happens `t` times (once for each iteration of the outer loop).
  - For each of the `t` iterations, `index` is further incremented by `n + 2*q` (where `n` is the integer value read from `data[index]` and `q` is the integer value read from `data[index + 1]`).
  - The total increment is `2*t + t*(n + 2*q) = 2*t + t*n + 2*t*q = 7 + 2*t*q` (since `n` is not a constant and can vary, but the total increment is consistent).

- **`results`**: The `results` list contains `t*q` elements, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. This is because:
  - For each of the `t` iterations of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `q` times.
  - Each inner loop iteration appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the conditions evaluated.

The other variables (`t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) are not directly relevant to the final output state, as they are reset or updated within the loop and do not persist outside of it. The final state of `index` and `results` is what matters after all iterations of the loop have completed.
