Output State: **`index` is `10 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `a[2]` which is `int(data[8 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, and `a[3]` which is `int(data[9 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `pf[1]` which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, and `pf[3]` which is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` contains the list `[1, 1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` contains the list `[2]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- Given `i` is 3, `pf[3]` is set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
