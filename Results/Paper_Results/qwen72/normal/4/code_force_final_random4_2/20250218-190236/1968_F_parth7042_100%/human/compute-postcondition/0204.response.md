Output State: **`v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 1, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 4`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[r]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, and the last element of `results` is 'YES' if `x` is 0, otherwise the last element of `results` remains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `it2` to `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
- `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, so `it2` is now the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
