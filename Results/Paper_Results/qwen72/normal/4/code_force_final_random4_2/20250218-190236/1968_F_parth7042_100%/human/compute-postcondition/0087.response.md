Output State: **`index` is `5 + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `a[1]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary (defaultdict) where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `_` is `q`, `q` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q + 1]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2*q]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `a[1]`.
- The value of `index` is `5 + 2*q`, so `a[1]` is assigned the value `int(data[5 + 2*q])`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
