### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique to optimize input reading for large inputs.
   - The index variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The program processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.

3. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n + 1`.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is built such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - The dictionary `mp` is updated to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part has a XOR of 0, which is an interesting array. The program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there is a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values. It does this by:
     - Finding the first index `v1[it1]` in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l`.
     - Finding the last index `v2[it2]` in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
     - If `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, it means there is a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR array and uses it to efficiently answer the queries.
- The use of the dictionary `mp` to store indices of prefix XOR values allows for quick lookups and checks.
- The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct. If the XOR of the subarray is 0, it is trivially interesting. If not, the program checks if there are indices that allow for a valid split.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
