Output State: **`_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`. If `x` is 0, `results` is a list with the last element being 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**

Explanation: The variable `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, which finds the position in the sorted list `v1` where `l` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for `x` being 0 and the state of `results` remain as specified in the initial state.
