Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is `5 + 2*q + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is `7 + 2*q + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + n])`, `r` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + n + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices where `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices where `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element less than `r` is found. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then `results` contains the string `'YES'`. Otherwise, `results` contains the string `'NO'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is `9 + 2*(q - 1) + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*(q - 1) + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is `int(data[7 + 2*(q - 1) + n])`, `r` is `int(data[7 + 2*(q - 1) + n + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices where `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices where `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element less than `r` is found, `results` contains the string `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`. Otherwise, `results` contains the string `'NO'`. If `x` is 0, `results` now contains an additional string `'YES'`. `it2` is now `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, the string `'YES'` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, the string `'NO'` is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is `11 + 2*(q - 1) + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*(q - 1) + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `l` is `int(data[9 + 2*(q - 1) + n])`, `r` is `int(data[10 + 2*(q - 1) + n])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices where `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices where `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is found, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element less than `r` is found, `results` contains the string `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`. If `x` is 0, `results` contains an additional string `'YES'`. `it2` is now `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. `_` is 2. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, `results` contains an additional string `'YES'`. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional string `'NO'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
