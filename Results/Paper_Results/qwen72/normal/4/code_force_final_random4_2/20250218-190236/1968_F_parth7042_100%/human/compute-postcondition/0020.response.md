Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `index` is `index + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other conditions remain the same: `a[i]` is still updated to the integer value of `data[index]` (with the new `index`), `pf[i]` is still updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is still appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is still incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.
