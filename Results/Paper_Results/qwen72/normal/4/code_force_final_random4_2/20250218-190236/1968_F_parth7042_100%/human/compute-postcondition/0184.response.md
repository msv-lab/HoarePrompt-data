Output State: **`_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`. If `x` is 0, `results` is a list with the last element being 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`.
- The values of `_`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- If `x` is 0, the `results` list still has the last element as 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain valid.
