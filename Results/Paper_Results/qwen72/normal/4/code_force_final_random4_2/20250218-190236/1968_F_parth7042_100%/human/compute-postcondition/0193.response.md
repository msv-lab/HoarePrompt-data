The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute one more time if `_` is less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be 1, and `q` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 1, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then the last element of `results` is 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
