The code snippet `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is a list with the last element being 'NO', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Additionally, either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`.**
