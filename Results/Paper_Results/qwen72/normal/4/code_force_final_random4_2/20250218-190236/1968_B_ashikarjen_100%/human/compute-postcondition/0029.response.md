Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is increased by 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `m + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged. Since `j` was initially less than `m`, after incrementing, `j` is now less than or equal to `m`. The value of `k` is still increased by 1, and the condition that `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]` remains valid.
