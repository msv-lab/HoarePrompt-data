Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` is `j + x` where `x` is the number of times the loop executed, and `b[j + x - 1]` must not be equal to `a[2]` for all `x` such that `j + x - 1 < m`. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and the only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
