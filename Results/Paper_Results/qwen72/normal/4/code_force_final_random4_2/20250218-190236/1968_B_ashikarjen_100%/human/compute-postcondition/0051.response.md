Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from the user, consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. The function then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`. It calculates the number of matches (`k`) between the characters of `a` and `b` by iterating through `a` and finding corresponding characters in `b`. The function prints the number of matches found (`k`) and does not return any value. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the code provided does not include the loop to process these test cases. **
