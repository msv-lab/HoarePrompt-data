Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 2`, `j` must be less than `m`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `j` is `j + 1`, after the code execution, `j` becomes `j + 2`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
