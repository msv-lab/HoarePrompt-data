Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is the smallest index in `b` such that `b[j]` matches `a[i]` for the last `i` where `b[j] == a[i]` and `j < m`, or `j` is `m` if no such match is found. `k` is the number of matches found between `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop did not break early due to `j` reaching `m`.
- The variable `j` will be the smallest index in `b` where `b[j]` matches `a[i]` for the last valid `i` where `j < m`. If no such match is found, `j` will be `m`.
- The variable `k` will be the total number of matches found between the elements of `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`. If the loop breaks early because `j` reaches `m`, `k` will be the number of matches found until that point.
