Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a user-provided binary string, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a user-provided input, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, `j` remains `m` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, then `j` remains `m` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` is not equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, and `j` is `j + x` where `x` is the number of times the loop executed. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `b[j + x]` is not equal to `a[2]` for all `x` such that `j + x < m`, and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, `b[j + x - 1]` is not equal to `a[2]` for all `x` such that `j + x - 1 < m`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
