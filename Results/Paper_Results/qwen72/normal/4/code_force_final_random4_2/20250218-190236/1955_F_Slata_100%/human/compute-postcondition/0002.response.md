Let's break down the `print` statement step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are input integers, each greater than 0.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`: This is the sum of the remainders when `a`, `b`, and `c` are divided by 2.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This converts the boolean result of the condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` to an integer (1 if true, 0 if false).

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 equals 3. If it does, it adds 1 to the sum; otherwise, it adds 0.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 equals 3, or 0 otherwise.

Output: **a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3) (where a, b, c, and d are input integers each greater than 0)**
