The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the input integer that determines the range for the loop. Let's break down the adjustments step by step:

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. In a `for` loop, `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

2. **Input Integer**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the input integer. The input integer is provided by `int(input())`, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, the input integer must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are input integers, each greater than 0, and the input integer for the loop must be greater than 1**.
