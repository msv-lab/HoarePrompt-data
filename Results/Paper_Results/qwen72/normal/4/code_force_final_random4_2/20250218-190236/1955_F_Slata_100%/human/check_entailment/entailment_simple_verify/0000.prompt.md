You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers, each greater than 0, and the loop has executed `t` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the number of pairs of each number that can be removed and adds a condition for when the sum of the remainders of the counts of ones, twos, and threes is 3. However, this approach does not consider the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

A correct approach would involve understanding that Bob wins when the XOR of the sequence is zero. The XOR of a sequence of numbers can be analyzed based on the parity of the counts of each number. For example, the XOR of an even number of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s is zero, and the XOR of an odd number of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s is the number itself.

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible. The correct logic involves checking the parity of the counts and removing numbers accordingly.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 0 0 0`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Actual Output: `0`

However, the program fails in more complex cases:
- Input: `2 2 2 2`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Actual Output: `4`

The program correctly outputs 4 in this case, but it fails in other cases:
- Input: `1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `1`

In the last example, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to handle the XOR properties and the optimal removal strategy.
