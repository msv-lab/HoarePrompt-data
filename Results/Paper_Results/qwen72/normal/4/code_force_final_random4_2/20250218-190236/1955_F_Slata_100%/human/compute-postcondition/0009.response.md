Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers, each greater than 0, and the loop has executed `t` times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was in the initial state, being an integer between 1 and 10,000. The list `p_i` also remains unchanged, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, with each integer in the list between 0 and 200. The loop counter `i` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers for the last iteration, each greater than 0.
