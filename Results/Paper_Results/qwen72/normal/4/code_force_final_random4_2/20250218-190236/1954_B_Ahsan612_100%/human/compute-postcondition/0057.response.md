To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(ar)`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2 if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3.
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is 2, then `len(ar)` must be greater than 2.
- If `i` is 3, then `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.

Since `ar` is guaranteed to have at least 2 elements, the condition `i < len(ar)` will be satisfied if `i` is 2. However, if `i` is 3, we need `len(ar)` to be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Given that `i` can be either 2 or 3, the only way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3. `num` is the first integer in `ar` if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`. `same` is 2 if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1. `minn` is `inf` if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1. `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.**
