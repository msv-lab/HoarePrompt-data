Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 4, and `minn` is `inf`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 5, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 3, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 6, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 5, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and `ar[1]` is not equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 6, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
