The loop head in the provided for loop is `_ in range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer input by the user. The only object that can be adjusted in the loop head is the range, which is determined by the user input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider how the loop head will change for the next iteration. However, the range of the loop is defined by `int(input())`, which is an external input and does not change based on the internal state of the variables. Therefore, the loop will execute a fixed number of times as determined by the user input, and the state of the loop head does not change from iteration to iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the loop counter `_`, which is not explicitly tracked and is not relevant to the state outside the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, and `same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. If `minn` is either `inf` or `len(ar)`, `minn` is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.**
