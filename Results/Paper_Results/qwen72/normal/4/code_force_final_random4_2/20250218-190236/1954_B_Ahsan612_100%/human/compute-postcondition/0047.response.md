To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
while i < len(ar):
```

The loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of `ar`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `i` is 1
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `ar` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`**
