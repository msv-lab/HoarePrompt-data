Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `ar` to a new list of integers input by the user.
- The length of `ar` is now `i`, which is the number of elements in the new `ar`.
- The last integer in `ar` is now `num`.
- The count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar` is now `same`.
- The minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` is now `minn`.

All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
