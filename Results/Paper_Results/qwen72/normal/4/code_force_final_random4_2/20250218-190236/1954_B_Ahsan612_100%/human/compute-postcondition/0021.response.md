Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is either 1 or 2), `len(ar)` is greater than 1, `num` is equal to `ar[3]` if `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`, or `num` remains equal to the first element of `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`.**

In simpler terms:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 3 · 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of integers of length `n` with each element between 1 and `n`, and it is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `ar` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` remains 3.
- `minn` is now the minimum of the previous `minn` (which was infinity) and `same` (which is either 1 or 2). Since `minn` was initially infinity, `minn` will now be either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `same`.
- `len(ar)` remains greater than 1.
- `num` is updated to `ar[3]` if `ar[1]` is not equal to the first element of `ar`. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `num` remains equal to the first element of `ar`.
