Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. If `minn` is `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, then `minn` is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the following conditions hold:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.
