Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the program's handling of arrays of length 1. However, this is not the only issue present in the program. Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated version to understand its behavior and correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Variables Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to keep track of the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of the same element.
   - `i` is initialized to 1, which will be used to iterate through the array starting from the second element.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` by 1.
     - Updates `num` to the next element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1.

4. **Final Update and Output:**
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - The program checks if `minn` is `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful). Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Array of Length 1:**
   - The program does not handle arrays of length 1 correctly. For an array of length 1, the output should be `-1` because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
   - The program will incorrectly output `1` for an array of length 1.

2. **Incorrect Update of `i` and `num`:**
   - When the current element `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, the program increments `i` by 1 and then updates `num` to `ar[i]`. This can lead to an index out of range error if `i` becomes equal to `len(ar)`.
   - The correct approach should be to update `num` to `ar[i]` and then increment `i` by 1.

3. **Handling of Consecutive Segments:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments of consecutive elements. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will incorrectly output `1` instead of `1` (which is correct but for the wrong reason).

### Corrected Program:
To address the issues, we need to:
- Handle the case where the array length is 1.
- Correctly update `i` and `num` to avoid index out of range errors.
- Ensure the logic for finding the minimum segment length is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue with arrays of length 1. However, there are additional issues with the program that need to be addressed. The corrected program handles all edge cases and correctly finds the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Final: **False**
