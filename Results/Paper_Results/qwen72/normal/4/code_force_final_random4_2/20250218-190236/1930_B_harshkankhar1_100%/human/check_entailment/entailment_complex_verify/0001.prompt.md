You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should take a single integer `n` as an argument, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1, n (if n is odd)] or [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., n-1 (if n is even)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. It generates a list of integers from 1 to `n` and then reverses the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing). Finally, it prints the modified list in a single line, separated by spaces. The printed list alternates between the highest and lowest remaining values, starting with the highest. If `n` is odd, the list ends with 1; if `n` is even, it ends with `n-1`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and generates a list \( a \) containing the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list \( a \).
   - Finally, it prints the elements of the list \( a \).

3. **Permutation Generation:**
   - The list \( a \) is initially a simple permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - Reversing the elements at even indices (0-based) means that the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed in their order.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The key is to ensure that the generated permutation \( p \) does not have the property where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for any \( i \neq j \).
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the relative order of elements at even and odd indices is changed, which helps in breaking the divisibility condition.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - Initial list: \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \)
     - After reversing even indices: \( [4, 2, 3, 1] \)
     - This permutation is valid because:
       - \( 4 \) does not divide \( 3 \)
       - \( 2 \) does not divide \( 1 \)
       - \( 3 \) does not divide \( 4 \)
       - \( 1 \) does not divide \( 2 \)
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - Initial list: \( [1, 2, 3] \)
     - After reversing even indices: \( [3, 2, 1] \)
     - This permutation is valid because:
       - \( 3 \) does not divide \( 1 \)
       - \( 2 \) does not divide \( 2 \)
       - \( 1 \) does not divide \( 3 \)

6. **General Case:**
   - The program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the permutation is valid for any \( n \geq 3 \). This is because the relative positions of elements are altered in such a way that the divisibility condition is unlikely to be satisfied for any pair \( (i, j) \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the reasoning, the program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
