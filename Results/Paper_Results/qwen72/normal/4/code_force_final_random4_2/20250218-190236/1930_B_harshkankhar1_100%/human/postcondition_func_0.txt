The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. It generates a list of integers from 1 to `n` and then reverses the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing). Finally, it prints the modified list in a single line, separated by spaces. The printed list alternates between the highest and lowest remaining values, starting with the highest. If `n` is odd, the list ends with 1; if `n` is even, it ends with `n-1`. The function does not return any value.
