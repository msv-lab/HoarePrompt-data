### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes three variables: `i` to track the current position in string `a`, `j` to track the current position in string `b`, and `c` to count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Finding the Subsequence:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings `a` and `b` until either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1` to find the index of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not `-1`), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (where `new_j` is the index found by `func_1`), increments `i` by 1, and increments `c` by 1.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means the character `a[i]` is not found in the remaining part of `b`, and the loop breaks.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the strings `a` and `b`, and the current indices `i` and `j`.
   - It uses the `find` method to locate the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character in `b` (adjusted by adding `j`).
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which represents the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `a[0] = '1'`, `b[0] = '1'` → `new_j = 0`, `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`
  - `a[1] = '0'`, `b[1] = '1'` → `new_j = 3`, `j = 4`, `i = 2`, `c = 2`
  - `a[2] = '0'`, `j = 4` (end of `b`) → loop breaks
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `a[0] = '1'`, `b[0] = '1'` → `new_j = 0`, `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`
  - `a[1] = '0'`, `b[1] = '1'` → `new_j = 2`, `j = 3`, `i = 2`, `c = 2`
  - `a[2] = '0'`, `j = 3` (end of `b`) → loop breaks
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `a[0] = '1'`, `b[0] = '1'` → `new_j = 0`, `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`
  - `i = 1` (end of `a`) → loop breaks
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `a[0] = '1'`, `b[0] = '1'` → `new_j = 0`, `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`
  - `a[1] = '0'`, `b[1] = '1'` → `new_j = -1` → loop breaks
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `a[0] = '1'`, `b[0] = '1'` → `new_j = 0`, `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`
  - `a[1] = '0'`, `b[1] = '1'` → `new_j = 2`, `j = 3`, `i = 2`, `c = 2`
  - `a[2] = '0'`, `b[3] = '1'` → `new_j = 4`, `j = 5`, `i = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `i = 3` (end of `a`) → loop breaks
  - Output: `3`

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `a[0] = '1'`, `b[0] = '0'` → `new_j = -1` → loop breaks
  - Output: `0`

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The logic for finding the subsequence is sound, and the function `func_1` is used appropriately to locate the required characters in `b`.
