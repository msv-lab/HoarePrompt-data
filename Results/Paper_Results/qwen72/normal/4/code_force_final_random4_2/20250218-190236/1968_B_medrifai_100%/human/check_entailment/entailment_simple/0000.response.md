### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and then reads the strings themselves.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes three variables:
   - `i` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the characters of string `a`.
   - `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the characters of string `b`.
   - `c` to 0, which will count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Main Loop**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings:
   - It calls `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the position of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it updates `j` to the next position after the found index, increments `i` to move to the next character in `a`, and increments `c` to count the matched character.
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it breaks the loop because it means that the current character `a[i]` cannot be found in `b` starting from index `j`, and thus the prefix of `a` up to `i` cannot be extended further.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` is responsible for finding the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`.
   - It uses the `find` method of strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring or -1 if the substring is not found.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index in `b` where the character is found, adjusted by `j`.
   - If the character is not found, it returns -1.

5. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character in `a` within `b`, and the main loop ensures that the prefix is extended as far as possible.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to handle all edge cases and constraints correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
