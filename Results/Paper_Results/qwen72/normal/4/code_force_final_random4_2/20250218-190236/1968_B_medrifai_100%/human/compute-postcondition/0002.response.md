Output State: **The program returns the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from index `j`.** 

This is calculated by adding the current value of `j` to the value of `index`, where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. Since `index` is not -1, it indicates that `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`.
