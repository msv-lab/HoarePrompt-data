Output State: **`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. The last element of `a` is 0.**
