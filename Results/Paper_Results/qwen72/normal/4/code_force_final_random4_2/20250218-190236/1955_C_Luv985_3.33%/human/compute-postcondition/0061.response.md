Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` must be less than `r`, `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Initially, `ans` could be 0, 1, or 2.
- After the increment, `ans` can be 1, 2, or 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
