Postcondition: ***`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi`. `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`. `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is 0 or `0 - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. `mi` is 0 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update. If `2 * mi <= k`, `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `0 - mi`, and `ans` is `ans + 1` or `ans + 2` depending on whether `a[l]` was 0. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `2 * mi > k`, `t` is 0 if `k` is even, otherwise `t` is 1. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
