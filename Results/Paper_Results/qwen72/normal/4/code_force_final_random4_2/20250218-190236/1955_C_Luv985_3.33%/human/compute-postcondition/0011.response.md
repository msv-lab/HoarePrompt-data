Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and values of `T`, `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `r` are still valid.
