Postcondition: ***The loop will continue to execute as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`. During each iteration, the minimum value `mi` between `a[l]` and `a[r]` is calculated. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` and `a[r]` are both decreased by `mi`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`. If `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks without changing `ans`. After all iterations, `l` will be equal to or greater than `r`, or `k` will be 0 or less. The final value of `ans` will be the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0 during the loop, and `a[l]` and `a[r]` will be the remaining values after the loop has finished. If `l == r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.***
