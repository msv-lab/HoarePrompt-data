Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` must be less than `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `k` is now `k - (mi * 2)`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is now 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
