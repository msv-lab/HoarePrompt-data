Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
