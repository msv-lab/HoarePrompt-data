Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from the first string from the input, `k` is an integer converted from the second string from the input, `a` is a list of integers converted from the list of strings from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` before the if-else block. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 2, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, the second-to-last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r]`) is also 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - (k % 2) - (k // 2)` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi`. `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`. `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is 0 or `0 - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. `mi` is 0 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update. If `2 * mi <= k`, `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `0 - mi`, and `ans` is `ans + 1` or `ans + 2` depending on whether `a[l]` was 0. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `2 * mi > k`, `t` is 0 if `k` is even, otherwise `t` is 1. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi` (and has been decreased by `2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`), `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is 0 or `0 - mi` (or `0 - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[l]` was 0), `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi` (or `a[r] - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` was not 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update. If `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `l` is updated to 2 or 3. If `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k` and `mi - (k % 2) - (k // 2) == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains undefined.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
