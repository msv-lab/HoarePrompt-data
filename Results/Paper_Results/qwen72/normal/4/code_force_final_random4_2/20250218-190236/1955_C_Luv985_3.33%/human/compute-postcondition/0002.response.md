The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is an input integer and `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, and `a` is a list of lists**
