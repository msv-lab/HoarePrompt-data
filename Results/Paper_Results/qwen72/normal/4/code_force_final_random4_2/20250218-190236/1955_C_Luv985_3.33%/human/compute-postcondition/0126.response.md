Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi` and has been decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is `0 - mi` or `0 - 2 * mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- If `r` was initially `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`.
- If `r` was initially `n - 2`, it is now `n - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
