Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases. The function should still take three parameters: `t`, a list of pairs `(n, k)`, and a list of lists `a`. The initial state conditions for `t`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop will continue to execute as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`. During each iteration, the minimum value `mi` between `a[l]` and `a[r]` is calculated. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` and `a[r]` are both decreased by `mi`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`. If `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks without changing `ans`. After all iterations, `l` will be equal to or greater than `r`, or `k` will be 0 or less. The final value of `ans` will be the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0 during the loop, and `a[l]` and `a[r]` will be the remaining values after the loop has finished. If `l == r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0 or less than the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` multiplied by 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left or `n` if all elements are zero, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right or `-1` if all elements are zero, and `ans` is the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0 or negative, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left or `n - 1` if all elements from the left are zero, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right or 0 if all elements from the right are zero, and `ans` is the count of elements in `a` that are zero or negative between the indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) after the loop has finished executing. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
