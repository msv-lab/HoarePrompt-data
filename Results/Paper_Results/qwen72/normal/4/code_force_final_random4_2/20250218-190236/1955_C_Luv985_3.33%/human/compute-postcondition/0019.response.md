Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0.**
