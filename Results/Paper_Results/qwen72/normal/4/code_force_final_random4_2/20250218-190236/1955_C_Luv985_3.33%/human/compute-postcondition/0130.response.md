Postcondition: ***`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is 0 or `0 - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains undefined.***
