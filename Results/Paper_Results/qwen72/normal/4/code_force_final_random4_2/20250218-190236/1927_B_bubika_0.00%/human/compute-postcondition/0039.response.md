Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` integers, `r` is a string that has been concatenated with the values of `a[x]` for each integer `i` in `s`, where `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. Each element in `b` corresponding to the integers in `s` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the integer in `s`, `t` is incremented by 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than `t`.**
