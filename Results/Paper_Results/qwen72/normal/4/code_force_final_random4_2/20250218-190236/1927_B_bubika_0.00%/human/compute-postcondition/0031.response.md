Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the second integer in the list `s`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]` (unchanged from the initial state)**

In natural language, the output state is: `s` remains a list of integers with at least 2 integers. `i` is still the second integer in the list `s`, and `x` is still the index of the second integer in the list `s`. The value of `b[x]` has been increased by 1, and `r` has been increased by the value of `a[x]`, which remains unchanged from the initial state.
