The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
