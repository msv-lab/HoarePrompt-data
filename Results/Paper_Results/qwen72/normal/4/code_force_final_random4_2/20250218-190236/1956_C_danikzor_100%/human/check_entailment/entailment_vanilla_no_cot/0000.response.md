Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Output of Maximum Sum:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is the correct approach for this problem.
   - For a matrix of size `n x n`, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values from 1 to `n` in each row and column. The formula correctly computes this sum.

2. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations.

3. **Type 1 and Type 2 Operations:**
   - The program performs `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations.
   - For each Type 1 operation, it sets the entire row `i` to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each Type 2 operation, it sets the entire column `i` to the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

4. **Correctness of Operations:**
   - The permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - By performing these operations, the matrix will be filled with the highest possible values, ensuring the maximum sum.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements: it first prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the description of each operation.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.
