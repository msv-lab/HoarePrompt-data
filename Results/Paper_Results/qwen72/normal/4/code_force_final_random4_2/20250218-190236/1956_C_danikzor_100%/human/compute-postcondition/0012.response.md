The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a single integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, representing the size of an n×n matrix. The function ensures that the number of operations used for each test case does not exceed 2n. However, the provided function signature does not explicitly show the input parameters or the return value. Assuming the function is intended to return some result based on the input `n`, we can infer the following:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It ensures that the number of operations used for each test case does not exceed 2n. The function returns a result based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
