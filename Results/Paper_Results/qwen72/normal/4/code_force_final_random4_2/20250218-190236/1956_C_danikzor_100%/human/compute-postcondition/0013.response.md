Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It prints two values: the first is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, and the second is `2 * n`. For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: the first line starts with `1`, followed by `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1` in reverse order. The second line starts with `2`, followed by `i`, and then the same sequence of integers from `n` down to `1` in reverse order. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`. **
