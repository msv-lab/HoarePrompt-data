The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
