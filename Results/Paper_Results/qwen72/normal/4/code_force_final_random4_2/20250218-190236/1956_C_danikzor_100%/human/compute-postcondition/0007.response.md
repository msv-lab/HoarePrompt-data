Let's break down the print statement step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is the variable `i`, which is explicitly given as 2.
   - The third argument is the result of the `range(n, 0, -1)` function, which generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and going down to 1 (inclusive) in steps of -1.

4. **Range Function:**
   - `range(n, 0, -1)` will produce a sequence of integers from `n` to 1.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the sequence will be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
   - If `n` is 2, the sequence will be `[2, 1]`.

5. **Unpacking the Range:**
   - The `*` before `range(n, 0, -1)` unpacks the sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - This means that each element of the sequence will be printed as a separate value.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The first value printed will be `2`.
   - The second value printed will be `i`, which is 2.
   - The subsequent values will be the elements of the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the sequence will always start from `n` and go down to 1. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2, 2, n, n-1, ..., 2, 1 (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from n down to 1)**
