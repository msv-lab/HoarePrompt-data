### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations (up to \( 2n \)).
   - The operations involve either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) sums to \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and there are \( n \) such permutations (one for each row and one for each column).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \).
   - This formula is incorrect. For \( n = 2 \), the correct sum should be \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \), but the program calculates \( 7 \).

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the incorrect maximum sum and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations, setting each row and each column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

5. **Operation Effectiveness**:
   - The operations performed by the program are valid and will fill the matrix with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both rows and columns.
   - However, the sum of the matrix elements after these operations is not the maximum possible sum, as the sum of each row and each column should be \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's formula for the maximum sum is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.
   - The operations themselves are valid but do not achieve the correct maximum sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix elements. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and the program's formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) does not match this expected sum. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
