Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is indeed \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because each row and each column can be filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), and since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum is \( n \) times the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

However, the program's operations for filling the matrix are correct. The program uses the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both row and column operations, which ensures that each row and each column contains all integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once. This is a valid way to achieve the maximum sum, but the sum calculation is wrong.

Let's break down the program's behavior:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - Prints the incorrect maximum sum using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \).
   - Prints the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - Performs a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - Performs a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

The operations ensure that each row and each column contains all integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, which is a valid way to maximize the sum. However, the sum calculation is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output for the maximum sum.

For example, when \( n = 2 \):
- The correct maximum sum is \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \).
- The program calculates the sum as \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation, even though the operations to fill the matrix are valid.

Final: **False**
