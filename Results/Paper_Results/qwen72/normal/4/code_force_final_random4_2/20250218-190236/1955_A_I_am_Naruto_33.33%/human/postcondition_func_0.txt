The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two values: `ans1` as `a * n` and `ans2` as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
