### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of yogurts) is greater than 1. This is necessary because the promotion only applies when buying two or more yogurts.
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints the price of one yogurt `a`, which is correct because there is no promotion to consider.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price `b` and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price `a`. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is even or odd by using the integer division `n // 2` and the modulus operator `n % 2`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case `2 5 9`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10` and `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`. The minimum is 9, which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15` and `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`. The minimum is 14, which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 11`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15` and `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`. The minimum is 15, which is correct.
   - For the test case `4 5 11`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20` and `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`. The minimum is 20, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the original assessment's reasoning and verification are correct.

Final: **True**
