Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq t\).
   - `a` and `b` are integers.
   - `ans2` is calculated as \( \text{ans2} = b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \).
   - If \( n > 1 \), `ans1` is calculated as \( \text{ans1} = a \times n \).
   - If \( n \leq 1 \), `ans1` retains its original value, which is not defined in the initial state.

2. **Understanding the Calculations**:
   - `ans2` is a combination of two parts:
     - \( b \times n // 2 \): This is the integer division of \( b \times n \) by 2.
     - \( a \times n \% 2 \): This is the remainder when \( a \times n \) is divided by 2.
   - `ans1` is only defined if \( n > 1 \). If \( n \leq 1 \), `ans1` is undefined.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If \( n \leq 1 \), `ans1` is undefined, so the `print` statement will only consider `ans2`.

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( n > 1 \)**:
     - `ans1` is defined as \( \text{ans1} = a \times n \).
     - `ans2` is defined as \( \text{ans2} = b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \).
     - The `print` statement will output the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - **Case 2: \( n \leq 1 \)**:
     - `ans1` is undefined.
     - The `print` statement will output `ans2`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If \( n > 1 \), the output will be the minimum of \( a \times n \) and \( b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \).
   - If \( n \leq 1 \), the output will be \( b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \).

Output: **min(ans1, ans2) (where ans1 is a * n if n > 1, and ans2 is b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
