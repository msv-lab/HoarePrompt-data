Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It takes the number of test cases and for each case, it calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying them individually at the regular price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying them in pairs at the promotional price (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`), and prints the minimum of the two. The logic handles the case where `n` is 1 separately, which is also correct as the promotional price does not apply.
