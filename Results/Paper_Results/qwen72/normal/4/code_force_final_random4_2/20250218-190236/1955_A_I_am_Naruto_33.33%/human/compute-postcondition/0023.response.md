Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input, where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`, and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` is printed. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, `a` is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged. For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input, and the loop performs the following operations:
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates `ans1` as `a * n` and `ans2` as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it simply prints the value of `a`. 

This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
