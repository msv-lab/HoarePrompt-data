Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1 or less, the only option is to buy a single yogurt at the regular price `a`. This is handled correctly by the `else` block, which prints `a`.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two potential costs:
   - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd) are bought at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

   The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The logic is sound because:
- `ans1` correctly calculates the total cost if no promotions are used.
- `ans2` correctly calculates the total cost if the maximum number of yogurts are bought using the promotion, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.
- The `min(ans1, ans2)` ensures that the least expensive option is chosen.

The provided example test cases also match the expected output:
- For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the minimum cost is `9` (using the promotion).
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the minimum cost is `14` (1 promotion + 1 regular).
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the minimum cost is `15` (all regular).
- For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the minimum cost is `20` (2 promotions).

Given the problem constraints and the example, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
