The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes an input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `i` is 0. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
