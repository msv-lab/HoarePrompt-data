The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameter `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index for the loop. The other parameters `n`, `k`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are necessary for the function to be correctly defined and used within the loop body.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0**
