Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`.
   - The maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(k - 1)`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `k` is an input integer.
   - The print statement will output the value of `k - 1`.
   - Since `k` is an input integer and no specific value is given for `k`, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
