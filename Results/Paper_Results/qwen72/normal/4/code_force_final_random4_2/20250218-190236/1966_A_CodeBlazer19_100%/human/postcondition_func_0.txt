The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the number of cards to exchange `k`, followed by a list of card numbers `c`. It then calculates the frequency of each unique card number in the list. If the maximum frequency of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints the total number of cards `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
