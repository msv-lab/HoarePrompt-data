To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`.
   - If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print(n)` statement is executed after the condition involving `p` and `k` is checked.
   - However, the condition itself does not affect the value of `n` directly. It only determines whether the condition is met or not.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is an input integer.

Since the value of `n` is provided as an input and is not modified by the condition, the output will be the value of `n` as it was input by the user.

Output: **n (where n is the input integer provided by the user)**
