#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be defined with parameters to accept the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, the number of cards to exchange `k`, and a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards. However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not include these parameters. A correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, k, c):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the number of cards to exchange `k`, followed by a list of card numbers `c`. It then calculates the frequency of each unique card number in the list. If the maximum frequency of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints the total number of cards `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
