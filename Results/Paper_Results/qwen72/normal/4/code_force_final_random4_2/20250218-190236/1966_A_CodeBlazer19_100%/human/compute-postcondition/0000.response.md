Output State: **The function should be defined with parameters to accept the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, the number of cards to exchange `k`, and a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards. However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not include these parameters. A correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, k, c):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.**
