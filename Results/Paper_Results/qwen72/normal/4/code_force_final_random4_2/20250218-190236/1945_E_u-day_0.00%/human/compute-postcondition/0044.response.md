Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters but internally calls `func_1` to get `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get `arr`. It searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1. The function does not return any value. **
