To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`. This condition must be true for the loop to proceed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n-1`
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`

The condition `low + 1 < high` simplifies to `1 < high`, which means `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Since `high` is `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 2, `high` is at least 1. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than 1. Given that `n` is greater than 2, `high` (which is `n-1`) will be at least 2, satisfying the condition `1 < high`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of the previous `mid` and the new value `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.**
