Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`), `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The loop starts with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to `n-1`. The set `st` is initially empty.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`, meaning it will stop when `low` and `high` are adjacent or the same.
- **Binary Search**: The loop performs a binary search on the list `arr` to find the position of `k` or the closest elements to `k`.
  - **Mid Calculation**: `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
  - **Set Update**: `mid` is added to the set `st` to keep track of the indices checked.
  - **Condition Check**: If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.
- **Final State**: After the loop finishes, `low` and `high` will be adjacent or the same, and they will point to the indices that are just before and just after `k` in the sorted list `arr`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `low` will be the index of the largest element less than or equal to `k`, and `high` will be the index of the smallest element greater than `k`. If `k` is not found, `low` will be the index of the largest element less than or equal to `k`, and `high` will be the index of the smallest element greater than `k` or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`.
- **Set `st`**: The set `st` will contain all the indices that were checked during the binary search process.

This final state ensures that the loop has narrowed down the search range to the smallest possible segment where `k` could be located, or to the segment immediately surrounding `k` if it is not found.
