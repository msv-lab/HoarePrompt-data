Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the input values for `n` and `k` as integers.
   - `func_2` reads the permutation `arr` as a list of integers.
   - These functions are used correctly to initialize `n`, `k`, and `arr` in `func_3`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - The function `func_3` searches for the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
   - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index of `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `arr` to find the correct position of `k`.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search range is reduced to a single element.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `mid`, otherwise `low` is updated to `mid`.
   - The set `st` is used to track the indices checked during the binary search, but it is not used in the logic, so it can be ignored for correctness.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low] == k`, the function prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, the function prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating a single swap is performed to move `k` to the correct position.

5. **Handling the Problem Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the fact that the permutation is not sorted and that at most 2 swaps are allowed.
   - The function ensures that `k` is found in the permutation and that the binary search is performed correctly.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is already at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`).
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is not found in the permutation, which should not happen as `k` is guaranteed to be in the permutation.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic:
- The function assumes that `k` will always be found in the permutation, and if `k` is not at `low`, it prints a swap of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
- This logic is correct if `k` is found in the permutation, but if `k` is not found (which should not happen according to the problem constraints), the function will still print a swap, which is incorrect.

Given the problem constraints and the assumption that `k` is always in the permutation, the function is correct. However, the function should handle the case where `pos` is `-1` (though this should not occur in valid inputs).

Correctness: **True**
