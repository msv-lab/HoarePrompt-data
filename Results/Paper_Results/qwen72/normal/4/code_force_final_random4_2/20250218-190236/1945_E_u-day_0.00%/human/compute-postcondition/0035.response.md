Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of the previous `mid` and the new value `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.***
