Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm needs to perform more than one swap to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search finds the correct position of `x`. The program only prints one swap, which is not sufficient for all cases as the problem description allows up to two swaps.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
1
1 2
```
This is incorrect because after performing the swap (1, 2), the permutation becomes `[3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6]`, and the binary search will not find `3` at the correct position. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
