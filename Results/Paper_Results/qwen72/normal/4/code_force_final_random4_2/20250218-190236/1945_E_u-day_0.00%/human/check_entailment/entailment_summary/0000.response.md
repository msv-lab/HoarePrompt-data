Reasoning:

The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation so that a binary search can find the target element `x` in the correct position. The binary search algorithm is defined as follows:
1. Initialize `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
2. While `r - l` is not 1:
   - Compute `m` as the midpoint of `l` and `r`.
   - If `p_m` is less than or equal to `x`, set `l` to `m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r` to `m`.
3. The search ends when `r - l` is 1, and `p_l` should be equal to `x`.

The function `func_3` is the main function that processes each test case. Here's a breakdown of its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the input for `n` and `k` (the length of the permutation and the target element).
   - `func_2` reads the permutation `arr` as a list of integers.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The function iterates through the permutation to find the index `pos` where `k` is located.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`.
   - It then simulates the binary search process, adjusting `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`.
   - The set `st` is used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap that will place `k` at the correct position for the binary search to find it.

However, there are a few issues with the function `func_3`:

- **Binary Search Initialization:**
  - The problem specifies that `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`, but `func_3` initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`. This discrepancy means that the binary search is not being performed over the correct range.

- **Binary Search Loop Condition:**
  - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct for the range `[0, n-1]`, but it should be `while high - low > 1` to match the problem's range `[1, n+1]`.

- **Output of Swap Indices:**
  - The function prints `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate the swap. This is correct if `low` and `pos` are 0-indexed, but the problem specifies 1-indexed positions. Therefore, the indices should be `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Given these issues, the function `func_3` does not correctly implement the binary search as specified in the problem. The initialization and loop conditions are incorrect, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **False**
