Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is an empty set.**
