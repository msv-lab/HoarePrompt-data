The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `arr[0]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 0. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
