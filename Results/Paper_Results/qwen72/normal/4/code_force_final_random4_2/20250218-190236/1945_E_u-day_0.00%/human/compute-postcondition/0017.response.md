Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is an empty set.**

Explanation:
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
