Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. `pos` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `pos` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
