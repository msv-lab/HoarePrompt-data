Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set, `extra` is a set containing the integer `a[0]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` and any other elements it previously had, and `extra` remains an empty set. If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` remains an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing the integers `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `a[j]` is no longer in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` and any other elements it previously had, and `extra` remains an empty set. If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` remains an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing the integers `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
