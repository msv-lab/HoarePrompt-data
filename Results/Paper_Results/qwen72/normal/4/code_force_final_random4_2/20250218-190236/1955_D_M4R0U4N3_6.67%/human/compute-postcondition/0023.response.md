Output State: **_ is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2. `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with any elements that were in `a` (i.e., `n`, `m`, and `k`) removed if they were present. `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it. `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` (i.e., `n`, `m`, and `k`) that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop has run `m` times, but since `a` only has 3 elements (`n`, `m`, and `k`), `j` will be 2 after the last iteration.
- The set `todo` will contain the original user input values minus any values that were in `a` (i.e., `n`, `m`, and `k`).
- The set `done` will contain `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were originally in `todo` and were removed from it.
- The set `extra` will contain `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`.
