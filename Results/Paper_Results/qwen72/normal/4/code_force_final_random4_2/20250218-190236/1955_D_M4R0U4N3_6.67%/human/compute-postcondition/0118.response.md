Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. `old` (which was `a[0]`) is removed from `extra`. If the previous `old` is in `done`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If the previous `old` is not in `done`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.**
