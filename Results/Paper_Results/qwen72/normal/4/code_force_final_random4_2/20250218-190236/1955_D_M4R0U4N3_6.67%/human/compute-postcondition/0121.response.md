Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old`, and `todo` contains `old`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, and if the previous `old` (which was `a[0]`) is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If the previous `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, the previous `old` remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.***
