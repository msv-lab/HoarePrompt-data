Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` is a list with `old` removed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `old` is `a[r - m]`, which is an element in the list `a`.
- The `remove` method is called on the list `extra` to remove the value of `old`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The list `extra` now no longer contains the value of `old`.
