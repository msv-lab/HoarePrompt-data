Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` contains the value `a[r]` in addition to its previous contents. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed. If `old` was in `done`, it is added to `todo` and removed from `done`. Otherwise, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged.**
