Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `old` is in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `old` is not in `done` anymore, `a[r]` remains in `todo` if it was already in `todo`, otherwise it remains in `extra`.**
