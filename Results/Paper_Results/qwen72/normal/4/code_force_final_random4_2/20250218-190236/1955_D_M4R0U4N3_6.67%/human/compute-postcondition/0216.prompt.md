Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers that were not in `a` and were not moved to `done`, `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, plus any other elements from `a` that were in `todo` and moved to `done` during the loop, `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, plus any other elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and added to `extra` during the loop. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k`. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) < k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution. The `todo` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were not in the initial `m` elements and were not added to `done` during the loop execution. The `done` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `done` during the loop execution. The `extra` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop execution but were not added to `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations, `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
