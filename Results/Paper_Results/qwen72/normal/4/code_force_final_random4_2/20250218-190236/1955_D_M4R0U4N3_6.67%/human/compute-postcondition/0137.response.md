Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `done`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done` but in `extra`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `old` is in `done` but not in `extra`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`. If `old` is not in `done` or `extra`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`. Additionally, `a[r]` is added to `done`.**
