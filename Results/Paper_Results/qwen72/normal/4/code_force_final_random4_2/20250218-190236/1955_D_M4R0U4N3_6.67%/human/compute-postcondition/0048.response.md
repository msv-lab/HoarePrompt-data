Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with any elements that were in `a` removed if they were present, plus `old` which is `a[r - m]`, `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, plus `a[r]` if it was in `todo`, but `a[r - m]` has been removed from it, `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, plus `a[r]` if it was not in `todo`, `r` is `r + 1`, `n` must be greater than `r + 1`, `ans` is 0 or 2 depending on the number of elements in `done` after `a[r - m]` has been removed, `old` is `a[r - m]` and has been added back to `todo`.**
