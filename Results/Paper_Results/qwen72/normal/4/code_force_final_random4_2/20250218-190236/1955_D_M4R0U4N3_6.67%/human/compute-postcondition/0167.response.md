Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- The variable `a` remains a list of integers, and `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values.
- The variable `r` is still `n`.
- The variable `old` is still `a[n - m]`.
- The variable `ans` is increased by the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.
- The loop index `j` is `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `m` iterations.
- The variable `m` is greater than or equal to 1, as the loop must have executed at least once.
- The set `todo` now contains the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed.
- The set `done` contains all elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations.
- The set `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations.
