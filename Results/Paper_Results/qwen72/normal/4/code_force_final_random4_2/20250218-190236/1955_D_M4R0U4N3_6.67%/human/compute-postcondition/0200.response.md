Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.***
