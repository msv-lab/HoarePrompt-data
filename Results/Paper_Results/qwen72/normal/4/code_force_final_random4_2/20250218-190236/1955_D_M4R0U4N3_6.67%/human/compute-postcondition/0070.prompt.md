Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with any elements that were in `a` removed if they were present, `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with any elements that were in `a` removed if they were present, `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, plus `a[r]` if it was in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, plus `a[r]` if it was not in `todo`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `n` must be greater than `r + 1`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is 1 or 3 depending on the number of elements in `done`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, `done` now contains `a[r]`, and the state of `extra` remains unchanged based on the presence of `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) in these sets. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains the value `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `old` is added back to `todo`, and `done` is updated accordingly. The state of `todo` and `extra` is adjusted based on the presence of `old` in these sets, but the overall structure and relationships between the variables remain consistent with the precondition. If `len(done) < k`, `ans` is 0 or 2 depending on the number of elements in `done`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, `done` now contains `a[r]`, and the state of `extra` remains unchanged based on the presence of `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) in these sets. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains the value `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `old` is added back to `todo`, and `done` is updated accordingly. The state of `todo` and `extra` is adjusted based on the presence of `old` in these sets, but the overall structure and relationships between the variables remain consistent with the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is 1. If `a[r]` is in the set `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to the set `done`. If `old` is in the list `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in the set `done`, `old` is added to the set `todo` and removed from the set `done`. Otherwise, if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to the list `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed. If `old` was in `done`, it is added to `todo` and removed from `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
