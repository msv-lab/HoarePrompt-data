Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing the integer `a[0]`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**

Explanation:
- The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the integer at index `0` of the list `a` to the set `extra`.
- Since `j` is `0`, `a[j]` is `a[0]`.
- The set `extra` was initially empty, so now it contains the integer `a[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
