Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.
- `r` is `r + 1`, so `r - m` is `r + 1 - m`.
- Since `r` is `r + 1` and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `r + 1 - m` will be a negative index.
- The list `a` contains the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, so `a[r - m]` will access an element in the list using a negative index.
- Negative indices in Python count from the end of the list, so `a[r - m]` will be the element at the position `r + 1 - m` from the end of the list.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The value of `old` is now `a[r - m]`.
