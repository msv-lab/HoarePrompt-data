Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the following conditions hold:**

- `_` is `t - 1` (indicating that the loop has run `t` times).
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are the input integers provided for the last iteration of the loop.
- `a` is the list of integers provided for the last iteration of the loop.
- `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input list `b` that were not found in the sliding window of size `m` in `a` and were not moved to `done`.
- `done` is a set containing the integers from the sliding window of size `m` in `a` that were found in `todo` and were moved from `todo` to `done`.
- `extra` is a set containing the integers from the sliding window of size `m` in `a` that were not in `todo` and were added to `extra`.
- `ans` is the total number of sliding window positions where the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

In natural language, the loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for the last test case, it has completed the sliding window algorithm. The `todo` set contains elements from `b` that were not found in the sliding window of `a`. The `done` set contains elements from the sliding window that were found in `todo` and moved to `done`. The `extra` set contains elements from the sliding window that were not in `todo`. The `ans` variable holds the count of how many times the sliding window had at least `k` elements in the `done` set.
