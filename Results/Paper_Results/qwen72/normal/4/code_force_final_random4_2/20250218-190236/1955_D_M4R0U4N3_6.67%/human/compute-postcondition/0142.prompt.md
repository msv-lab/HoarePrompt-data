Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is `m - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers from the new input that were not in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]`, `done` is a set of integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were initially in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not initially in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k` else `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, and if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done` but in `extra`, it remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `old` is in `done` but not in `extra`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, and `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `old` is removed from `extra` if `old` is in `extra`, and `a[r]` is added to `extra` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If `len(done) < k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
