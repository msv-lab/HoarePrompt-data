The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers.
- `r` is `n`.
- `old` is `a[n - m]`.
- `j` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- The current value of `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`.
- If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` and any other elements it previously had, and `extra` remains an empty set.
- If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` remains an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing the integers `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

After executing `extra.add(a[j])`:
- `extra` now contains the integers `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`.
- If `a[j]` was in `todo`, `extra` now contains `a[j]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` and any other elements it previously had if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the integers `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`.**
