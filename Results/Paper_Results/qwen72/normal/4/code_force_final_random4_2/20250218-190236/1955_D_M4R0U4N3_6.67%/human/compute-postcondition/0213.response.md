Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `old` is in `extra`, `a[m]` is removed from `extra`, and `done` is updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `a[m]` is added to `todo`, removed from `done`, and `done` and `extra` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `old` is neither in `extra` nor in `done`, `todo` and `done` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`, and `done` is updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `len(done) < k`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` are not evaluated.***
