Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. `old` is not in `done` anymore. If `old` was in `done` but not in `extra`, it is now in `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it remains in `todo`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it remains in `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.**
