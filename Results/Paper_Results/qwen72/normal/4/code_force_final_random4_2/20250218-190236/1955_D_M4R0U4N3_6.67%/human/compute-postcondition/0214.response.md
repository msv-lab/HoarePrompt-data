Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations, `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `r` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `old` will be the last element processed, which is `a[n - m]`.
- The set `todo` will contain any integers from the initial input that were not found in the list `a` during the loop iterations.
- The set `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were found in `todo` during the loop iterations.
- The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations.
- The variable `ans` will be the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
