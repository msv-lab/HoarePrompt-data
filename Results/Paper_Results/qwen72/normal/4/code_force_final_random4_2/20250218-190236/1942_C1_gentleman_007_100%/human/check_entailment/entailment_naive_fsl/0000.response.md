Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic that directly addresses the problem description. Specifically, there is no function or code that calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the vertices chosen by Bessie. The functions provided in the program seem to be unrelated to the problem, such as functions for generating prime numbers, performing binary search, and calculating greatest common divisors, which are not relevant to the task of forming triangles in a polygon. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the problem as described.
