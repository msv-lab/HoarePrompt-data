The function `func_18` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of the minimum and maximum values in `p`. It returns the index of the largest element in `p` that is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is less than the smallest element in `p`, it returns `-1`. The function does not modify the input list `p`.
