Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `j` is `len(b) - 1`. `l` is an empty list. Additionally, `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` changes from `len(b)` to `len(b) - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
