The function `func_12` accepts a positive integer `num` greater than 1 and a `Prime_array` (a list or dictionary where keys are integers and values are their smallest prime factors). It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of the original `num` and its value is the number of times that prime factor appears in the factorization of the original `num`. After the function concludes, `num` is 1, and `Prime_array` remains unchanged.
