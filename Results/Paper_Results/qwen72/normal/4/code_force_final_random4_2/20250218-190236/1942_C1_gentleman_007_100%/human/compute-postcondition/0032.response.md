The objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`. The loop will execute for each node in `graph[ver]`. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes, and `node` is the second node in `graph[ver]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next node in `graph[ver]` must be considered. This means `node` should now refer to the third node in `graph[ver]`, and `graph[ver]` must still contain at least three nodes for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`q` has one less element than before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes, `node` is the third node in `graph[ver]`**
