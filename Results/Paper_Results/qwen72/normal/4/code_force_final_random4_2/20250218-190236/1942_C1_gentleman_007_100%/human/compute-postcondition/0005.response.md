Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ver` is now the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`.
   - `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists (the exact structure is not specified, but it is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ver, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).
   - `ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q` before the leftmost element was removed.
   - Since `vis[ver]` is 1, it indicates that `ver` has been visited or processed in some way, but this does not affect the value of `ver` itself.

4. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `ver` is not provided, but it is known to be the value that was at the left end of the deque `q` before the removal.
   - The print statement will output this value followed by a space.

Output: **[ver] (where [ver] is the value that was at the left end of the deque `q` before the leftmost element was removed)**
