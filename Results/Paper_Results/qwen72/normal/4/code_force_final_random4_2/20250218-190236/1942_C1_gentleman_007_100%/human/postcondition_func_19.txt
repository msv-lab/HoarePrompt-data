The function `func_20` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the integer part of the square root of `x`. If `x` is 0 or 1, it returns `x`. For `x` greater than 1, it returns the largest integer `mid` such that `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x` and `(mid + 1) * (mid + 1)` is greater than `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged throughout the function.
