Output State: **`q` has no elements left, `ver` is the last element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, and all nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are now marked as visited in the `vis` list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The queue `q` is empty, as all elements that were initially in `q` have been processed.
- The variable `ver` holds the value of the last element that was at the front of `q` before the loop processed it.
- The `vis` list has been updated to mark all nodes that were initially in `q` and their neighbors (which were not already visited) as visited.
