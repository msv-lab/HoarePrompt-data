The function `func_21` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `mod`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `mod` is a positive integer. It performs modular exponentiation, calculating `a^b % mod`. The function returns the result of this modular exponentiation, which is an integer. After the function concludes, `a` is modified to be `(a^(2^iterations)) % mod`, `b` is 0, and `mod` remains unchanged.
