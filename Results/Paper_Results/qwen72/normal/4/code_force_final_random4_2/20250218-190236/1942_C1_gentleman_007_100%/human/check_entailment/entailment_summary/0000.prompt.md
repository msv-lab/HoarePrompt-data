Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, and returns an iterator that converts each split element into an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has an iterator over the integer values derived from the input string.

''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a value `v` of any type. It returns a list containing `n` elements, where each element is the value of `v`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` inner lists. Each inner list at index `x` and `y` (for each pair returned by `func_1()`) is appended with the corresponding `y` or `x` value, respectively. After the function concludes, the list `l` will have `n + 1` inner lists, and each of these inner lists will contain elements that represent the connections (edges) added between the vertices of the polygon. The final state of the program is that `l` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index.

 Output hints for function24:  The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `ver`, using an external adjacency list `graph` and a visited list `vis`. After the function concludes, all vertices reachable from `ver` that were not previously visited are marked as visited in `vis`, and their order of processing is printed to the console. The `stack` used for the DFS is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the updated visited status of all nodes.
Function number 25 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        print(ver, end=' ')
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
''' 

 Output hints for function25:  The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first traversal starting from the given vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It marks all reachable vertices from `ver` as visited in the `vis` list and prints each visited vertex. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `vis` list will have been updated to mark all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited, and the `q` deque will be empty.
