To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is a queue (or list) that has one fewer element at the front.
   - `ver` is the element that was second in `q` before the operation.
   - All nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are now marked as visited in the `vis` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ver, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `ver`.
   - `ver` is explicitly described as the element that was second in `q` before the operation.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `ver` is the element that was second in `q` before the operation, the `print` statement will output this value followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[ver] (where [ver] is the element that was second in `q` before the operation)**
