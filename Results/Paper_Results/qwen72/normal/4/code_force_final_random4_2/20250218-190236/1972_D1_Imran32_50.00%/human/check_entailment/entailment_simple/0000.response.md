### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates `root` as the integer part of the square root of \(n\) plus 1.
   - It iterates from \(i = 2\) to `root` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` should be `m` to match the problem statement.
   - **Logic Error**: The logic inside the loop and the final calculation of `ans` does not match the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program is performing a different calculation.
   - **Correct Calculation**: The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
   - The variable naming issue and the logic error in the calculation of `ans` make the program incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
