Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #State: `n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + Î£((`n` + i) // (i * i)) for i from 2 to `root`, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is `root` + 1, `cnt` is (`root` + 1) * (`root` + 1).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left( \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right) \) and root is the integer part of the square root of n plus 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer. It then calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of `n` and a series of terms derived from `n` and its square root. Specifically, `ans` is computed as `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each integer `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value.
