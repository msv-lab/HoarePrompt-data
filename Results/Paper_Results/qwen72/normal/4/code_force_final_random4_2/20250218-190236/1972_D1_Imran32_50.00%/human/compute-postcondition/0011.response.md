Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9 + (`n` + 4) // 16, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 4, `cnt` is 16**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9.
- The value of `i` is 4 and the value of `cnt` is 16.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9 + (`n` + 4) // 16.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `root`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
