Reasoning:

The annotated program is incorrect based on the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_1`:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are the integers provided in each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1` reads the input inside itself, which is not consistent with the expected behavior. It should receive `n` and `m` as arguments from the loop in the main part of the program.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The current logic in `func_1` does not implement this condition. Instead, it calculates a value `ans` using a different formula that is not related to the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses a formula that sums up terms derived from `n` and its square root, which is not relevant to the problem.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
