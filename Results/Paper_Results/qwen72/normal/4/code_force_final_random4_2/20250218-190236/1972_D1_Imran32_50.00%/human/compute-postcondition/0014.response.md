The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m` within the specified range and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and returns a value based on these inputs.**
