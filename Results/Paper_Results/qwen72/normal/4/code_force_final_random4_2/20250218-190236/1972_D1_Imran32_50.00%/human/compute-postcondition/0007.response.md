Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 3, `cnt` is 9**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `i * i`. Since `i` is 3, `cnt` becomes 9.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, `ans`, `root`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
