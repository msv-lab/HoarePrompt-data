Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + Î£((`n` + i) // (i * i)) for i from 2 to `root`, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is `root` + 1, `cnt` is (`root` + 1) * (`root` + 1).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:
- The variable `n` remains at least 1.
- The variable `k` remains an input integer.
- The variable `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- The variable `ans` is updated to be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the integer divisions of (`n` + i) by (i * i) for each integer `i` from 2 to `root`.
- The variable `root` remains the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1.
- The variable `i` is incremented to `root` + 1, which is the value immediately after the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `cnt` is set to the square of `root` + 1, which is the next value of `i * i` after the loop finishes.
