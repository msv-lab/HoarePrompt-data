The function `oacm` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function should process these inputs and return the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) for each test case.
