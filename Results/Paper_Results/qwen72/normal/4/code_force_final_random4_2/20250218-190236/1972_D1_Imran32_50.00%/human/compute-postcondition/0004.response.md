Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 4.**

The code snippet `cnt = i * i` calculates the value of `cnt` by squaring the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `cnt` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
