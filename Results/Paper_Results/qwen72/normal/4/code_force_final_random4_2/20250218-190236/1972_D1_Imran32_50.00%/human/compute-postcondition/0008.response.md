Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 3, `cnt` is 9**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to include the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt`.
- Since `i` is 3 and `cnt` is 9, the expression `(n + i) // cnt` simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`.
- The new value of `ans` is therefore `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `root`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
