Postcondition: ***`di` is the third element of `d[da]`, `d[da]` is a list of integers with a length greater than 2. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between the original `tmp` and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
