Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15()` is intended to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_15()`**:
   - The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is not appropriate for the problem. The condition `i * i <= n + i` does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of multiples, but it does not consider the gcd condition properly.

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program does not use the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is essential for the problem.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_16()` writes the result directly to `sys.stdout`, which is generally fine, but the program should ensure that the correct logic is used to generate the results.

A correct approach to solve the problem would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this approach would be too slow for the given constraints. A more efficient approach involves using number theory to reduce the complexity.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def main():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        sys.stdout.write(str(count_valid_pairs(n, m)) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version correctly implements the logic to count the valid pairs, but it is still inefficient for large inputs. A more optimized approach would be necessary to handle the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\). However, the provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.
