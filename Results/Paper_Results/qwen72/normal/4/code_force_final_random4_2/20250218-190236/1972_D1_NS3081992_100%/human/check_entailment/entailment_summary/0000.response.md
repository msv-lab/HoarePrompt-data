### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions:
     - `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
     - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `k` such that `k * k > n + k` or `k > m`.
   - For each `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - `func_16()` iterates `t` times, calling `func_15()` for each test case and printing the result to the console.

### Analysis of `func_15`:
- The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is equivalent to `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
- This can be rewritten as `a + b = k * b * d` where `d = gcd(a, b)`.
- Simplifying, we get `a + b = k * b * d`, which implies `a = (k * b * d - b) / d`.
- For `a` to be an integer, `k * b * d - b` must be divisible by `d`, which simplifies to `a = b * (k * d - 1) / d`.
- This means `a` must be a multiple of `b` and `d`.

### Correctness of `func_15`:
- The function `func_15` seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `i` and using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
- However, this formula does not directly correspond to the problem's condition. The formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` is not a correct way to count the pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition directly, or using a more efficient method to count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as described in the problem statement.
- Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
