The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, the result of `func_10()` must be a non-negative integer greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
