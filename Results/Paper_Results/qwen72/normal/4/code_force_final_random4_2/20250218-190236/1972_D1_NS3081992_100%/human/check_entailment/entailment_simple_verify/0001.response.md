### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a = b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
   - This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_15():**
     - This function is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
     - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and checks the condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
     - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) to the answer.
     - Finally, it returns \(ans - 1\).

4. **Correctness of func_15():**
   - The condition \(i \cdot i \le n + i\) ensures that \(i\) is a valid candidate for \(b\).
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end of the function is indeed incorrect. This subtraction does not align with the problem statement and can lead to undercounting the number of valid pairs.

5. **Function 16:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_15()` for each test case.
   - It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output.

6. **Overall Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_15()`.
   - The main logic is in `func_15()`, which is responsible for counting the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
- The logic in `func_15()` is almost correct, but the subtraction of 1 at the end is not justified by the problem statement. This could lead to incorrect results for some test cases.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect due to this issue.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
