Output State: **`func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console.** 

The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` prints the value of `func_15()` to the console and adds a newline character. The state of `func_10()` and `_` remains unchanged.
