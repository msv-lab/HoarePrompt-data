The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if the return value of `func_10()` is greater than the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 0, and `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a non-negative integer greater than 0, and the value of `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Since `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the loop depends on the return value of `func_10()`, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`func_10()` must return a non-negative integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
