Output State: **`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. If `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` and contains at least one character, `no` is False if any character in `c` is not found in `a` or `b`; otherwise, `no` remains True.**
