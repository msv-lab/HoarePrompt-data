Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string that must have at least one character. If `x` is not present in `a` and `b`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
