You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True

        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `tests - 1`, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, and all characters in `c` are found in `a` or `b`, then `no` is True. Otherwise, `no` is False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program has the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Template Matching**:
   - The program checks if any character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b` and immediately prints "YES" if such a character is found. This is incorrect because the template matching conditions are more complex than just checking for the presence of characters.
   - The correct approach should be to check for each position `i` in the strings if there exists a template character `t[i]` such that:
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template `t[i]` according to the rules.
     - `c[i]` does not match the template `t[i]` according to the rules.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the strings `a` and `b` are identical and `c` is different but still matches the template. For example, if `a = "abc"`, `b = "abc"`, and `c = "def"`, the program will incorrectly print "YES" because it only checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     abc
     abc
     def
     ```
     The program will output "YES" because it finds that 'd', 'e', and 'f' are not in `a` or `b`. However, the correct output should be "NO" because there is no template that `a` and `b` can match while `c` does not match it.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
