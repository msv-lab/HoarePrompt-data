You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it internally reads an integer n from the standard input, where n is the number of vertices in the tree and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. It also reads n - 1 lines from the standard input, each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v) representing an edge between vertices u and v. The input is assumed to form a valid tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the standard input and are now `u - (n - 1)` and `v - (n - 1)` respectively.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: The loop continues to append the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until `previous[path_ba[-1]]` is -1. At this point, the loop breaks. The final state of `path_ba` will contain the sequence of nodes from `b` to the starting node `a` in reverse order. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged. The values of `_`, `u`, and `v` are not affected by the loop and remain as `n - 2`, `u - (n - 1)`, and `v - (n - 1)` respectively.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` remains the middle index of `path_ba`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, and `ops` now includes the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, `path_ba` is a list with an even number of elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
    #State: *The loop has completed all iterations, and `i` is either `ci + 1` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, or the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1` if `len(path_ba)` is even. `ci` remains the middle index of `path_ba` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, and `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1` if `len(path_ba)` is even. `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. `ops` is a list that includes tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, or tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1` if `len(path_ba)` is even.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: `L // 2 + 1` if `L` is odd, or `L // 2` if `L` is even (where `L` is the length of `path_ba`)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: c + 1 0
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads a tree structure from the standard input, where the number of vertices `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^3, and `n - 1` edges are specified between the vertices. It processes this tree and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
