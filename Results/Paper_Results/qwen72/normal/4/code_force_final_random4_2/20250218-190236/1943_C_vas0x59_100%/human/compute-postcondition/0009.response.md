Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 1, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 1`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are updated to the new values read from the standard input.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains a specific integer greater than 2. The list `u2vs` still contains `n` lists, and the list at index `v` still contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents. The variable `_` remains 1. The variables `u` and `v` are updated to new values read from the standard input, and these new values are then each decremented by 1.
