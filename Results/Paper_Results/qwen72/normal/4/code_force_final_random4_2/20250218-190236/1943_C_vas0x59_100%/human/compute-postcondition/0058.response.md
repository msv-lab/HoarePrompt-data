Output State: **The loop continues to append the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until `previous[path_ba[-1]]` is -1. At this point, the loop breaks. The final state of `path_ba` will contain the sequence of nodes from `b` to the starting node `a` in reverse order. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged. The values of `_`, `u`, and `v` are not affected by the loop and remain as `n - 2`, `u - (n - 1)`, and `v - (n - 1)` respectively. `ops` is an empty list. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer since the length of `path_ba` is even). `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the value of `path_ba[ci1]`. `c2` is the value of `path_ba[ci2]`.**
