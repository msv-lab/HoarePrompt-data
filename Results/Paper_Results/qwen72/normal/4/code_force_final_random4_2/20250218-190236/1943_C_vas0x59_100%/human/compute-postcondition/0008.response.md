The only objects in the loop head are the placeholder variable `_` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute if `_` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, and `_` is a placeholder variable that is incremented by 1 each time the loop iterates.

Given that the loop has already executed at least once, `_` must have been incremented to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 1, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 1, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 1`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 1`**
