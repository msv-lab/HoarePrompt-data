Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` is `u - (n - 1)`, `v` is `v - (n - 1)`, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**

Explanation:
- The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling `func_1` with the argument `d` to the variable `b`.
- The value of `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`.
- The value of `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, which is also assigned to `b`.
- All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `_`, `u`, `v`, `a`, `previous`) remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects that `b` now holds the same value as `a`, which is the result of `func_1(d)`.
