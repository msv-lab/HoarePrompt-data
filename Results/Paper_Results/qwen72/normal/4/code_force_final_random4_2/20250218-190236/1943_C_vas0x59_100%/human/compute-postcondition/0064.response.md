Output State: **`i` is 3, `path_ba` is a list with at least 5 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- `path_ba` is still a list with at least 5 elements.
- `ci1` is still `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`.
- The list `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(c2, 3)`, making it a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`.
