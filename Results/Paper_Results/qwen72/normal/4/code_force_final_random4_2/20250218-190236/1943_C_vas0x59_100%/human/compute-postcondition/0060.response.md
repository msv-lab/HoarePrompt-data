Output State: **`i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci1, 1)`**. 

The code appends the tuple `(ci1, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1 and `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, the list `ops` now contains the tuple `(ci1, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
