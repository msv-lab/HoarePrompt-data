Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is an input integer, b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

The initial state specified that `a` was a binary string of length `n`. After executing the code snippet `a = int(input())`, `a` is now an integer that has been read from the input. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged.
