The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `a` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. The function then searches for the first occurrence of each character in `d` within the remaining part of `e` starting from the current index `k`. If a character in `d` is found in `e`, `k` is updated to the index of the found character plus one. If a character in `d` is not found in the remaining part of `e`, or if the end of `d` or `e` is reached, the function prints the current value of `k` and moves to the next test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes.
