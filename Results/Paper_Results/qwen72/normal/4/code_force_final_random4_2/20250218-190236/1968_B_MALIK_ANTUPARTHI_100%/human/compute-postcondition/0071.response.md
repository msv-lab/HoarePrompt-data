Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1, or `j + 1` if the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`.** 

The value of `d` is now assigned the input value provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
