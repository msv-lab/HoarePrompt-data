Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`.
- Since `j` is 2, `k` becomes 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
