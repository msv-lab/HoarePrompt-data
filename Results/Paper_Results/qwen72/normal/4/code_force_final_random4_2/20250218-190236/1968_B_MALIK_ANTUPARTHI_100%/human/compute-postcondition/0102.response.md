To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the precondition and the context of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `b` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `d` is an input value (likely a list or array).
   - `e` is an input value (likely a list or array).
   - `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking.
   - `k` is the index of the last element in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index at which the loop breaks if no such element is found.

2. **Understanding `k`**:
   - `k` is determined by a loop that searches for elements in `d` that are also in `e`.
   - If the loop finds an element in `d` that is in `e`, it updates `k` to the index of that element plus 1.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such element, `k` is set to the index at which the loop breaks, which is `b`.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If the loop finds an element in `d` that is also in `e`, `k` will be the index of the last such element plus 1.
   - If the loop does not find any such element, `k` will be `b`.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `d` and `e` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, `k` will either be the index of the last element in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or it will be `b` if no such element is found.

Therefore, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be:

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last element in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or `b` if no such element is found)**
