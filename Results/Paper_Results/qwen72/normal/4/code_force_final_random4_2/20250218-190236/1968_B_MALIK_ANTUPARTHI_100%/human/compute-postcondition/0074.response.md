To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

The loop head is:
```
for j in range(b):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `j`
- `b`

For the loop to execute, the range function must produce a sequence of numbers. The range function `range(b)` will produce a sequence of numbers from 0 to `b-1` if `b` is greater than 0. If `b` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an input integer greater than 1
- `b` is an input integer greater than 0
- `c` is an input integer
- `i` is 2
- `d` is an input value
- `e` is an input value
- `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking
- `k` is 0

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `b` to ensure it is greater than 0. The variable `j` is automatically managed by the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

Since `b` is already specified as an input integer greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `b` is positive. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**
