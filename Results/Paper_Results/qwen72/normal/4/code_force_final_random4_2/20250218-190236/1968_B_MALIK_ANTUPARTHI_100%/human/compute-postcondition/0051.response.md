The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `b` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1, and `b` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1, `k` is 0. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` == `c` or `j` == `b - 1`, `k` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
