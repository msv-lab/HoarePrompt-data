Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 0, `k` is 0. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` == `c` or `j` == `b - 1`, `k` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 3, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
