Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` == `c` or `j` == `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
