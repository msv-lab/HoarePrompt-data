Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 0, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least one character, `j` is 0, and the first character of `b` is '*'. If the second character of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
