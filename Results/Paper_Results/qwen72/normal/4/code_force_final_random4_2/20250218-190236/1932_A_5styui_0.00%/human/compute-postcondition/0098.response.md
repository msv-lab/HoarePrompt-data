Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, and `j` is 3. If `b[j]` is `@`, `s` is set to 1. If `b[j]` is not `@` and not `*`, `s` remains 0. If `b[j]` is `*` and `b[j + 1]` is also `*`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as usual.***
