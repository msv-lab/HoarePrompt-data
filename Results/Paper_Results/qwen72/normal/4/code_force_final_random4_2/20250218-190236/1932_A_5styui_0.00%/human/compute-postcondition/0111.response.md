The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 50, inclusive, and represents the length of the path. The string `s` consists of `n` characters, where each character can be '.', '@', or '*'. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of the string `s` is guaranteed to be empty (denoted by '.'). The function returns the number of coins collected by moving from the first cell to the last cell, avoiding thorns.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `s` of `n` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is guaranteed to be empty. The function returns the number of coins collected by moving from the first cell to the last cell, avoiding thorns.**
