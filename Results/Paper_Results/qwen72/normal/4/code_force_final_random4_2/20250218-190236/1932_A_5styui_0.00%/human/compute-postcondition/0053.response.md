Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least one character, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, and the first character of `b` is not '@'. If the first character of `b` is '*', and `b` has a second character which is also '*', or if `b` is non-empty, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as is.***
