Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is a set containing at least one more integer in addition to `x`. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next integer in the set `ans`. `temp` is a set containing the integer `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- The initial state specifies that `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'. After executing the code, `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`, but since sets do not allow duplicate values, if `(q + r) % n` is already in `temp`, it will not be added again.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q`) remain unchanged.
