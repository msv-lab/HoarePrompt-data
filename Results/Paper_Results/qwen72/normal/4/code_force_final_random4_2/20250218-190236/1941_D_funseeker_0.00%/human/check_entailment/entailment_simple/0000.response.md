### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` to read a line from standard input and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which splits the input line and converts each part to an integer.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing an integer `r` and a character `c` using `func_1()`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to `temp` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and, if so, removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be converted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball, which is the length of the set `ans`.
   - It then prints the sorted list of players who could have the ball.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is correct. It reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case as described in the problem statement.

- **Correctness of Set Operations:**
  - The set operations are correct. The program correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, and it accounts for the possibility of unknown directions by adding both results to the set.

- **Correctness of Player Numbering Adjustment:**
  - The adjustment for player numbering is correct. It ensures that any player number `0` is converted to `n`, which is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`.

- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The output is correct. It prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of those players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
