Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is a set containing all unique integers that can be generated by repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` starting from `x` for `m` iterations. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the set `ans` contains all unique integers that can be generated by performing the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` starting from the initial integer `x` for `m` iterations. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `r` and `c` retain their values as determined by the function `func_1()`. The set `temp` is empty because it is used to temporarily store the results of each iteration and is then merged into `ans` before being cleared for the next iteration.
