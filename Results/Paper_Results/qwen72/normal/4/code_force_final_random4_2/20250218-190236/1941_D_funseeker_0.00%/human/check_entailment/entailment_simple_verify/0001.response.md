### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line, `func_2` converts it to an integer, and `func_3` splits a line into multiple integers. This is correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` who has the ball.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw. This is correct and ensures that the initial player is considered.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - This logic is correct. It considers both possible directions when `c` is '?', and only the specified direction when `c` is '0' or '1'. The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - The players are numbered from 1 to `n`, but the modulo operation can result in a value of 0. To handle this, the program checks if 0 is in `ans` and replaces it with `n`.
   - This adjustment is necessary because the modulo operation can result in 0, which should be interpreted as player `n`. The program correctly handles this by discarding 0 and adding `n` to the set `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in `ans` and then the players themselves in increasing order.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', ensuring both directions are considered.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the modulo operation results in 0, converting it to `n`.
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 2, ensuring that the possible positions are correctly calculated and adjusted.

- **Performance:**
  - The use of sets and the modulo operation ensures that the program efficiently handles the constraints (up to 1000 players and 1000 throws per test case, with up to 10^4 test cases).
  - The program's time complexity is O(m * n) in the worst case, which is manageable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
