### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line, `func_2` converts it to an integer, and `func_3` splits a line into multiple integers.
   - This part of the program is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` who has the ball.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - This part is also correctly implemented. The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique, and the logic for handling both directions when `c` is '?' is correct.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - The players are numbered from 1 to `n`, but the modulo operation can result in a value of 0. To handle this, the program checks if 0 is in `ans` and replaces it with `n`.
   - This adjustment is necessary because the modulo operation can result in 0, which should be interpreted as player `n`.
   - The program correctly implements this adjustment.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in `ans` and then the players themselves in increasing order.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `c` is '?' correctly by considering both possible directions.
  - The program also handles the case where the modulo operation results in 0 by replacing it with `n`.
- **Performance:**
  - The use of sets and the modulo operation ensures that the program efficiently keeps track of all possible positions.
  - The time complexity is reasonable for the given constraints (up to 1000 players and 1000 throws).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. The original assessment is accurate.
