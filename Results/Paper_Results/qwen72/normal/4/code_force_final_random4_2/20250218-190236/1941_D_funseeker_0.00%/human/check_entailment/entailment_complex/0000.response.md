### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input using `func_1` and `func_3`. `func_1` reads a single line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. `func_3` reads a line, splits it into a list of integers, and returns this list.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and returns it as an integer.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`:**
   - For each test case, `func_4` reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, reading the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw.
   - Depending on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' (clockwise), it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' (counterclockwise), it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '?', it adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` with the contents of `temp`.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it removes `0` and adds `n` to `ans` to handle the case where the ball could be with player `n` (since player `0` does not exist in the context of the problem).

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game.
   - It then prints the numbers of these players in increasing order.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the throws as described in the problem.
- The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
- The modulo operation correctly handles the circular nature of the game.
- The final adjustment for `0` and `n` is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and `0` should be treated as `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
