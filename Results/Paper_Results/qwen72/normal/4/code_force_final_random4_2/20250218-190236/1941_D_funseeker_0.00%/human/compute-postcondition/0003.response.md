The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` calls the function `func_1()`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into two parts, which are assigned to the variables `r` and `c`.

Since the initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers with specific ranges, and `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, the execution of the code snippet does not affect these variables. However, `r` and `c` are now assigned the values resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`; `r` and `c` are strings resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`.**
