Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is converted to an integer and reassigned to `r`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `c`, `temp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The condition for the loop to execute again (`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`) is still valid.
