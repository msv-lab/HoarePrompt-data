Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least one element. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` also contains `(q - r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`.***
