The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `x` based on the return values of the function `func_3()`. Since the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are within specific ranges, the new values assigned by `func_3()` must also adhere to these ranges. The function `func_3()` is assumed to return a tuple of three integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.**
