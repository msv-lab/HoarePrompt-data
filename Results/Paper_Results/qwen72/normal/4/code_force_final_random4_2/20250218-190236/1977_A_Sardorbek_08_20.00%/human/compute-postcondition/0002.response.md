Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers.**

The code snippet `b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `b` and `c` based on user input. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` are now integers provided by the user, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
