Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `q` is a tuple containing the current values of `b` and `c`. If `b` == `c`, the values of `b` and `c` remain equal. If `b` < `c`, the current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`. If `b` >= `c`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a` and `b` have the same parity (both are either even or both are odd), the program maintains this condition. Otherwise, `a` and `b` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd).**
