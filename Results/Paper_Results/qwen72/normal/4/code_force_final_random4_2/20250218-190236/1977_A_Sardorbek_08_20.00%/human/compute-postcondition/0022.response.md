The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **Yes**
