Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 100, `i` is `a` - 1, and `q` is a tuple containing the final values of `b` and `c`. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `b` and `c` were provided by user input, and the loop checked the conditions: if `b` == `c`, it printed 'YES'; if `b` < `c`, it printed 'NO'; if `a` and `b` have the same parity, it printed 'Yes'; otherwise, it printed 'No'. After all iterations, the loop has completed `a` times, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
