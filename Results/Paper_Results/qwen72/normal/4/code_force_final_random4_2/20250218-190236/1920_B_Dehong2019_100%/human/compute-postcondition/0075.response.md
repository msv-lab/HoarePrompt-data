Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])` plus `a[0]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[0]` to it.
- The value of `ans2` remains unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions remain as specified in the initial state.
