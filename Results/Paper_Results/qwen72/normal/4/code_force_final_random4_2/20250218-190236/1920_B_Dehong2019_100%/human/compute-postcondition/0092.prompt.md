Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each element in the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `x` to `x + k - 1` in the list `a` (if these indices are within bounds), `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during all iterations of the loop, and `i` is `k - 1` if `k > 0`, otherwise `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is `k - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is `k - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from `a[k]` to `a[k + x - 1]` (if `k + x - 1 < n`), and `ans2` is the maximum value that `ans1` has taken during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
