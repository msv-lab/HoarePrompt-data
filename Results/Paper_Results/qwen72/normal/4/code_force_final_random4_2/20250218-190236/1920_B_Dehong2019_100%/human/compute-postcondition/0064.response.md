Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is `k - 1`, and `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the new list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.**
