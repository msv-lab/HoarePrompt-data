The provided code snippet consists of comments and does not contain any executable Python statements that would change the values of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each element in the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
