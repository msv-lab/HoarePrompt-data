The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is clear that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An integer representing the size of the array, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k`: An integer, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `x`: An integer, with the constraint 1 ≤ x ≤ n.
- `a`: An array of integers, where each element `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

The function is expected to process these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the description. Assuming the function is designed to return a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array `a`. It processes these parameters for `t` test cases and returns a result for each test case based on the constraints and relationships between `n`, `k`, `x`, and the elements of `a`.**
