Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is adjusted to be `ans1 - 2 * a[2 + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains as the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in the list `a` plus the integer at index `i` in the list `a` but without the adjustment for `i + x` being out of bounds. `ans2` is the maximum of the current `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.**
