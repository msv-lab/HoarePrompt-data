The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at the index `i + x` in the list `a`.

- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `_` is a placeholder variable.
- `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`.
- `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans1` is updated as follows:
- `ans1` is initially the sum of all integers in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`.
- The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is:
- `ans1` = (sum of all integers in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`) minus `2 * a[i + x]`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder variable, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[x]`, `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**
