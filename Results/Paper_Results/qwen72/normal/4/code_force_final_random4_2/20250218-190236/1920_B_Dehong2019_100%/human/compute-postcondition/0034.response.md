Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the input, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers at indices `x` to `x + k - 1` in the list `a` (if these indices are within bounds), `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during all iterations of the loop, and `i` is `k - 1` if `k > 0`, otherwise `i` is 0.**
