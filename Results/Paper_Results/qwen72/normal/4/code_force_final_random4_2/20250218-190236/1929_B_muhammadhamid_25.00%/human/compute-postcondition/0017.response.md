Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\).
- `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\).
- If `k` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- If `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\), the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true.
- Otherwise, `k` is greater than \(2n\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **If `k` is 1:**
   - The loop iteration is skipped, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - Therefore, the print statement will execute with `k = 1`.
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` evaluates to `1 // 2 + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

2. **If `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\):**
   - The condition `k <= 2 * n` is true.
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` will be evaluated.
   - Since `k` is an integer and \(1 \leq k \leq 2n\), `k // 2` will be an integer value between 0 and \(n\).
   - Adding 1 to `k // 2` will result in an integer value between 1 and \(n + 1\).

3. **If `k` is greater than \(2n\):**
   - The condition `k <= 2 * n` is false.
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` will still be evaluated.
   - Since \(2n < k \leq 4n - 2\), `k // 2` will be an integer value between \(n\) and \(2n - 1\).
   - Adding 1 to `k // 2` will result in an integer value between \(n + 1\) and \(2n\).

### Conclusion:
- If `k` is 1, the output will be 1.
- If `k` is less than or equal to \(2n\), the output will be an integer value between 1 and \(n + 1\).
- If `k` is greater than \(2n\), the output will be an integer value between \(n + 1\) and \(2n\).

### Final Output:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the value of k and n is the value of n, and the output will be an integer between 1 and 2n)**
