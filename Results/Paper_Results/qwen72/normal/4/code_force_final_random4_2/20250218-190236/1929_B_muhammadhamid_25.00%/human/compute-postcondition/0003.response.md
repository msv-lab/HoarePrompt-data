The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. 

Based on the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.
- `n` is an integer representing the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8).
- `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
- The current value of `k` is 1.

The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
