Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). If `k` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 * n, the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 2 * n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). If `k` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 * n, the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 2 * n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers where `n` represents the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). If `k` is 1, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 * n, the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true. If `k` is greater than 2 * n, the condition `k > 2 * n` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
