To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\).
   - `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraints \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\) and \(k \leq 2n\).

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `k` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. This means that `k` will never be 1 when the `print` statement is executed.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The `print` statement will output the ceiling of \( \frac{k}{2} \).
   - The ceiling function, `math.ceil`, rounds up to the nearest integer.

Given the constraints on `k`:
- \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\)
- \(k \leq 2n\)
- \(k \neq 1\)

Since `k` is an integer and \(k \neq 1\), the smallest possible value for `k` is 2. The largest possible value for `k` is \(2n\).

- If \(k = 2\), then \( \frac{k}{2} = 1 \) and `math.ceil(1) = 1`.
- If \(k = 3\), then \( \frac{k}{2} = 1.5 \) and `math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.
- If \(k = 4\), then \( \frac{k}{2} = 2 \) and `math.ceil(2) = 2`.
- If \(k = 2n\), then \( \frac{k}{2} = n \) and `math.ceil(n) = n`.

Therefore, the value printed will be the ceiling of \( \frac{k}{2} \), which is an integer between 1 and \(n\), inclusive.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer between 2 and 2n, inclusive, and math.ceil(k / 2) is the ceiling of k divided by 2)**
