Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are read from the input and assigned to the variables `n` and `k` respectively.
- The constraints for `n` and `k` are still valid: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still valid, as the input values are assigned to `n` and `k`.
