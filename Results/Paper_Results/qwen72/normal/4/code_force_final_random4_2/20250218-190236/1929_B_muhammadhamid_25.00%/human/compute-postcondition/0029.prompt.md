You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and for each iteration, `n` and `k` were assigned new values from the input. If `k` was 1, the iteration was skipped, and the values of `n` and `k` remained unchanged. If `k` was less than or equal to 2 * n, the condition `k <= 2 * n` was true, and the result of `math.ceil(k / 2)` was printed. If `k` was greater than 2 * n, the condition `k > 2 * n` was true, and the result of `k // 2 + 1` was printed. The values of `n` and `k` for each iteration are independent and do not affect subsequent iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The function returns a configuration of the grid ensuring that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
