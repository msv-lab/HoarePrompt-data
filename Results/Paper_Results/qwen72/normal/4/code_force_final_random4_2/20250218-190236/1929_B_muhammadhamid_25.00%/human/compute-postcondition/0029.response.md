Functionality: ** The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the size of a square grid and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. For each pair, the function prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 * n, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. If `k` is greater than 2 * n, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. The function does not return any value, and each iteration is independent of the others. **
