The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers. If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, the condition `m < a or m < b` holds. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.**
