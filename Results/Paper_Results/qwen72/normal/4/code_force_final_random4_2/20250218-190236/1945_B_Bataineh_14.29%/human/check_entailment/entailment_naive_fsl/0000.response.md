Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where the two installations launch fireworks at the same time, which can increase the number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 6 5
```
According to the problem description, both installations launch fireworks every 6 minutes. The firework from each installation will be visible from the launch time to the launch time plus 5 minutes. Therefore, at every 6-minute mark, both installations will launch a firework, and these fireworks will be visible simultaneously for 6 minutes (from 6 to 11, 12 to 17, etc.). This means that at these times, there will be 2 fireworks visible from each installation, resulting in a total of 4 fireworks visible simultaneously.

However, the given program will output:
```
2
```
This is incorrect because it does not account for the simultaneous launches from both installations, leading to an underestimation of the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
