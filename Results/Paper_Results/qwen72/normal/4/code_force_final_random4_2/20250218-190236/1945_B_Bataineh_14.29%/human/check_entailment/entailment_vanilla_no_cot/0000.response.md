Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed, especially in the way it handles the calculation of the number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Condition for Minimum Visibility:**
   - The condition `if m < a or m < b:` is incorrect. The visibility period `m` is the time each firework is visible, not the time between launches. If `m` is less than `a` or `b`, it does not mean that only 2 fireworks can be seen at the same time. Instead, it means that the visibility period is shorter than the launch intervals, but it does not limit the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously to 2.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The calculation `print(m // a + m // b + 2)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks launched by both installations. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously, and then calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the time when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
3. Calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time by considering the overlap of the visibility periods.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def lcm(x, y):
    from math import gcd
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 2  # At least 2 fireworks (one from each installation) can be seen simultaneously
        if m >= l:
            max_fireworks += (m - l) // a + 1  # Additional fireworks from the first installation
            max_fireworks += (m - l) // b + 1  # Additional fireworks from the second installation
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **LCM Calculation:** The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b`, which is the time when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
- **Initial Maximum Fireworks:** We start with `max_fireworks = 2` because at least one firework from each installation can be seen simultaneously.
- **Additional Fireworks:** If `m` is greater than or equal to the LCM, we add the number of additional fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.

This corrected approach ensures that the program accurately calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
