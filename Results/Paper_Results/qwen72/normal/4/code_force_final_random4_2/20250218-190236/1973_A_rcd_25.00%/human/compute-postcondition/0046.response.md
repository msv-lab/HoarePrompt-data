The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`. The loop condition is `high >= cur`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` is updated to `low + 1` in the loop body, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `low + 1` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `low + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`, `cur` is `low + 1` and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`**
