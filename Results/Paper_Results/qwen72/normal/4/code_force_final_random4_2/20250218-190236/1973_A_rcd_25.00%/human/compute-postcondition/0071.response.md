Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low + 1`, and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` is now `low + 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
