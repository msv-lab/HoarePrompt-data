Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: We know that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers, and their sum is odd. This means that the sum of `p1 + p2 + p3` is an odd number.
2. **Print Statement**: The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
3. **Sum of `p1` and `p2`**: Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the sum of `p1 + p2` must be even. This is because the sum of an even number and an odd number is odd, and the sum of two odd numbers or two even numbers is even. Therefore, if `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, `p1 + p2` must be even.

### Final Output:
The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which is an even number.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even number)**
