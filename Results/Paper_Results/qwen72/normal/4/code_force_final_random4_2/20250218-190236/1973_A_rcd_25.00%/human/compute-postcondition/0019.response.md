The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `high >= cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given that `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `low` or `low + 1` for the loop to execute again. Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum, it is already given that `high` is greater than or equal to `low`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `high`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cur` is less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, the loop can proceed if `high` is at least `low + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is `low` or `low + 1`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`**
