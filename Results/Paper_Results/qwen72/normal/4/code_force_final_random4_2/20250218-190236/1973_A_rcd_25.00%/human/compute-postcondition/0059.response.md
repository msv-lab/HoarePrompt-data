Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd.
- The code snippet `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reassigns `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to new input integers.
- Since the code only reassigns `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and does not affect `t` or `_`, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still odd after the reassignment, as the new values are input integers and the condition is still valid.
- The variables `low`, `high`, and `cur` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they do not change from their initial undefined state.
