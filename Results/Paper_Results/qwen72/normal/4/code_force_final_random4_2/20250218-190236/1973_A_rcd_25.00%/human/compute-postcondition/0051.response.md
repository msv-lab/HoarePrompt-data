To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `high >= cur`.

From the given state:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is `low + 2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.

Given that `cur` is `low + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`. This is because the loop condition `high >= cur` must be true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` is at least `low + 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`, `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 2`.**
