Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.
   - The current value of `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `low` is the minimum value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum value between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is set to `low`, which means `cur` is the smaller of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` must be true.
   - Simplifying the condition:
     - `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`
     - `p1 - cur <= p2 - p3 + cur`
     - `p1 - p2 <= 2 * cur - p3`
     - Since `cur` is `low`, we can substitute `cur` with `low`:
     - `p1 - p2 <= 2 * low - p3`

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.
   - Substituting `cur` with `low`:
     - `print(p1 - low + p3)`

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `p1 - low + p3`.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the given conditions.

Output: **p1 - low + p3 (where low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
