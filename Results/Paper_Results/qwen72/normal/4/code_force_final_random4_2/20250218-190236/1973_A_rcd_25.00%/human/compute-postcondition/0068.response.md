Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.
   - The current value of `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Determine the values of `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

3. **Determine the value of `cur`:**
   - `cur` is set to `low`.

4. **Evaluate the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`:**
   - This condition simplifies to `p1 - cur <= p2 - p3 + cur`.
   - Rearrange the terms: `p1 - p2 + p3 <= 2 * cur`.
   - Since `cur` is `low`, the condition becomes `p1 - p2 + p3 <= 2 * low`.

5. **Calculate the value of `p1 - cur + p3`:**
   - `cur` is `low`.
   - Therefore, `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 - low + p3`.

6. **Summarize the output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `p1 - low + p3`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
Output: **p1 - low + p3 (where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers such that their sum is odd)**
