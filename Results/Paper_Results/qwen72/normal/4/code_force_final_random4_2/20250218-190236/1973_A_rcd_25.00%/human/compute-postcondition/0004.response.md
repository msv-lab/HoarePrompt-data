The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
