Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
6. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
7. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
8. `cur` is equal to `low`.
9. The current value of `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

2. **Determine `cur`:**
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.

3. **Evaluate the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`:**
   - Since `cur` is `low`, we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     p1 - \text{low} \leq p2 - (p3 - \text{low})
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     p1 - \text{low} \leq p2 - p3 + \text{low}
     \]
   - Rearranging terms:
     \[
     p1 - p2 \leq 2 \times \text{low} - p3
     \]
   - Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it means:
     \[
     \text{low} = \min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
     \]
   - This condition ensures that `cur` is chosen such that the inequality holds true.

4. **Calculate `p1 - cur + p3`:**
   - `cur` is `low`, so the expression becomes:
     \[
     p1 - \text{low} + p3
     \]
   - Substituting `low`:
     \[
     p1 - \min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) + p3
     \]

### Possible Values:
- If `low = p3 - p1`, then:
  \[
  p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 + p3 = 2 \times p1
  \]
- If `low = p3 - p2`, then:
  \[
  p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 + p3 = p1 + p2
  \]

### Conclusion:
- The value of `p1 - cur + p3` will be either `2 * p1` or `p1 + p2`, depending on whether `low` is `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and the result will be either 2 * p1 or p1 + p2)**
