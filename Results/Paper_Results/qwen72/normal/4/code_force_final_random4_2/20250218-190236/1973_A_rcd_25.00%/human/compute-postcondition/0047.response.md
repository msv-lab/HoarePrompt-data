Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.
   - `cur` is `low + 1`.
   - `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

2. **Determine the values of `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - Since `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`, we know that `high` is at least one more than `low`.

3. **Determine the value of `cur`:**
   - `cur` is `low + 1`.

4. **Determine the value of `p1 - cur + p3`:**
   - We need to calculate `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - `cur` is `low + 1`, so `p1 - cur` is `p1 - (low + 1)`.
   - Therefore, `p1 - cur + p3` is `p1 - (low + 1) + p3`.

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   - `p1 - (low + 1) + p3` can be rewritten as `p1 + p3 - low - 1`.

6. **Check the condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`:**
   - This condition must be true.
   - Substituting `cur` with `low + 1`, the condition becomes `p1 - (low + 1) > p2 - (p3 - (low + 1))`.
   - Simplifying, we get `p1 - low - 1 > p2 - p3 + low + 1`.
   - Further simplifying, we get `p1 + p3 - 2 > p2 + 2 * low`.
   - Therefore, `p1 + p3 - 2 > p2 + 2 * low`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `p1 - cur + p3`, which is `p1 + p3 - low - 1`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can't compute a numerical value for `p1 + p3 - low - 1`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the value of `p1 + p3 - low - 1`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - low - 1 (where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and the condition `p1 - (low + 1) > p2 - (p3 - (low + 1))` must be true)**
