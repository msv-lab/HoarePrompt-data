The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where 1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50. The function processes these inputs and determines if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50), and returns a boolean value indicating whether Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.**
