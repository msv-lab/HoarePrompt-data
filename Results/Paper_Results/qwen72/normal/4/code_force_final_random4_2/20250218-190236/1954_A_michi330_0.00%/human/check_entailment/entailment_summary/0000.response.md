### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint up to `k` parts of the ribbon to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve this.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to one color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is because Bob would need to repaint more than `k` parts to make all parts the same color, which is not possible.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
   - The logic for these conditions is correct based on the problem description.

5. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program.
   - The conditions `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` are used to determine if Bob can make all parts the same color.
   - The program prints the correct responses for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the overall structure of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
