Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition `if n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not the most common color is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If neither condition is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, so the answer is `Yes`.

This logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
