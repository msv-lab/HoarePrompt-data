Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the values of the input integers provided. The conditions involving `n`, `m`, and `k` are still valid based on the new input values.
