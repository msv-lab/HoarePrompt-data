Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n == k` and `m > 1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n == k` and `m > 1`, Alice can still paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' in this case.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 2 5
```
Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. Bob can repaint all 5 parts, but he cannot make all parts the same color because he can only choose one color to repaint with, and there are only 2 colors available. The program should print 'YES' for this case, but it prints 'NO'.
