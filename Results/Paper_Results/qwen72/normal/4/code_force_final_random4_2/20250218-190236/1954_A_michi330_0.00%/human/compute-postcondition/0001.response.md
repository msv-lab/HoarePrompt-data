To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `itest` should start at 0, and the loop will increment `itest` by 1 for each iteration until `itest` is no longer less than `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases.
- The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0, and `itest` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**
