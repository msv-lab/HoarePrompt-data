The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should be able to process these inputs and determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
