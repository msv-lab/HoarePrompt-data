Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**
