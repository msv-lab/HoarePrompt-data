Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder and is unchanged.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `m` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from the index `temp` to the end of the list `a` (index `n-1`).
- The list `a` remains the same, containing the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- The list `b` remains the same, containing the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `temp` remains a non-negative integer within the range 0 to `n-1`, indicating the starting index of the loop.
