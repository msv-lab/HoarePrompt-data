Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes. If `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index `temp` to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. The loop has completed all `t` test cases, and the sum of `ans` for each test case has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, representing the total number of test cases.
- The placeholder variable `_` has been used to iterate through each test case.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers within their specified ranges.
- The list `a` contains the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- The list `b` contains the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` as calculated by the loop. If the loop breaks early due to the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `ans` will contain the differences up to the breaking point and then additional differences from the breaking point to the end of the list.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes for each test case.
- The variable `temp` will be -1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or it will be a valid index (0 ≤ temp < n) where the loop broke.
- The sum of the elements in `ans` for each test case has been printed, and the loop has completed all `t` test cases.
