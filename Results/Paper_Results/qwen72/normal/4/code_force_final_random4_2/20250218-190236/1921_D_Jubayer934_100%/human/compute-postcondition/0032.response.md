To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the calculation).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100\).
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (i.e., `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`).
   - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` also contains additional elements for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1` where each element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `temp` is a valid index (0 â‰¤ temp < n) if the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, or -1 if the condition was never met.

2. **Understanding the Lists `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.

3. **Building the `ans` List:**
   - The initial part of `ans` contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is not -1, it means the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met at index `temp`. In this case, for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `ans` will also contain `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.

4. **Summing the `ans` List:**
   - The `sum(ans)` function will compute the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` as described, plus any additional differences if the condition was met.

Output: **sum of all elements in `ans` (where `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b`, and additional absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1` if the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met at index `temp`, or -1 if the condition was never met)**
