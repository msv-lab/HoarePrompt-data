To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `temp`, `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is a placeholder variable
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order
- `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks
- `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n
- `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is `i + 1`
- `temp` and `n` remain the same

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i-1` where the loop breaks or completes, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[-(n - (i-1))]`**
