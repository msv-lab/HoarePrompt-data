The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` of the lists `a` and `b` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is a placeholder variable
- `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `a[1]` and `b[1]`
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order
- `i` is 2
- If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `ans` is updated to include the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `temp` is not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2, and `temp` is -1 or 2 depending on the condition.**
