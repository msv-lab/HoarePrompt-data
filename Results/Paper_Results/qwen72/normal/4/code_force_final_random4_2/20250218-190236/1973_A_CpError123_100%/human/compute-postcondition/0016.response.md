Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.** 

Explanation:
- `y` is assigned the value of `a + b`.
- The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, if true, would cause the current iteration to be skipped, but this condition is not affected by the code snippet provided.
