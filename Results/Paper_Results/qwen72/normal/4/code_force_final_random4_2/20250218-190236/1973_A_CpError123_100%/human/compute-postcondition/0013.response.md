The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` and `y` are not yet updated, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
