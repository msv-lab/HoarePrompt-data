Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players. The scores are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in a set of games must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the maximum possible number of games played, assuming all games were draws (since each draw game contributes 2 points to the total).
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened if the two players with the lower scores (`a` and `b`) played all their games as draws.
   - The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is intended to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played or the number of games that could have been draws between the two lower-scoring players.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where `a + b + c` is odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score from a series of games where each game results in an even number of points.
   - For the case where `a + b + c` is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws. However, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The value `x` represents the total number of games, but it does not necessarily represent the number of draws. The number of draws should be calculated based on the distribution of points among the players.

5. **Correct Calculation of Draws**:
   - The correct approach to find the maximum number of draws is to consider the total number of points and the distribution of points among the players. The maximum number of draws can be calculated as the total number of points divided by 2, minus the number of wins (which is the total number of points divided by 2 minus the number of draws).
   - The function should also check if the scores are consistent with the number of games played. For example, if `a + b + c` is even, the difference between the highest score `c` and the sum of the other two scores `a + b` should be even, and the number of wins should be non-negative.

Given the above reasoning, the function's logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect. The function should be revised to correctly handle the distribution of points and ensure the scores are consistent with the number of games played.

Correctness: **False**
