### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players, ensuring they are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and it prints `-1`.
   - This is correct because the total points awarded in any set of games must be even (either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The function calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It calculates `y` as the sum of the two smallest scores `a + b`.
   - The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Understanding the Calculations:**
   - `x` represents the total number of games played, since each game awards 2 points.
   - `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the two players with the smallest scores. This is because in the worst case, all games involving the two smallest scores could have ended in draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the scores are all zero, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - If the scores are such that the total points are odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given game rules.
   - For valid scores, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games or the sum of the two smallest scores.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Correct Handling of Odd Sum:**
  - The function correctly identifies and handles cases where the sum of the scores is odd by printing `-1`.
  - This is consistent with the problem description, as the total points must be even.

- **Correct Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
  - The function calculates `x` and `y` correctly.
  - `x` is the total number of games, and `y` is the sum of the two smallest scores.
  - The minimum of `x` and `y` is printed, which is the correct approach to find the maximum number of draws.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where all scores are zero correctly by printing `0`.
  - It also handles the case where the scores are inconsistent (odd sum) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The calculations and conditions are consistent with the problem description.

Final: **True**
