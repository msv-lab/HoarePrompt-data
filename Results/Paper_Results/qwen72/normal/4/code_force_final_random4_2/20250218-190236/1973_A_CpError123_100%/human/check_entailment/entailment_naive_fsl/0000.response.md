Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. Here is a case where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
```
1
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

The program calculates the total points and divides by 2 to get `x`, and then it calculates `y` as the sum of the two smallest scores. However, this approach does not always yield the correct maximum number of draws. In the case of `1 1 2`, the correct maximum number of draws is 2, but the program outputs 1. This is because the program does not correctly account for the distribution of points in a way that maximizes the number of draws.
