Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `x` is equal to the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2.**
