Output State: **The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged, `t` is 0, and for each iteration that was executed, `a`, `b`, and `c` were integers provided by the user, `x` was `(a + b + c) // 2`, and `y` was `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` was odd for any iteration, the program printed `-1` and continued to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program printed the minimum of `x` and `y`.**

In natural language: The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not change throughout the loop. The loop runs `t` times, and after all iterations, `t` becomes 0. For each iteration, the user provides three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next iteration. If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After all iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
