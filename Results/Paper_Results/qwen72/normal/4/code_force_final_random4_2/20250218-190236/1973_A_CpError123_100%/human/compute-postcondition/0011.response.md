Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` and `y` are not yet updated.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to integers provided by the user. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` are not yet updated because the code snippet provided does not include the calculations for `x` and `y`.
