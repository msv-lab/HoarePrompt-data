Postcondition: ***`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If the sum is even, the program continues with the current values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y`.***
