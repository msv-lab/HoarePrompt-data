The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, representing the scores of three players. If the sum of these scores is odd, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum by 2 and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`. The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `a`, `b`, and `c` unchanged for each iteration, and `t` is reduced to 0.
