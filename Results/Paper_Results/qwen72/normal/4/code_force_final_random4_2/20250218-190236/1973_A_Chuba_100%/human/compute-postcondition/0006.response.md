Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers input by the user, and the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, `result` is the integer value of `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.** 

In natural language, this means:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain integers with the same constraints (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30).
- `t` remains a positive integer.
- `v` is still a list of integers input by the user, and the sum of its first three elements is still even.
- `result` is now an integer calculated as the floor division of the sum of the first three elements of `v` minus the maximum of 0 and the difference between the third element and the sum of the first two elements, all divided by 2.
