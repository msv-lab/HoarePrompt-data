### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify it against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even. This is correct because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 points).

3. **Even Sum Calculation:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the result using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum possible score that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have obtained without any draws. This is because the highest score a player can get without any draws is the sum of the scores of the other two players.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total score gives the remaining points that must have been obtained through draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Validation of the Formula:**
   - The formula ensures that the remaining points (after accounting for the maximum possible non-draw points) are evenly distributed among the draws.
   - If the sum of the scores is even and the formula results in a non-negative integer, it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All scores are zero:** The sum is even, and the formula results in 0, which is correct.
   - **One draw:** The sum is even, and the formula correctly calculates 1 draw.
   - **Invalid scores:** If the scores are such that the sum is odd or the formula results in a negative number, the program correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem, including the edge cases and the multiple test cases. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
