Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t` is still `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- The list `v` remains the same.
- `result` is calculated using the formula provided. The formula takes the sum of the first three elements of `v`, subtracts the maximum of 0 and the difference between the third element and the sum of the first two elements, and then performs integer division by 2. The specific value of `result` depends on the actual values in `v`.
