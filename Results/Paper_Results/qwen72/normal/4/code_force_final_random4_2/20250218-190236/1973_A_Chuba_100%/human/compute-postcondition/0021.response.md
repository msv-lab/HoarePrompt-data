Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` is 0, and `v` is a list of integers input by the user. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, no changes are made to `v`. If the sum is even, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The value of `t` is reduced to 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time. The list `v` is updated with the user's input for each iteration, and if the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, the `result` is calculated and printed. If the sum is odd, `-1` is printed, and no changes are made to `v`. The loop will have completed all its iterations, and `t` will be 0.
