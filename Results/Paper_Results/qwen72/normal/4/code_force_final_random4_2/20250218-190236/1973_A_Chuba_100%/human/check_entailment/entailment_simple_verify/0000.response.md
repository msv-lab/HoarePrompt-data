### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in the list `v`.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Even Sum Calculation:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the program accounts for the maximum possible points that the highest scorer could have gained without any draws. This is necessary because if `v[2]` is significantly higher than `v[0] + v[1]`, it implies that the highest scorer must have won many games, and thus, the number of draws should be adjusted accordingly.

4. **Validation of the Formula:**
   - The formula \(\text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}\) is derived from the following logic:
     - The total points in a game (win/loss or draw) is always 2.
     - The maximum number of draws is the total points divided by 2, minus the points that could have been gained by the highest scorer without any draws.
     - If `v[2]` is less than or equal to `v[0] + v[1]`, then `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is 0, and the formula simplifies to \(\text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])}{2}\).
     - If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, then the formula subtracts the excess points that `v[2]` has over `v[0] + v[1]` to ensure that the calculation of draws is accurate.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All scores are zero (0, 0, 0):** The sum is 0, which is even. The formula calculates \(\text{result} = \frac{(0 + 0 + 0 - 0)}{2} = 0\), which is correct.
   - **One draw (0, 1, 1):** The sum is 2, which is even. The formula calculates \(\text{result} = \frac{(0 + 1 + 1 - 0)}{2} = 1\), which is correct.
   - **Invalid scores (1, 1, 1):** The sum is 3, which is odd. The program correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Two draws (1, 1, 2):** The sum is 4, which is even. The formula calculates \(\text{result} = \frac{(1 + 1 + 2 - 0)}{2} = 2\), which is correct.
   - **Three draws (3, 3, 3):** The sum is 9, which is odd. The program correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Six draws (3, 4, 5):** The sum is 12, which is even. The formula calculates \(\text{result} = \frac{(3 + 4 + 5 - 0)}{2} = 6\), which is correct.
   - **Two draws (1, 1, 10):** The sum is 12, which is even. The formula calculates \(\text{result} = \frac{(1 + 1 + 10 - 8)}{2} = 2\), which is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. The logic for checking the odd sum and calculating the maximum number of draws is sound and consistent with the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
