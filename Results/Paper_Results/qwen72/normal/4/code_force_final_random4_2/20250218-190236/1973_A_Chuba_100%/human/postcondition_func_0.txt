The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers from the user, representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30). If the sum of these scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result based on the scores and prints it. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the scores for each test case have been processed and printed.
