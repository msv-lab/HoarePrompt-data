Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - `t` is greater than 0 and is then set to `t - 1`.
   - `v` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, no changes are made to the variables.
   - If the sum is even, `result` is set to the integer value of \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('-1')`.
   - This statement simply prints the string `'-1'` regardless of the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, or `v`.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement is `print('-1')`, it will always print the string `'-1'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **-1**
