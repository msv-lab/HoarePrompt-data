The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('-1')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - `t` is defined as `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
   - `v` is a list of integers input by the user.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'-1'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'-1'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
