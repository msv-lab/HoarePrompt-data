### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input. These integers are stored in the list `v`.

2. **Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` because the total points in a series of chess games must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that the total points must be even, and the maximum number of draws is determined by the distribution of points among the players.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the result is 0, which is correct.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the result is 1, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), and the result is -1, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the result is 2, which is correct.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), and the result is -1, which is correct.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the result is 6, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the result is 2, which is correct.

5. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is non-negative. This is necessary because the highest score cannot be more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws.
   - The formula then subtracts this maximum difference from the total sum of scores and divides by 2 to get the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the sum of the scores, and calculates the maximum number of draws using a valid formula. It also correctly handles edge cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

### Correctness:
**True**
