The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a value based on the scores provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) and returns a value based on these scores.**
