### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct and ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player `v[2]` could have earned without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it implies that `v[2]` must have won all the games against the other two players.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total points gives the points that could have been earned from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.
   - This formula is correct and accurately calculates the maximum number of draws.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the output as expected.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
   - Maximum points from wins: `max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0`
   - Points from draws: `(0 - 0) // 2 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
   - Maximum points from wins: `max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = 0`
   - Points from draws: `(2 - 0) // 2 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
   - Maximum points from wins: `max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0`
   - Points from draws: `(4 - 0) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
   - Maximum points from wins: `max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = 0`
   - Points from draws: `(12 - 0) // 2 = 6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
   - Maximum points from wins: `max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = 8`
   - Points from draws: `(12 - 8) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for the validity of the scores, and calculates the maximum number of draws using the appropriate formula. It also correctly prints `-1` for invalid scores.

Final: **True**
