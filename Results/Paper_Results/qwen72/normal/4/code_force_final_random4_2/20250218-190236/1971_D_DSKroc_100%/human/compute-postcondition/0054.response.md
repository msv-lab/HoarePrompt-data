Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 1, `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, and `count` is the number of positions where the integer value of the current character is not equal to the integer value of the next character. If `flag` is 0, the program retains the initial state of the variables. If `flag` is 1, the program retains the initial state of the variables.***
