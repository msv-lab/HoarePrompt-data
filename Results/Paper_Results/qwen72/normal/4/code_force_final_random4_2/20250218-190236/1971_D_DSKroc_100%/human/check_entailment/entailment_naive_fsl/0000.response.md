Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the binary string is already sorted. For example, for the input "00000000", the program outputs 1, which is correct. However, for the input "1", the program outputs 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, as the string "1" is already sorted and does not need to be cut into pieces.

Additionally, the program incorrectly handles the case where the string is not sorted and contains a transition from '0' to '1'. For example, for the input "0110", the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 2 pieces: "01" and "10", which can be rearranged to "0110" or "1001" (both of which are sorted). However, the program's logic does not correctly count the pieces needed for such cases.
