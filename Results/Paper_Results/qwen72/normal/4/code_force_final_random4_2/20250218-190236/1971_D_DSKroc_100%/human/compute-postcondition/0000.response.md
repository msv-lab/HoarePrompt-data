The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. The string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= len(s) <= 500 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= len(s) <= 500.**
