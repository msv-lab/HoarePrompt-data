You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The function should be defined as `def func_1(n, k):`.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string that is the first `k` characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `n` and `k` are both positive integers between 1 and 26. It returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the English alphabet, repeated `n` times. The function does not modify any external variables or state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then printed.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed as `s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`.
     - This means `s` will be a repetition of the first `k` alphabets `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, `s` will be `abcbac`.

   - **Subsequence Property:**
     - To check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, consider the structure of `s`.
     - `s` is a concatenation of the first `k` alphabets repeated `n` times.
     - This structure ensures that any combination of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets will appear in `s` as a subsequence.
     - For example, in `s = abcbac`:
       - `aa` can be found as `a` in the first `abc` and `a` in the second `bac`.
       - `ab` can be found as `ab` in the first `abc`.
       - `ac` can be found as `a` in the first `abc` and `c` in the second `bac`.
       - `ba` can be found as `ba` in the second `bac`.
       - `bb` can be found as `b` in the first `abc` and `b` in the second `bac`.
       - `bc` can be found as `bc` in the first `abc`.
       - `ca` can be found as `c` in the first `abc` and `a` in the second `bac`.
       - `cb` can be found as `cb` in the first `abc`.
       - `cc` can be found as `c` in the first `abc` and `c` in the second `bac`.

   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of `s` is `k * n`.
     - This is the smallest possible length because each character in the first `k` alphabets must appear at least `n` times to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - The string `s` is the shortest possible string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
