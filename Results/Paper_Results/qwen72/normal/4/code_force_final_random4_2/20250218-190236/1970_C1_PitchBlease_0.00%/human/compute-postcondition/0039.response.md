The only variable in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is now empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one tuple.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are the values of the last tuple that was processed from `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` must contain at least one tuple. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited.**
