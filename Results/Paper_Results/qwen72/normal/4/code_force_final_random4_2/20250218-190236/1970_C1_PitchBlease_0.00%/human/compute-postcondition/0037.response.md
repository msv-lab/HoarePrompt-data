Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, and `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` also includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited. `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, and `neighbor` is the third element in `tree[current]`.***
