Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter than it was at the beginning of the last iteration, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If the loop completes without finding the `target` node, `queue` will be empty, and `visited` will contain all nodes that were reachable from `start`. If `current` is equal to `target` at any point, the program returns the distance `dist` of the node `current` from the starting node `start`.**
