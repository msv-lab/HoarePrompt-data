Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are updated to the values of the tuple that was at the front of `queue` before the operation, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` of the node `current` from the starting node `start`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is a valid node index, and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list. `neighbor` is the first element in `tree[current]`. `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is a valid node index, and `tree[current]` is a list with at least 2 elements. `neighbor` is the second element in `tree[current]`. `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended to it. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, `visited` remains unchanged and `queue` is one tuple shorter.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is a valid node index, and `tree[current]` is a list with at least 3 elements. `neighbor` is the third element in `tree[current]`. `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended to it. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, `visited` remains unchanged and `queue` is one tuple shorter.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
