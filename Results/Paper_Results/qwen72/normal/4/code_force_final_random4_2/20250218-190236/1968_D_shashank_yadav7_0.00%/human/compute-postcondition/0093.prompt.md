Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is now equal to `a[b] * k`, `sm` is now equal to `a[s] * k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is assigned the value `p[b] - 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and the program continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is assigned the value `p[b] - 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then `bm` is further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, `sm` is further updated to the maximum of its new value and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and the program continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sm` is further updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
