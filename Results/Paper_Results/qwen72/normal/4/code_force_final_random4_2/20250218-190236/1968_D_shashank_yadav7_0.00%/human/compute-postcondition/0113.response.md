The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is currently set to `n + 1`, which means the loop will not execute as it starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
