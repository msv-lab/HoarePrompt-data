Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha using a loop that iterates `k` times. However, the logic for updating the scores is flawed. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     are incorrect. These lines are trying to add the maximum of the current score and a calculated value, which does not accurately reflect the game rules. The correct way to update the scores is to simply add the value at the current position in the array `a` to the respective player's score.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates `k` times, but it also decrements `k` within the loop, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior. The loop should simply iterate `k` times without modifying `k`.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates:**
   - The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using:
     ```python
     b = p[b] - 1
     s = p[s] - 1
     ```
     This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-indexed, but the array `a` is 0-indexed. The correct way to update the positions is:
     ```python
     b = p[b] - 1
     s = p[s] - 1
     ```
     However, the initial positions `b` and `s` should be adjusted to be 0-indexed before the loop starts, which the program does correctly.

4. **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` as:
     ```python
     bm = a[b] * k
     sm = a[s] * k
     ```
     This is incorrect because the initial score should be just the value at the starting position, not multiplied by `k`. The correct initialization should be:
     ```python
     bm = a[b]
     sm = a[s]
     ```

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic of staying at the current position or moving to the next position. It should check if the player stays or moves based on the game rules, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach should involve:
- Initializing the scores for Bodya and Sasha with the values at their starting positions.
- Iterating `k` times, and in each iteration:
  - Adding the value at the current position in `a` to the respective player's score.
  - Updating the player's position to `p[x] - 1` (where `x` is the current position).
- After `k` turns, comparing the scores to determine the winner.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        
        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1  # Update Bodya's position
            s = p[s] - 1  # Update Sasha's position
            bodya_score += a[b]  # Add to Bodya's score
            sasha_score += a[s]  # Add to Sasha's score
        
        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
