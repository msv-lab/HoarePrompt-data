Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is assigned the value `p[b] - 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then `bm` is further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, `sm` is further updated to the maximum of its new value and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and the program continues.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
