Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b - 1` in the list `a`, `bm` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` multiplied by `k - 1` and then increased by the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the integer at index `p[s] - 1` in the list `a` multiplied by `k - 1`. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
