Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]` and then increased by `a[s]`, `bm` is 0, `sm` is 0, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**. 

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, making it -1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
