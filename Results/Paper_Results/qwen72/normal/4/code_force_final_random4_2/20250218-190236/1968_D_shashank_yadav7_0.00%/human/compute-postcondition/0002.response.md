Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `t` and `i`. The variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are now assigned the values of four integers input by the user, each corresponding to one of these variables.
