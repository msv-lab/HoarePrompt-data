t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, p is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
