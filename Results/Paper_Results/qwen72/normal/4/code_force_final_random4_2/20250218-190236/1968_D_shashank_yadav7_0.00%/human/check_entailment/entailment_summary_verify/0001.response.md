### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices. This is correct.

2. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively. This is correct.

3. **Score Calculation Loop:**
   - The loop is intended to run for `k` turns, but it incorrectly decrements `k` inside the loop, which can lead to the loop terminating prematurely.
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` inside the loop. This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-based, and subtracting 1 should be done only once when the positions are initialized.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated by adding the maximum of the current score and a calculated value. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game rules. The score should simply be incremented by the value at the current position in `a`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the final scores `bm` and `sm` are compared to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, it's a draw.

### Analysis of the Original Program:
- **Incorrect Position Update:**
  - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` inside the loop. This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-based, so the correct update should be `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` only once when initializing the positions.
- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation logic inside the loop is flawed. The scores should be incremented by the value at the current position in `a` for each turn, not by a complex maximum calculation.
- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0, but the decrement of `k` should be done at the end of each iteration, not inside the loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index

        # Initialize scores
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]

        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            bp += a[b]  # Add the score at the new position
            sp += a[s]  # Add the score at the new position

        # Determine the winner
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has several logical errors that prevent it from correctly simulating the game and determining the winner.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and correctly simulates the game according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect, and the issues identified in the original assessment are valid. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct behavior.
