Output State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, `k` is set to -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `b` is now `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(0, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp)` if `bm` is less than `a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp`, otherwise `bm` remains unchanged.**
