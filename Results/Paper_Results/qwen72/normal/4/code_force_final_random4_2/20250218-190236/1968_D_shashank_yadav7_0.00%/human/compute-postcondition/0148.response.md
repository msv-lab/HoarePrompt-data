Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is the second input integer minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations, `s` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[s] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations, `bm` is the initial value of `a[b] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the initial value of `a[s] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial value of `a[s]` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the initial value of `a[b]` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, the loop breaks and the final state reflects the values at that point. Additionally, `bm` is less than `sm`.**
