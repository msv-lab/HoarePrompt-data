To determine what will be printed by the `print('Draw')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the initial value of `n`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`.
   - `b` and `s` are both values obtained by applying the function `p` `n` times to some initial values.
   - `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
   - `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
   - `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
   - `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
   - The loop breaks if `k` reaches 0 before completing.
   - `bm` is equal to or greater than `sm`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Draw')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print('Draw')` is a simple statement that prints the string `'Draw'`.
   - The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly. The conditions and variables mentioned are used to control the flow of the program and to compute certain values, but they do not influence what is printed by `print('Draw')`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`, the print statement will always print the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
