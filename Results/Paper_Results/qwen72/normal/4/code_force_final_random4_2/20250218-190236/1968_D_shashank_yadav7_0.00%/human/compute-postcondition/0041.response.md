Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]` and then increased by `a[s]` + `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, a[b] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[s] * -1 + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`.**

Explanation:
- `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
