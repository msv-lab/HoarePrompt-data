The code snippet `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` updates the value of `sm` by adding to it the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is `k - 1`
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]`
- `bm` is the integer at index `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` in the list `a` multiplied by `k - 1` and then increased by the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`
- `sm` is the integer at index `p[s] - 1` in the list `a` multiplied by `k - 1` and then increased by the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`
- If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement

Let's calculate the new value of `sm`:

1. **Calculate `a[s] * k + sp`:**
   - `a[s]` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a`.
   - `k` is `k - 1`.
   - `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]`.

2. **Determine the new value of `sm`:**
   - `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.

Since `k` is `k - 1`, we need to consider the value of `k`:
- If `k` is 0, then `sm` and `bm` are both 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k` is not 0, then the calculation proceeds as follows:

Let's assume `k` is not 0 for the calculation:
- `a[s] * k + sp` is calculated.
- The maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` is determined.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]`, `bm` is the integer at index `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` in the list `a` multiplied by `k - 1` and then increased by the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the integer at index `p[s] - 1` in the list `a` multiplied by `k - 1` and then increased by the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, and `sm` is further increased by the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

If `k` is 0:
- `sm` is 0.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
