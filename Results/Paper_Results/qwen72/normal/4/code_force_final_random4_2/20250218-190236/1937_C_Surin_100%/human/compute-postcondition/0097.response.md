Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v1` is updated to be the same as `v2`, which is 3.
- All other variables (`R`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`) remain unchanged.
- The output buffer being flushed is still valid and remains unchanged.
