Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is a new string input.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
   - If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input:
       - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2.
       - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
     - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `r` is '>', the print statement will output: `? 3 3 2 2`.
   - If `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', the print statement will output: `? 3 3 2 2`.
   - In all other cases (if `r` is neither '>', nor '=' or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is not '<'), the print statement will output: `? 3 3 0 0`.

Since the exact value of `r` and `r2` is not provided, we need to consider all possible scenarios. However, the most precise description based on the given conditions is:

Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is 2 if `r` is '>' or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', otherwise [prev] is 0)**
