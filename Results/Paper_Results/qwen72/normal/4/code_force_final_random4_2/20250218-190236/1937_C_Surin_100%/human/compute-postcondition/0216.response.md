The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates in an environment where it interacts with a sequence that is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function is designed to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i and p_j, is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this. The total number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
