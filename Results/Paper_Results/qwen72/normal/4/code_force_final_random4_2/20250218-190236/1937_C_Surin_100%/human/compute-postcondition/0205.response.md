Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `i` is 3.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the new input string, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- `prev` remains 0.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Let's analyze the values:
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is 0.

So, the print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string.

Output: **? 3 3 0 0**
