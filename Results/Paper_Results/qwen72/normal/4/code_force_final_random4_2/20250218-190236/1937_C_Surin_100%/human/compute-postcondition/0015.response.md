Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '<', then the variables retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `v2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `v2` is now 2, and the rest of the initial state is still valid.
