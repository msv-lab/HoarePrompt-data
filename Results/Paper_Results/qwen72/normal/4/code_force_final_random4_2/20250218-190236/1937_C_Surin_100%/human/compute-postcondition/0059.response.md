Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop.
- `i` is 3.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is a string input.
- The output buffer has been flushed.
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
- If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
- If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop. Since the loop is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only infer that `v1` is an integer value that has been determined based on some previous conditions. However, the exact value of `v1` is not provided in the initial state.

2. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 3.

3. **`v1` (again)**: This is the same as the first `v1`.

4. **`prev`**: The value of `prev` depends on the input `r`:
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
   - If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.

### Possible Values:
- **`v1`**: An integer value determined by the condition where `r` was '<' during the loop.
- **`i`**: 3.
- **`prev`**: 0, 2 (depending on the value of `r` and `r2`).

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. Since `v1` is not explicitly defined, we will use the placeholder `v1` to represent its value. The value of `prev` will be either 0 or 2 based on the conditions described.

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest integer i for which the input r was '<' during the loop, and prev is 0 if r is not '>' or '=', 2 if r is '>', or 2 if r is '=' and r2 is '<', otherwise prev is 0)**
