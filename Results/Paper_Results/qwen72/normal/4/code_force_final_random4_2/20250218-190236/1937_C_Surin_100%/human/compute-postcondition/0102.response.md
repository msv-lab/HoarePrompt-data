Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the last input string.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `v1` will be `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.
   - The output will be: `? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `n` is not provided, so we use the formula `n-1` to describe `v1`.

Output: **? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0 (where n is an integer greater than 1)**
