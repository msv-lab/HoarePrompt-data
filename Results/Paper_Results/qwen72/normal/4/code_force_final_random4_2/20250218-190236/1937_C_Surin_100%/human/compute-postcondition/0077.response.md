To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the last input string.
- `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and that `i` is set to the starting value of the loop, which is 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the last input string.
- `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
