Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string.
   - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - `prev` is determined based on the value of `r` and possibly `r2`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
     - If `r` is '=', `r2` is read, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

4. **Possible Values of `prev`:**
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', `prev` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `prev` is 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'? 2 2 {prev} {prev}'`, where `{prev}` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions described.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 {prev} {prev} (where {prev} is 0 or 1 based on the value of `r` and possibly `r2`)**
