Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is equal to '<', then `v1` is set to 2.**
