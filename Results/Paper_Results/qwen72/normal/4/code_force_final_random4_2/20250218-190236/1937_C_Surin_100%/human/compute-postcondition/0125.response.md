Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `r2` is the new input string, `prev` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `prev`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects this change in `prev`.
