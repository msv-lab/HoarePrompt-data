Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is the final value of `n`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` only affects the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or file. Since no new input or output operations are performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
