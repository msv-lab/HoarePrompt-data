Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is equal to '='.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means any pending output is immediately written to the output stream. Since the output buffer was already flushed in the initial state, the state remains unchanged. All other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
