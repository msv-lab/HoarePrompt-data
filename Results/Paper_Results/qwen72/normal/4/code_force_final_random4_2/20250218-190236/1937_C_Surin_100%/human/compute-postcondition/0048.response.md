Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed. `prev` remains 0.** 

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` only affects the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or file. The values of the variables `R`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged.
