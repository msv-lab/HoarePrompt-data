Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is 2.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '<', `prev` is set to 0. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is using an f-string to format and print the values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - `v1` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `v2` is explicitly defined as 2.
   - The f-string will substitute these values into the string.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The f-string `f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'` will be formatted with the values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - Substituting the values, the string becomes `'? 1 1 2 2'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
