The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which means `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.**
