Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1.** 

The value of `v2` is now 1, as it has been assigned the value of `i`, which was 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
