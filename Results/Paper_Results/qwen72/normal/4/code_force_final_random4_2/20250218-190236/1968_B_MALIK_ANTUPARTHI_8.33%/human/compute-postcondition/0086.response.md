Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 1, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. If `d[1]` is not found in `e`, `k` remains 0. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
