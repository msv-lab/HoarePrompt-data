Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 2. If `k` == `c` or `j` == `b - 1`, `k` is set to 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains as `e.index(d[j]) + 1` and we do not break out of the loop or if statement.***
