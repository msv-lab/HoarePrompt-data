Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[0]) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 2, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
