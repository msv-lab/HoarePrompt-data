To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 1
- `b` is an integer greater than 0
- `c` is an integer
- `i` is 2
- The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `d` is an input string
- `e` is an input string
- `j` is 1
- `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input
- If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[0]) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The loop head is:
```
for j in range(b):
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` must be incremented by 1, and `j` must still be less than `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 2, and `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[0]) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
