Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken, `k` is the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken, `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The line `b, c = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `b` and `c` to the integers provided by the input.
- `b` is now an integer greater than 0, and `c` is now an integer, both based on the input.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid.
