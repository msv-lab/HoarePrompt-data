Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they can fit entirely within one screen, but the remaining 1x1 icons require an additional screen. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is flawed. The program assumes that each 2x2 icon requires half a screen, which is not always true. For example, consider the case where `x = 0` and `y = 4`. According to the problem, 4 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen, but the program would incorrectly calculate that 2 screens are needed.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
0 4

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs 2 screens, while the correct output should be 1 screen since 4 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.
