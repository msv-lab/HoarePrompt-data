The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 again, which means `n` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list that includes the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
