You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` units of space and `y` units of space, where each unit of `y` requires 4 cells and each screen can hold up to 15 cells. If the space required for `x` can be accommodated within the remaining cells after placing `y`, it appends the number of screens required for `y` to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining `x` space and appends the total number of screens to the result list. Finally, it prints each element of the result list on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they can fit entirely within one screen, but the remaining 1x1 icons require an additional screen. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is flawed. The program assumes that each 2x2 icon requires half a screen, which is not always true. For example, consider the case where `x = 0` and `y = 4`. According to the problem, 4 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen, but the program would incorrectly calculate that 2 screens are needed.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
0 4

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs 2 screens, while the correct output should be 1 screen since 4 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.
