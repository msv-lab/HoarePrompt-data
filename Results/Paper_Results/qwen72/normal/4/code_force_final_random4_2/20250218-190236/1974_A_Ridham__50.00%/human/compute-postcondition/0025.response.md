The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns new values to `x` and `y` based on user input. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to these new integers, and the other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on the new values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is equal to the new value of `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to the new value of `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to the new value of `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to the new value of `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes the new value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to the new value of `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to the new value of `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15 or `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list that now contains the new value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
