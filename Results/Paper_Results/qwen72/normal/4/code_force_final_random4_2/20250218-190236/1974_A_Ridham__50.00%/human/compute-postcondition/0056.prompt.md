Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. n is an input integer. `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if space_x % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = space_x // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15 or `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list that now contains the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list that includes the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_x + space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list that includes the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, and `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
