Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`, and `result` is a list that includes the new value of `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or a list that now contains the new value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, and `result` is a list that includes the new value of `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, or a list that now contains the new value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.***
