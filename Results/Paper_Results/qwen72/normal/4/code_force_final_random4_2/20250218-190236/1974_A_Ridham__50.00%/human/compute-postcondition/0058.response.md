The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these values.

Functionality: **The function internally uses or generates values for `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99. The function returns a result based on these values, but the specific output is not provided.**
