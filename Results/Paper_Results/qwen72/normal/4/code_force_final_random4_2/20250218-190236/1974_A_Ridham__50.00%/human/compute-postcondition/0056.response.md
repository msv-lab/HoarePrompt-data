Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to the last value of `x`, `space_y` is equal to the last value of `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to the last value of `space_x + space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to the last value of `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to the last value of `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If the last value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the last value of `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes the value of `screen_require_for_y` for each iteration. Otherwise, `result` is a list that includes the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, and `extra_space` is equal to the last value of `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `n` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last values provided by the user input during the final iteration. The variables `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` will also hold their final values based on the last `x` and `y`. The list `result` will contain the calculated number of screens required for each iteration, either `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` fits within `remaining_cells`, or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`.
