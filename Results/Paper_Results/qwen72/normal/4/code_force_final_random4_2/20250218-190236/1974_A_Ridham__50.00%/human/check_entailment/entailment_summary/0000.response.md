Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a desktop where each screen has a grid of 5x3 (15 cells). The program's logic can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**: It calculates the total space required for `x` 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and `y` 2x2 icons (`space_y`). Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons is `y // 2` because each screen can hold 2 such icons.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + 1` because one screen will have only one 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Check if 1x1 Icons Fit in Remaining Space**:
   - If the space required for `x` 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining space, the program appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result list.
   - If `space_x` exceeds the remaining space, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`). The number of additional screens is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, otherwise it is `extra_space // 15`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

The logic seems to be correct, but there is a small issue in the calculation of `extra_screen`. Specifically, the calculation of `extra_screen` should be based on `space_x` rather than `extra_space` when determining the additional screens needed. The correct calculation should be:

- If `space_x % 15 == 0`, then `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
- Otherwise, `extra_screen = space_x // 15 + 1`.

However, the current implementation correctly handles the case where `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15 by adding 1 to the quotient. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem description, the program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly computes the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
