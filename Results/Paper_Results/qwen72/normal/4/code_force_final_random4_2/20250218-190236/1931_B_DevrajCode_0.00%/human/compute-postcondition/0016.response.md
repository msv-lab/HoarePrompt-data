Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `water` is the third element in the list `a`, `container` is `2 * (water - target) + (water - target)`, if `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, `container` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `container` is updated by adding `water - target` to its current value.
- The initial value of `container` is `2 * (water - target)`.
- After the update, `container` becomes `2 * (water - target) + (water - target)`, which simplifies to `3 * (water - target)`.
- The conditions for `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `water` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `container` being less than 0 or greater than or equal to 0 is still valid, but now `container` is `3 * (water - target)`.
