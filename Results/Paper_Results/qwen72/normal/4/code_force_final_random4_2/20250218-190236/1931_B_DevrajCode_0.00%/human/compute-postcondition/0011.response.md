The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least one more element, and `water` must be set to the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`
- `total_water % n == 0`
- `target` is equal to `total_water // n`
- `container` is `water - target`
- `a` must have at least 1 element
- `water` is the first element in the list `a`
- `container` is greater than or equal to 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements (since the first element has already been processed)
- `water` must be set to the second element in the list `a`

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `water` is the second element in the list `a`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0**
