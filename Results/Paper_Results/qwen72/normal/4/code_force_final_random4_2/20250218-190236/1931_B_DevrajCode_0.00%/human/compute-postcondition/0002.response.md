Output State: **The program returns 'No'**. 

This is because the code snippet directly returns the string 'No' without performing any operations on the variables `n`, `a`, or `total_water`. The condition that `total_water % n` is not 0 is contradictory to the initial state where the sum of elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, but this does not affect the output of the code snippet.
