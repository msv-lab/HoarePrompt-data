The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `water` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` at the start of the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`
- `total_water % n == 0`
- `target` is equal to `total_water // n`
- `container` is 0

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element, and `water` should be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, `a` must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element in the list `a`**
