The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all integers in the list `a` is divisible by `n`.

The function returns 'No' in the first four cases and 'Yes' in the fifth case. Since the exact conditions for these cases are not provided, we can generalize the functionality based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' in most cases, but returns 'Yes' in a specific, unspecified case.**
