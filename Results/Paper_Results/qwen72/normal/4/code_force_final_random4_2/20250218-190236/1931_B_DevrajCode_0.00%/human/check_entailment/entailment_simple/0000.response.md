### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the first element as `n` and the rest as the list `a`.
   - However, this approach is incorrect because `n` is supposed to be the number of test cases, not the number of containers. The list `a` should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents the amounts of water in the containers for a specific test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
   - It first calculates the total amount of water and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. This check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - The function uses a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount as it iterates through the list `a`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target, and it is impossible to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water without violating the condition `i < j`. Therefore, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic of the function is correct for a single test case. If the sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed by the problem), and the cumulative difference never becomes negative, it is indeed possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - However, the program's handling of multiple test cases is incorrect. It reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case, which is not what the problem requires.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem. The logic within `func_1` is correct for a single test case, but the input handling is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
