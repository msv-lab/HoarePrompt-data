Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, `a` must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `container` is updated to `water - target`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `water`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `a` must have at least 1 element and `total_water % n == 0` still holds true.
