Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, and the loop has executed `n` times.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, which has `n` elements.
- For each element `water` in `a`, the loop updates `container` by adding `water - target`.
- Since `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a` and `total_water % n == 0`, the average value of the elements in `a` is `target`.
- After all `n` iterations, the sum of all `water - target` values for each element in `a` will be zero because the sum of the deviations from the mean (target) must be zero.
- Therefore, after the loop has executed `n` times, `container` will be 0.
- The loop will only return 'No' if `container` becomes negative at any point during the iterations. However, since the sum of deviations from the mean is zero, `container` will not become negative if the initial conditions are met.
- Hence, the final state of `container` after all iterations is 0, and the loop will have executed `n` times.
