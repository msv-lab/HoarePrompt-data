Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will contain multiple test cases, each with its own number of containers `n` and list of water amounts `a`. However, the program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case.

### Issues:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list. This approach does not distinguish between different test cases.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: The program only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases.
3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called only once with the first test case's data, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly handle multiple test cases, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. Loop through each test case, reading `n` and `a` for each.
3. Call the function `func_1` for each test case and print the result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected program will correctly handle multiple test cases and produce the expected output.
