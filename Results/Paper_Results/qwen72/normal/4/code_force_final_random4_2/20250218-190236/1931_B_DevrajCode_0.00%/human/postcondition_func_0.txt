The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that each element becomes equal to the average of the elements in `a` (i.e., `total_water // n`). If at any point during the redistribution process, the cumulative difference between the elements and the target value becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the redistribution can be completed without any negative cumulative differences, the function returns 'Yes'.
