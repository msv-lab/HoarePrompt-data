The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, `p_i ≠ i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 5000; `n`, an integer between 2 and 50; and `p`, a list of distinct integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i ≠ i`.**
