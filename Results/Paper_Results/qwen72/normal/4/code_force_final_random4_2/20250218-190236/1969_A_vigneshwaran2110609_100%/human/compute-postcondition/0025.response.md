Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged. The first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`) is equal to 1, and the second element of `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1).**
