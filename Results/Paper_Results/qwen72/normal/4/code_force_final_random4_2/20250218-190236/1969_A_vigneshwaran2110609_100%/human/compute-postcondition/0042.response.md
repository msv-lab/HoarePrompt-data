Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is `x`, `x` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` in the range 0 to `x - 1`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.**
