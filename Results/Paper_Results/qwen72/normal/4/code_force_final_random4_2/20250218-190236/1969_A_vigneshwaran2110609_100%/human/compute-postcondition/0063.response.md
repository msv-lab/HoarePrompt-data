Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 50`. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads another integer `x` and a list `l` of integers from the user. It then checks if there exists any index `i` in the range 0 to `x - 1` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints 2 and breaks out of the inner loop. If no such index is found, it prints 3 after completing the inner loop. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. The values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged. **
