Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n), `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, and `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `pos.append(s - 2 * n)` appends the value `(s - 2 * n)` to the list `pos`.
- The value of `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.
- The value of `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.
- The other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `s`) remain unchanged.
- The list `pos` now contains the value `(s - 2 * n)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements).
- `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n).
- `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.
- `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0.
