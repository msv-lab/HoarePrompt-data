Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: elements is a list of integers, removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements). Additionally, either removals is not equal to 6, or negatives is not equal to 3, or both. pos is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n). s is the sum of all integers in the list elements. n is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    try:
        n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
    except IndexError:
        n = 0
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n), `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, and `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the values (s - 2 * n) and (s - 2 * n) appended, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the values (s - 2 * n), (s - 2 * n), and (s - 2 * n) appended, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the previous value of `n` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
