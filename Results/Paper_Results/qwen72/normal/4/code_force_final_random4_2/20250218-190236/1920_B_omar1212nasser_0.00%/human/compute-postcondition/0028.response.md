The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The constraints are that `0 <= removals <= len(elements)` and `0 <= negatives <= len(elements)`.

Case_1: If the function encounters a condition that should return 0, it returns 0.

Case_2: Otherwise, the function calculates the maximum value from a list `pos`, where each value in `pos` is determined by the formula `(s - 2 * n)`. Here, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, or 0 if the indices are invalid.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. If a specific condition is met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, where each value in `pos` is calculated as `(s - 2 * n)`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, or 0 if the indices are invalid.**
