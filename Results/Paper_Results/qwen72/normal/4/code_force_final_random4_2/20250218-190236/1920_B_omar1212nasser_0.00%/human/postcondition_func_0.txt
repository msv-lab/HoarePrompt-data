The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being the initial input integer, `i` being `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` being the input integers from the last test case, and `a` being the sorted list of integers from the last test case.
