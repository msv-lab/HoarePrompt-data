Output State: **elements is a list of integers, removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements). Additionally, either removals is not equal to 6, or negatives is not equal to 3, or both. pos is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n). s is the sum of all integers in the list elements. n is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pos.append(s - 2 * n)` appends the value `(s - 2 * n)` to the list `pos`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements`.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements`.
- The initial state specifies that `pos` is an empty list, so after the code execution, `pos` contains one element, which is the value `(s - 2 * n)`.
- The values of `elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
