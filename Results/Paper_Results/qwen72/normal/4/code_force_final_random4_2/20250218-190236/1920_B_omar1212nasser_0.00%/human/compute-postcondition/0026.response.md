Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `elements` remains a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing `removals` values, each value being (s - 2 * n) after each iteration. `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, or 0 if the indices are invalid.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `elements` remains unchanged.
- The variable `removals` is a non-negative integer, and the loop has executed `removals` times.
- The variable `negatives` is a non-negative integer, and it remains within the bounds of the list `elements`.
- The list `pos` now contains `removals` values, each of which is the result of the expression `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `s` is updated to be the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers.
- The variable `n` is updated to be the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, or 0 if the indices are invalid during the loop execution.
