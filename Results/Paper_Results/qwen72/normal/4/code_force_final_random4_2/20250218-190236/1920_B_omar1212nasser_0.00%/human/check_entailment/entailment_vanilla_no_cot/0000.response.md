Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program is incorrect due to the following reasons:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The function `func_2` contains a special case handling for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns 0. This is not a general solution and will fail for other inputs that do not match this specific condition.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Moves**: The logic for Bob's moves is flawed. Bob should ideally multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum, but the current implementation is not correctly identifying and handling these elements.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in `func_2` is not correctly reflecting the optimal moves of both players. Specifically, the way `n` is updated and used to calculate the new sum is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Alice's Move**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. This can be done by sorting the array and removing the first `k` elements.

2. **Bob's Move**: Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. After Alice's move, Bob should focus on the remaining elements and choose the smallest `x` elements to multiply by -1.

3. **Optimal Sum Calculation**: The final sum should be calculated by summing the remaining elements after Alice's removals and then subtracting twice the sum of the smallest `x` elements (since multiplying by -1 changes their sign).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Bob multiplies the smallest elements by -1
    elements.sort()
    for i in range(negatives):
        elements[i] = -elements[i]
    
    # Calculate the final sum
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that both players play optimally and the final sum is calculated correctly.
