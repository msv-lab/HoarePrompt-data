An `IndexError` could occur in the `try` block when attempting to access `elements[-(negatives + i)]` or `elements[-i]` if the index values exceed the bounds of the list `elements`. This can happen if `negatives + i` or `i` is greater than the length of the list `elements`.

The `try` block attempts to update the value of `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`. If an `IndexError` is raised, the `except` block resets `n` to 0.

Therefore, the output state is: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n), `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, and `n` is either the updated sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` or 0 if an `IndexError` occurs.**
