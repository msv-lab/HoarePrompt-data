Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is not equal to 99999999999, 1999999999, 9999999999, 101, 100000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, or 200000000000.
   - Either `n` is not 1, or `k` is not 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1.
   - The current value of `k` is 2147483648.
   - The current value of `n` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('2')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'2'`.
   - The values of `n` and `k` are given explicitly as 2 and 2147483648, respectively.
   - The conditions in the initial state are satisfied with these values.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state; it simply prints the string `'2'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
