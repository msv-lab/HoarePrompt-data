Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: An exception in the `try` block could occur at the points where the list `a` is being accessed and modified, specifically at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. These operations could raise an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or a `ValueError` if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to an integer.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the first and last elements of the list `a` by 1. If the first element becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the last element becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs during these operations, the `except` block will execute and break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. If no exception occurs, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, and the last element of `a` is now the last element of `a` minus 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, `g` is 1. If the last element of `a` is 0, `d` is the length of `a` minus 2. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `a`, `g`, and `d` remains unchanged from their initial values.**

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers. If the indices `g` and `d` are valid and the elements at these indices can be converted to integers, the value at index `g` is now `int(a[g]) - 1` and the value at index `d` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs (e.g., index out of range or type conversion error), the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If no exceptions occur, `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the values at indices `g` and `d` are each decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be such that `i + 1 < k // 2`. If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1, and if `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unknown.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
