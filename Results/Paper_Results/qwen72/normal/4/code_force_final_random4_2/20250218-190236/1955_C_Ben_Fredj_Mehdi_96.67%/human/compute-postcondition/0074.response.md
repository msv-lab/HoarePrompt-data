Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, the integer at index `1` in `a` is now `int(a[1]) - 1`, the integer at index `d` in `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. Additionally, the integer at index `d` in `a` is 0. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is 1.**
