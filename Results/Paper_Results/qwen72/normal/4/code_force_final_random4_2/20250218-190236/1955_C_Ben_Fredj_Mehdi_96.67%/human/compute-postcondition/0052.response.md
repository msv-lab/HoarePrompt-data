Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `k` is explicitly given as 5999999999.
- `k` is not equal to several specific values: 99999999999, 1999999999, 10000000000000, 9999999999, 101, 100000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000, or 10000000000.
- Either `n` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is not 1, and `n` is not equal to 101, 2, 5, or 20.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('5')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'5'`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement is not using any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'5'` regardless of the initial state of the program.

Output: **5**
