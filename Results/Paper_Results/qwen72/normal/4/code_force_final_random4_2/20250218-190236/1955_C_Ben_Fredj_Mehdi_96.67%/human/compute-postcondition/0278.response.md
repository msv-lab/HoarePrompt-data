Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `n` is 2 and `k` is 1000000000 and `a` is `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, the program does nothing and the list `a` remains unchanged. If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, or if `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, or if `k` is 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and `n` is not 20, the first `g` elements and the last `d - g + 1` elements of `a` have been decremented by 1. If `k` is an odd integer, the `g`-th element of `a` has also been decremented by 1. If the `g`-th element of `a` was 1 before the decrement, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1. The loop will terminate either when `i` reaches `k // 2` or when an exception occurs due to `g` or `d` being out of bounds.***
