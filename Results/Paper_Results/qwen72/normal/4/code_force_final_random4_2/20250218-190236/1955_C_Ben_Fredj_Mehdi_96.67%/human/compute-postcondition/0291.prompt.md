Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k` is 1999999998, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, the first element of `a` is 1. If `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs at any point, the state of all variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k` is 1999999998, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, the first element of `a` is 1. If `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 2, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, or if `k` is 4294967295 or 5999999999, or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is not 3000000000 or 5999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. Otherwise, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times `g` was 0 during the loop, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 or a smaller value depending on how many times `a[d]` was 0 during the loop, and `g` is 0 or a larger value depending on how many times `a[g]` was 0 during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k == 1999999998`, the list `a` and the variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged. If `k == 1999999999`, the list `a` and the variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is 9999999999, 100000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 2000000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and `n` is not 20, the first `g` elements and the last `d - g + 1` elements of `a` have been decremented by 1. If `k` is an odd integer, the `g`-th element of `a` has also been decremented by 1. If the `g`-th element of `a` was 1 before the decrement, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1. The loop will terminate either when `i` reaches `k // 2` or when an exception occurs due to `g` or `d` being out of bounds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
