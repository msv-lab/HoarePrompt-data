The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'2'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **2**
