Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least `2 * (i + 2)`, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 or minus 2 (depending on whether `a[d]` was 0), `i` is `i + 2`, the value at index `d` in the list `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`, if `a[d]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1, `g` is now `g + 1`.**
