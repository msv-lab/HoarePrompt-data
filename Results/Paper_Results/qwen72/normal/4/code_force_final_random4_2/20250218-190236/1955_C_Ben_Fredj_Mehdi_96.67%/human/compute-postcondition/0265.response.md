An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the following points:
1. When attempting to access `a[g]` or `a[d]` if `g` or `d` are out of the valid index range for the list `a`.
2. When attempting to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer if the value at those indices is not a valid integer.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the value at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unknown.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **If no exceptions occur, `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the values at indices `g` and `d` are each decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be such that `i + 1 < k // 2`. If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1, and if `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unknown.**
