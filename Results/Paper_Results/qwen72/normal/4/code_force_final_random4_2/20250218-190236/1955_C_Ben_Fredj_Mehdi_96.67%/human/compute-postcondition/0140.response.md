The given Python code snippet is simply:
```
print('2')
```

This code prints the string `'2'` regardless of the initial state and the values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `g`, and `d`. The `print` statement does not depend on any of the conditions or variables described in the initial state.

Output: **2**
