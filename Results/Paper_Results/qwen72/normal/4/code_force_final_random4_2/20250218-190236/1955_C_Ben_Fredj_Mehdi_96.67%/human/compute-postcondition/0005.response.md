Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` converts the input string `a` into a list of integers. The variables `n` and `k` are then updated to the first and second integers in this list, respectively. The initial conditions for `t` and `z` remain unchanged.
