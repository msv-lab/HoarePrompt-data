The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'2'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
