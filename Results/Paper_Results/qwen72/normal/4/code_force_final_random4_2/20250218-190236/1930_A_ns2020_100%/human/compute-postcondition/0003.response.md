Output State: **`t` is an input integer and `t` must be non-zero, 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `A`. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the new variable `A` now holds the list of integers provided by the user.
