Output State: **`t` is an input integer and `t` must be non-zero, 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is now `t - 1`.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but it still must be non-zero. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `A`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties and values.
