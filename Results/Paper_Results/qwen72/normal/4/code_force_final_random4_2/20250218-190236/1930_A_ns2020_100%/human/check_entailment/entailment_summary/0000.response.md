Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum score that can be achieved by repeatedly selecting two numbers from a list of 2n numbers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing both numbers. The key insight is that to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest numbers together. This is because the minimum of each pair will be the smaller number, and by pairing the smallest numbers, you ensure that the larger numbers are used in the minimum calculation as much as possible.

The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the number of pairs `n`.
   - Reads the list of 2n integers `A`.
   - Sorts the list `A`.
   - Prints the sum of the elements at even indices in the sorted list.

The sum of the elements at even indices in the sorted list is equivalent to summing the smallest `n` numbers in the list. This is because the sorted list will have the smallest numbers at the beginning, and the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will correspond to the first number in each pair when the list is split into pairs.

Let's verify the correctness with the example provided:
- For the first test case: `2 3`
  - Sorted: `2 3`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `2`
  - Correct output: `2`

- For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Correct output: `2`

- For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Correct output: `3`

The program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum score by summing the smallest `n` numbers in the list.

Correctness: **True**
