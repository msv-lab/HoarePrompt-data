The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is now `t - 1`, which means `t` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer and `t` must be non-zero, 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is now `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0**
