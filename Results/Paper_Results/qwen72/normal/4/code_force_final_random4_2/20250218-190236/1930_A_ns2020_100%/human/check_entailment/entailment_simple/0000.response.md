Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Looping**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because the problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting the minimum of two chosen numbers. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest numbers are selected first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Summing Every Second Element**:
   - The program then prints the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and by selecting every second element, we are effectively choosing the minimum of each pair of consecutive elements.
   - For example, if `A` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the sorted list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the sum of every second element starting from the first will be `1 + 3 = 4`.

4. **Decrementing `t`**:
   - After processing each test case, `t` is decremented by 1 to move to the next test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available number in each pair, which is achieved by summing every second element in the sorted list. This approach ensures that the score is maximized for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
