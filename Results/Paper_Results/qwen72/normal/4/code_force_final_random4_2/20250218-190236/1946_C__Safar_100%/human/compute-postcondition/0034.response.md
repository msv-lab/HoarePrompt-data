Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (1 ≤ k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. The function then performs a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that the function `check` returns `False` for `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`. The function does not return any value. **
