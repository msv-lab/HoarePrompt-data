The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the example. However, based on the context, the function likely returns a modified tree structure or a list of edges after removing `k` edges.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (1 ≤ k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). The function returns a modified tree structure or a list of edges after removing `k` edges.**
