To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples that must have at least `k` tuples.
   - `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true.
   - `r` is `l - 1` if `check(l)` is true, or `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false if `check(l)` is false.

2. **Understanding `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is determined by finding the smallest integer for which `check(l)` returns true.
   - `r` is determined based on the value of `l`:
     - If `check(l)` is true, then `r` is `l - 1`.
     - If `check(l)` is false, then `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `edges`, and the function `check` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `r` in terms of the conditions given:

- If `check(l)` is true, then `r` will be `l - 1`.
- If `check(l)` is false, then `r` will be the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **r (where r is `l - 1` if `check(l)` is true, or the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false if `check(l)` is false)**
