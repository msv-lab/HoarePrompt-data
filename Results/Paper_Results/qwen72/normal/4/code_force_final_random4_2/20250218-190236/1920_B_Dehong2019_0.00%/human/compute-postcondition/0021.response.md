Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 1, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` plus `a[1]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**
