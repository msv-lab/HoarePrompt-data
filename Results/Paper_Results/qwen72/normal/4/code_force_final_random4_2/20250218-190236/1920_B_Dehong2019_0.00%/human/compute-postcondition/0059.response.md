Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 1, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans1` is increased by `a[2]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further decreased by `a[2 + x] * 2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.***
