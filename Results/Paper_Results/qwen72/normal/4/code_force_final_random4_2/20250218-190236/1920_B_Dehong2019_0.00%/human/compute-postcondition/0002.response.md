The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
