Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the available universals can form a complete tent (i.e., the sum is at least 3). If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts according to their preferences.
   - If the above condition is satisfied or `extroverts` is divisible by 3, it returns the ceiling value of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for calculating the total number of tents needed for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts according to their preferences, and `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (who each need their own tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone, so the number of tents for introverts is simply `introverts`.
   - **Extroverts**: Each tent for extroverts must contain exactly 3 people. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form a complete tent. If not, it is impossible.
   - **Universals**: Universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When there are no participants (`introverts = 0`, `extroverts = 0`, `universals = 0`), the function correctly returns 0.
   - When there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals to form complete tents, the function correctly returns -1.
   - When there are enough universals to form complete tents with the remaining extroverts, the function correctly calculates the number of tents.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `1 2 3`, the function correctly returns 3 (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
   - For `1 4 1`, the function correctly returns -1 (4 extroverts need 4/3 = 1.33 tents, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts).
   - For `1 4 2`, the function correctly returns 3 (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 extroverts and 1 universal).
   - For `1 1 1`, the function correctly returns -1 (1 extrovert needs 1/3 = 0.33 tents, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent).
   - For `1 3 2`, the function correctly returns 3 (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals).
   - For `19 7 18`, the function correctly returns 28 (19 tents for introverts, 7/3 = 2.33 tents for extroverts, and 18 universals can form 6 tents, so the total is 19 + 2 + 6 = 28).
   - For `0 0 0`, the function correctly returns 0.
   - For `7 0 0`, the function correctly returns 7 (7 tents for introverts).
   - For `0 24 0`, the function correctly returns 8 (24/3 = 8 tents for extroverts).
   - For `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the function correctly returns 1666666667 (1000000000 tents for introverts, 1000000000/3 = 333333333.33 tents for extroverts, and 1000000000 universals can form 333333333 tents, so the total is 1000000000 + 333333334 + 333333333 = 1666666667).

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.
