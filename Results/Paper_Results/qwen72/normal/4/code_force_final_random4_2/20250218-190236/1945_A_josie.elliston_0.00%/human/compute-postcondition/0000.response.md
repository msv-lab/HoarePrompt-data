Output State: **`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `introverts`, `extroverts`, `universals` <= 10^9; `ret` is the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.**

The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged. The variable `ret` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The specific value of `ret` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
