Output State: **The program returns the ceiling value of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**

Explanation: The program calculates the sum of `extroverts` and `universals`, divides this sum by 3, and then returns the ceiling value of the result. The ceiling value is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division result. Given that `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers, the output will be an integer representing the ceiling of their sum divided by 3.
