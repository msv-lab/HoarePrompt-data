Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for determining if the extroverts and universals can be accommodated in tents such that each tent with an extrovert has exactly 3 people.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to make up the difference. Specifically, if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None` because it's impossible to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and universals.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, `func_2` adds the number of introverts to this result. Each introvert requires a separate tent, so the total number of tents is the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For `1 2 3`, the program correctly outputs `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
     - For `1 4 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to form a complete tent for the remaining extrovert and universal.
     - For `1 4 2`, the program correctly outputs `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals and 1 extrovert).
     - For `1 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to form a complete tent for the extrovert.
     - For `1 3 2`, the program correctly outputs `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals).
     - For `19 7 18`, the program correctly outputs `28` (19 tents for introverts, 7 tents for extroverts and 2 universals each, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
     - For `0 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` because there are no participants.
     - For `7 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `7` because there are only introverts.
     - For `0 24 0`, the program correctly outputs `8` because 24 extroverts can be accommodated in 8 tents.
     - For `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the program correctly outputs `1666666667` (1000000000 tents for introverts and 666666667 tents for the remaining extroverts and universals).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the test cases and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
