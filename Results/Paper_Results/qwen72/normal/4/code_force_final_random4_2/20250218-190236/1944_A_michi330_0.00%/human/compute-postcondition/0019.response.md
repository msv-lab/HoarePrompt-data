The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, with the constraint 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. 

For each test case, the function returns a result based on the parameters `n` and `k`. However, the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general context of the function's operation.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).**
