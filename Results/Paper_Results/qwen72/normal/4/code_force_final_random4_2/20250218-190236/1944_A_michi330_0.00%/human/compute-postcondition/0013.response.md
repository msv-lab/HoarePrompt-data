The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program maintains the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` as they were initially. Otherwise, the program also maintains the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` as they were initially.**
