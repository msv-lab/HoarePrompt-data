Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys bridges.

1. **Case when \( k \geq n - 1 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints `1` because if Dominater can destroy at least \( n - 1 \) bridges, they can isolate island 1 from all other islands, leaving Everule with only island 1 to visit.

2. **Case when \( k < n - 1 \)**:
   - The program prints `n - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider that Dominater can only isolate a certain number of islands from island 1 by destroying \( k \) bridges. The minimum number of islands Everule can visit should be \( n - k \) if \( k < n - 1 \).

The correct logic should be:
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), print `1` because Everule can only visit island 1.
- If \( k < n - 1 \), print \( n - k \) because Everule can still visit \( n - k \) islands, including island 1.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - k)

func()
```

This corrected program will produce the correct output for all test cases.
