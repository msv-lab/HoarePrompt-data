Output State: **`i` is `t`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, and `n` and `k` are the last integers provided by the user. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function retains the values of `n` and `k` as they were initially. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function also retains the values of `n` and `k` as they were initially.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed its full range. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial value, as it is not modified within the loop. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last test case input provided by the user. The loop body does not modify `n` and `k` beyond reading them from input, so their final values are the ones from the last iteration.
