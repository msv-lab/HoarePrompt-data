The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the second element of `a` plus 0 // 2, `rem` is 0 % 2, and `y` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the third element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
