The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a` with the input integer `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `a` is a sorted list of integers.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, and thus `i` being 1 should still satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again, provided `n` is at least 3.

State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `n` is at least 3, the loop will execute one more time.**
