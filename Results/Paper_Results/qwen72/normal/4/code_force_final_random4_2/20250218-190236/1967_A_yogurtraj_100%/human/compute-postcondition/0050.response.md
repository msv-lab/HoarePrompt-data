The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0, as specified in the range.

State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
