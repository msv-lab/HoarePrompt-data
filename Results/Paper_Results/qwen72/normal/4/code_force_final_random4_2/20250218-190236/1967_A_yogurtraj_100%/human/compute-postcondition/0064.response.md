Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a` plus `k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `y` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - i`.
- Given `i` is 1, the expression `n - 1 - i` simplifies to `n - 2`.
- Therefore, `y` is now `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
