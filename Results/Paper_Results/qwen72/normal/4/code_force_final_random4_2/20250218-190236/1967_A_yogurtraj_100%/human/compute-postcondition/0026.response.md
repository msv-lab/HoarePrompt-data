Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 0 or `n - 2`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is the third element of `a`.***
