Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `rem` is calculated as `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i` where `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `k` is not 0, meaning the loop did not break.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `r` is the result of adding the last element of the list `a` to the integer division of `k` by `n`.
   - `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, where `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `y` is the difference between `n - 1` and `i`, where `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `y` is `n - 1 - (n - 2) = 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)`.

4. **Calculating the Expression:**
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.

5. **Substituting the Values:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Substituting `r` with `a[n - 1] + k // n`, we get:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n
     \]
     \[
     (a[n - 1] * n + k // n * n - n) + 1 + k % n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n
     \]

6. **Final Simplification:**
   - Since `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, it is a value between 0 and `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + (k - n * (k // n))
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k - n * (k // n)
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k - k + n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k + 1
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The final expression that will be printed is `a[n - 1] * n + k + 1`.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, and `k` is the input integer)**
