Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- `k` is set to 0, so `rem` which was `k % 2` is now 0.
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `y`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
- `r` is now `a[1] + 0 // 2`, which simplifies to `a[1]` since `0 // 2` is 0.
