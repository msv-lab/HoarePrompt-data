Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) ≤ k) holds.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be the second element of the list `a` (since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, and `a[1]` is the second element).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
