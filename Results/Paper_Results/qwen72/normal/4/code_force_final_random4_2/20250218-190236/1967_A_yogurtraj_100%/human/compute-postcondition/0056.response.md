Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > 0) is true. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
