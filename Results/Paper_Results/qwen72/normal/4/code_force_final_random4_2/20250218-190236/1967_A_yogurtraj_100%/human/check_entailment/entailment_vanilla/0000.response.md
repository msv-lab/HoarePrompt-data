### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, each with a certain count `a_i`.
   - We can buy up to `k` new cards.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A subarray of length `n` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` if and only if it contains exactly one card of each type.
   - To maximize the score, we need to ensure that the number of cards of each type is as close to each other as possible, because this will allow us to form the most permutations.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the counts of each card type `a`.
   - The counts `a` are sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted counts to find the point where the number of coins `k` is not sufficient to make all counts equal to the next highest count.
   - It calculates the number of cards that can be bought to make the counts as close as possible.
   - Finally, it calculates the maximum score based on the number of complete permutations that can be formed and the remaining cards.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count `a[0]`.
     - `rem` is initialized to 0 to store the remainder of coins after making counts as close as possible.
     - `y` is initialized to 0 to store the number of types that have more cards than the current count `r`.

   - **Iterate through the sorted counts:**
     - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-2`, the program checks if the number of coins `k` is sufficient to make all counts from 0 to `i+1` equal to `a[i+1]`.
     - If `k` is not sufficient, it calculates the new count `r` and the remainder `rem` of coins.
     - It also calculates `y`, the number of types that have more cards than the current count `r`.

   - **Final Calculation:**
     - If `k` is still not zero after the loop, it means we can still buy more cards to make the counts as close as possible.
     - The program calculates the final count `r` and the score based on the number of complete permutations and the remaining cards.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero by directly calculating the score based on the current counts.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is sufficient to make all counts equal by continuing the loop and adjusting the counts accordingly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum score for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It ensures that the counts of cards are as close as possible, which is necessary to form the maximum number of permutations. The calculations for the score are also correct based on the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
