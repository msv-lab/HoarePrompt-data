The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ii` and the input integer `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ii` and the input integer `n`. If `ii` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `ii`.

State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` at the point where the loop breaks, `k` is 0 or the remaining value of `k` after the loop completes, and `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks. If `k` is non-zero, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.**
