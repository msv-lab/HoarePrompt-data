### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - It creates a concatenated array `a + a` to handle the circular nature of the problem. This is a good approach because it allows the function to check all possible rotations of the array.
   - The function then iterates through the concatenated array to find a subarray of length `n` that matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
   - This logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.
   - The input parsing is done using a single read and then splitting the data, which is efficient and appropriate for the given constraints.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Single Test Case**: The program correctly handles a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each one.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a valid subarray of the concatenated array.
- **Unsortable Array**: If the array cannot be sorted by any number of prefix-suffix swaps, the program will return "No".
- **Edge Case with Repeated Elements**: The program correctly handles arrays with repeated elements.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6\n1 1 4 5 1 4`
  - Output: "No"
  - Explanation: No prefix-suffix swap can make the array non-decreasing. The concatenated array `a + a` is `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. No subarray of length 6 matches the sorted array `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5\n7 9 2 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array can be sorted by the operations described in the problem. The concatenated array `a + a` is `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`. The subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted array `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no operation is needed. The concatenated array `a + a` is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`. The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program assumes valid inputs, which is reasonable given the problem constraints.
- The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input data is efficient and appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem description and all potential edge cases. The logic in `func_1` is sound, and `func_2` processes the input and output correctly.

Final: **True**
