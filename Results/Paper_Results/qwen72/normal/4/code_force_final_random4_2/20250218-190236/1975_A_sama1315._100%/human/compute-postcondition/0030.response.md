Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from standard input, processes them, and prints the results of calling `func_1` on each of the input lists. Specifically, it expects the first input to be an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1(a)` for each test case, one result per line. The function does not return any value. **
