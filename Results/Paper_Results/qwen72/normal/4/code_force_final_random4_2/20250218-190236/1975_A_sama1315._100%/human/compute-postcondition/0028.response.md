Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is 0.
2. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, where `2 <= n <= 50`.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers.
4. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
5. `idx` is `2 * t + 1 + t * n`.
6. `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.
7. `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)` in the last iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `idx`**:
   - Since `t` is 0, `idx` is calculated as:
     \[
     idx = 2 * t + 1 + t * n = 2 * 0 + 1 + 0 * n = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, `idx` is 1.

2. **Determine `n`**:
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
   - Since `idx` is 1, `idx - 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, which is a string representing an integer between 2 and 50.

3. **Determine `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers.
   - Since `idx` is 1, `idx - n` is `1 - n` and `idx + n - 1` is `1 + n - 1 = n`.
   - Therefore, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[1 - n]` to `data[n]`.

4. **Determine the loop and `results`**:
   - The loop iterates over some range, and in each iteration, `func_1(a)` is called with the list `a` and the result is appended to `results`.
   - The exact range of the loop is not provided, but we can infer that it is likely a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is incremented in each iteration.

5. **Determine the final output**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of the `results` list with a newline character and prints them.
   - The elements of `results` are the values returned by `func_1(a)` in each iteration of the loop.

### Final Output:
Since the exact input and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and their relationships.

Output: **[result_1]\n[result_2]\n...\n[result_t] (where each result_i is the value returned by func_1(a) in the i-th iteration of the loop, and t is the number of iterations)**
