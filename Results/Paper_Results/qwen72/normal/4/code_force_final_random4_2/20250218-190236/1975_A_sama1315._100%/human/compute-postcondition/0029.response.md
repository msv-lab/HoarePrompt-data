The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.
