Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `a` is now a list of integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers.**
