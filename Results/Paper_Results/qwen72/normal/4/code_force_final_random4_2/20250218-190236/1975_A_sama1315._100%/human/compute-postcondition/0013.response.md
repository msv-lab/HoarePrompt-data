The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. Since the loop has already executed once, `t` should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to potentially execute.

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
