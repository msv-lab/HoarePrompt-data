Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 0.**

The value of `t` has been updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `data[0]`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.
