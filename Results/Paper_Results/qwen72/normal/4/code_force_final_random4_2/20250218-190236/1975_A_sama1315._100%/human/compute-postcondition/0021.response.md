Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `a` is now a list of integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`, which is an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `t` remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
- The value of `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6.
- The value of `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- The value of `idx` is recalculated as `3 + 2 * n` based on the new value of `n`.
- The value of `results` remains a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
- The value of `result` remains the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
- The value of `a` is now a list of integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, but this is already part of the initial state and is not changed by the code.
