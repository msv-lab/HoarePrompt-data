Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `a` is now a list of integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `idx` is `3 + n + n` which simplifies to `3 + 2 * n`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` is still a list of `n` integers, and the elements of `a` are still the integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, but the starting index of `a` in `data` has shifted by `n` positions.
