Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `arr` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, so this part remains valid.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same as specified in the initial state.
