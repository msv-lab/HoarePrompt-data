Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the integers `arr[n-1]` and `arr[n]`, `i` is `n`, and `ans` is 1.**

The set `s` now contains the integer `arr[n-1]` and the integer `arr[n]`, as `arr[i]` (which is `arr[n]` since `i` is `n`) is added to the set. All other variables remain unchanged.
