Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 1.**

The code snippet `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` now contains the first `n` unique elements from `arr` in sorted order, while `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` retain their initial values.
