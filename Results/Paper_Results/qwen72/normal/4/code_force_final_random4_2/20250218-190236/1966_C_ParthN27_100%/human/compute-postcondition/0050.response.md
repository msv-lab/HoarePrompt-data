Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer it was initialized to.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged and contains the integers provided by the user.
- The set `s` now contains all the elements from the list `arr` that were processed by the loop, specifically from index 0 to index `n-1`.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `arr` up to the last index.
