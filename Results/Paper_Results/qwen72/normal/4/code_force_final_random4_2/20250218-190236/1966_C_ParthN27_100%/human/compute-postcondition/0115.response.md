Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ans` is a non-zero value, indicating that there is at least one consecutive pair of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) where the difference is 1, or the loop did not break early due to a difference greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.
   - The initial state provides context about the variables and objects, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
   - The value of `ans` being non-zero and the conditions around `s` and `arr` are given to provide context, but they do not influence the string being printed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, or `ans`.

Output: **Alice**
