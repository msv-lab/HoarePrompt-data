Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, `i` is `n - 1`.**

The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains the same unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, but in sorted order.
