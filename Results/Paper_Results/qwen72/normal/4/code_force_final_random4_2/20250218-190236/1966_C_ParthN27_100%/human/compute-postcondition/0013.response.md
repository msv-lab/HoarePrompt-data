Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n - 1`.**

The code snippet `s = [0] + s` adds a 0 at the beginning of the list `s`, which was initially a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
