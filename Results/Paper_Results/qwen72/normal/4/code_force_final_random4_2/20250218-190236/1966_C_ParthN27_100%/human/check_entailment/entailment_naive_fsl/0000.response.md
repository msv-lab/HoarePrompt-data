Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles at once. However, the program incorrectly handles this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) and win immediately. However, the program will output "Bob" because it does not correctly identify that all piles have the same number of stones and that Alice can win in one move.

The issue lies in the logic where the program checks if the number of unique elements in the set is 2 and then prints "Alice" without considering the case where all elements are the same. The correct approach should be to check if all elements in the array are the same and if so, print "Alice" immediately.
