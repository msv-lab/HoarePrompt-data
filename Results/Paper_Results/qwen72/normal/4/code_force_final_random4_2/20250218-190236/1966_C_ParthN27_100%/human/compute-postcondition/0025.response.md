The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for `i` to be less than `n - 1` (which would be at least 3).

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**
