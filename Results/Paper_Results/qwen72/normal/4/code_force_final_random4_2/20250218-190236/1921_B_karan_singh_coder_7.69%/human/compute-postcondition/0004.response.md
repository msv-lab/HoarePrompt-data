Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`.** 

The variable `s1` is now assigned the value of the number of '1' characters in the string `s`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
