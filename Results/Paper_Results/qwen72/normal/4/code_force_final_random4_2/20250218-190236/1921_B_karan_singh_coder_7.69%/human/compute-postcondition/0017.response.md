Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and the string representation of `t` differ, `i` is `n-1`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and `s1` is not equal to `t1`.**
