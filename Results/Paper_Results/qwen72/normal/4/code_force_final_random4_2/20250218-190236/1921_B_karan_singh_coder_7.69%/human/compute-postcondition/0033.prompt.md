Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a new input string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of the new `t`, `cnt` is 0, and `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    cnt += s[i] != t[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of the new `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is different from `t[i]`, and `_` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of the new `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is different from `t[i]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
