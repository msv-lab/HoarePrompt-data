Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no further changes occur. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `d` is set to the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.***
