Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the new input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed, and must have at least 1 element. `i` is 0, `a[i]` is 0, `res` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 0, with `a[i]` being 0.
