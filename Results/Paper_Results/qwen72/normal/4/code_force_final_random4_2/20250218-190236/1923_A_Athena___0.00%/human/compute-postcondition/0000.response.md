Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, representing the number of test cases. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**
