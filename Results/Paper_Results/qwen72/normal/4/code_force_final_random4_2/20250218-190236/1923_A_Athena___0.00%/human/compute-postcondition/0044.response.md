The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers with at least one trailing zero, the last element (which is a trailing zero) is removed. The length of `a` is now one less than before, so `i` which is `len(a) - 1` is also one less than before.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and at least one trailing zero removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (one less than before), and `res` is 0**.
