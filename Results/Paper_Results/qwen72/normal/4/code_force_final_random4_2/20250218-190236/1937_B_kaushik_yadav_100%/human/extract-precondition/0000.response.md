Precondition: **The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid. The function should return the lexicographically smallest string attainable by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell and the number of such paths. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
