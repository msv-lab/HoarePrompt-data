Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1, `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is 0, `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions. If the second character of `a` (i.e., `a[j + 1]`) is equal to the first character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`), `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1, and if the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', the loop or if statement continues. Otherwise, the loop or if statement breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is 1, `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions. If the third character of `a` (i.e., `a[j + 1]`) is equal to the first character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`), `counter` is 3 or 2. If the third character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is 2, `work` is either True or False depending on the loop conditions. If the fourth character of `a` (i.e., `a[j + 1]`) is equal to the first character of `b` (i.e., `b[j]`), `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the fourth character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `counter` is 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
