Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `work` is False, and `ans` is now equal to the first two characters of `b`. If `work` is True, `ans` is equal to the first character of `b` plus the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` remains 1. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is further appended with the second character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 2. If `work` is False, `i` is 2.***
