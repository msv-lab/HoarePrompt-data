Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, `work` is True, and `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
