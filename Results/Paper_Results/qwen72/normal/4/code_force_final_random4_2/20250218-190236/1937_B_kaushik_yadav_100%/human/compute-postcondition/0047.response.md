Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 2, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, and `work` is False. If `work` is True, `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` remains 2 and `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a` plus the third character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` but `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is updated to 3 and `ans` remains equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the third character of `a`. If `work` is False, `ans` is equal to the first two characters of `b` plus the character at index 1 of `b`, and `i` is 3.***
