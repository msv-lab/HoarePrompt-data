Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`, `work` is False, `ans` is now equal to the first character of `b` plus the second character of `a` plus the second character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
