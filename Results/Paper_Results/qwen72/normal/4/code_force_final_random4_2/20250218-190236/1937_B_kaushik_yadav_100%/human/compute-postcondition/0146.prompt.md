Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is the last index of the new `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is 0, `a` must have at least 2 characters. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1, and if the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', the condition is met. If the second character of `a` is not '0' or the first character of `b` is not '1', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 characters. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is 3. If the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', the condition is met, and `counter` is 1 if the else part is executed. If the second character of `a` is not '0' or the first character of `b` is not '1', the condition is met, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of which part (if or else) is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is 2, `a` must have at least 3 characters. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
