The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 4, and `m` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8.**
