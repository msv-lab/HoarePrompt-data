### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the initial moves.

2. **Initial Moves Processing**:
   - The function counts the number of initial moves where `r_i` equals `c_i` (i.e., the rook is placed on a diagonal).
   - For each move where `r_i` does not equal `c_i`, it increments `num` by 2, accounting for both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move.
   - For each move where `r_i` equals `c_i`, it increments `num` by 1, as the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The function calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions that can be used for placing rooks.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1, which is correct because there is only one way to place rooks in these cases (either no rooks or one rook on the remaining position).

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, which are the base cases for the number of configurations.
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, it updates `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which represents the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, processes the initial moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations. The dynamic programming formula is appropriate for the problem constraints and ensures that the result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
