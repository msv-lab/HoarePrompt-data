The loop head contains only the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-zero value. Given that `t` is an input integer, it needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not zero. The simplest adjustment is to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.**
