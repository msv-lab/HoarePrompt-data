Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k` and `m` is `n - k`. Otherwise, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`, and `m` is `n - (2k - m)`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` is now `t - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain as integers provided by the user input, and each of the `k` moves is still represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i` within the valid range. The value of `i` is still `k-1`, and `c` and `r` are still integers provided by the user input. The value of `num` is either `k` if `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, or `2k - m` where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`. The value of `m` is now `n - num`.
