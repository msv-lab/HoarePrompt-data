Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 31, `dp[5]` is 63, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is computed as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7).`**

### Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`, where `m` is `n - num` and `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`.
- The loop updates the `dp` list, where each element `dp[i]` is computed based on the previous two elements `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- After the loop completes, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 31, `dp[5]` is 63, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is computed as described above. The values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain 1 and 3, respectively.
