Postcondition: ***`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 31, `dp[5]` is 63, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is computed as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10`.***
