Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `num` is 3 if `c` was equal to `r` initially, otherwise `num` is 5, `m` is 0 or 1, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers with the specified values if `m` is not 1.**
