Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which is `(3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which is `7 % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which is 7.**
