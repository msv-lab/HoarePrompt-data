Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is `m`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 17, `dp[5]` is 73, and the remaining elements of `dp` are computed as follows: for each `i` from 6 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, which is `n - num` and must be at least 3. The list `dp` will have `m + 1` elements, with the first few elements being `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, `dp[3] = 7`, `dp[4] = 17`, and `dp[5] = 73`. For each subsequent index `i` from 6 to `m`, the value of `dp[i]` will be computed using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
