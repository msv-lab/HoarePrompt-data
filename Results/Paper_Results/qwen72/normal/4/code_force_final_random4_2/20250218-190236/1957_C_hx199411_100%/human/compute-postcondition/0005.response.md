The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(k)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t`, `n`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `num` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid; `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
