Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, and if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3.**
