Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `k-1`. `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`. `m` is `n - num`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The values of `c` and `r` are still provided by the user input, but they have been updated through each iteration of the loop.
- The value of `t` is now `t - 3` and must still be greater than or equal to 1.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The loop has executed `k` times, so `i` is `k-1`.
- The variable `num` is the sum of the number of times `c` was equal to `r` (each contributing 1 to `num`) and twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` (each contributing 2 to `num`).
- The variable `m` is the initial value of `n` minus the final value of `num`.
