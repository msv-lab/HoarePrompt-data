The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is either 2 or 3, and `m` is `n - 1`. If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is either 3 or 4, and `m` is `n - 2`.**
