The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The `range` function depends on the input provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0. The variable `t` and the lists `p_i` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0**
