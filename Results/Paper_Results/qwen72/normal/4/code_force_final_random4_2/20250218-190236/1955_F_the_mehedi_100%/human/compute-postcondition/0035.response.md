Output State: **`_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the second element in `a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and still contains at least 2 integers.
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`, where `x` is the second element in `a`.
- The value of `x` remains the second element in `a`.
