Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not consider the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Issues:
1. **Initial XOR Calculation**: The program does not correctly handle the initial XOR of the sequence. The XOR of a sequence is non-zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s does not all have the same parity (all even or all odd). The program's initial check `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` is incorrect because it only checks the parity of the first three counts and does not consider the fourth count.

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: The program does not implement the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers. The optimal strategy involves removing numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero. The program simply adds the floor of half of each count to `cnt`, which does not reflect the optimal strategy.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to:
1. Calculate the initial XOR of the sequence.
2. Determine the optimal sequence of removals to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3]
        xor = a[0] % 2 + 2 * (a[1] % 2) + 3 * (a[2] % 2) + 4 * (a[3] % 2)
        
        # If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins once
        if xor % 2 == 0:
            print(total // 2)
        else:
            # If the initial XOR is non-zero, Bob wins (total - 1) // 2 times
            print((total - 1) // 2)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial XOR Calculation**: The initial XOR is calculated as `a[0] % 2 + 2 * (a[1] % 2) + 3 * (a[2] % 2) + 4 * (a[3] % 2)`. This is because the XOR of a sequence of numbers is influenced by the parity of the counts of each number.
2. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins once for every two numbers removed (since removing two numbers will keep the XOR zero).
   - If the initial XOR is non-zero, Bob wins once for every two numbers removed, but the first removal will make the XOR zero, so we subtract one from the total and then divide by two.

This approach correctly handles the problem and ensures that Bob wins the maximum number of times possible.
