The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`, and `x` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element. The next element in `a` will be assigned to `x`.

State: **`_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the second element in `a`**
