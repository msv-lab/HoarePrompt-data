Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `n` must be greater than 0. `a` and `x` have been updated to the input integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `ax`, `r`) retain their previous states or values.
- The specific value of `bx` is now the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`.
