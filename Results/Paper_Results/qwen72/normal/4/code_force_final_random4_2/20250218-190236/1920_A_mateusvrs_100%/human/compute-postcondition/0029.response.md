Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` remains -1 if `a` is 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` is 1, or `bx` remains -1 if `a` is neither 1 nor 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `cx.add(x)` adds the integer `x` to the set `cx`.
- If `a` is 2, `cx` was initially an empty set and now contains `x`.
- If `a` is not 2, `cx` was already a set containing `x` and now contains `x` (no change in `cx`).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ax` remains as specified in the initial state: 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- The value of `bx` remains as specified in the initial state: -1 if `a` is 2, otherwise the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` is 1, or -1 if `a` is neither 1 nor 2.
