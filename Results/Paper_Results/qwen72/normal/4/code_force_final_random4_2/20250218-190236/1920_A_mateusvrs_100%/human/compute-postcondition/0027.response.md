Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
- If `a` is 2, `bx` remains -1 because the initial condition states that `bx` remains -1 if `a` is 2.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` remains -1 because the initial condition states that `bx` remains -1 if `a` is not 1 or 2.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, and `ax` remain unchanged based on the initial state.
