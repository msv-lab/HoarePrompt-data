The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` contains the integer `x` and `bx` is -1.**
