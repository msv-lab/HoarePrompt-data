Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that now contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `_` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**
