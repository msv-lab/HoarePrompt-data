Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1 or -1 if no such `x` was encountered. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing the integer 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `n` is an input integer.**
