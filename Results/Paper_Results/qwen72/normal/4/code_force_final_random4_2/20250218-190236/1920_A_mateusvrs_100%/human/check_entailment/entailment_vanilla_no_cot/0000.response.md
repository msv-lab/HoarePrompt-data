Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Constraint Handling**:
   - It initializes `ax` (the minimum upper bound) to a very large number and `bx` (the maximum lower bound) to a very small number.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` accordingly:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`. In this case, it appends `0` to the result list `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.
   - The result is stored in the list `r`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem, ensuring that the output is the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
