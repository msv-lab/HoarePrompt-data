Postcondition: ***`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing at least one integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is the next integer in `cx` that has not been processed yet. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
