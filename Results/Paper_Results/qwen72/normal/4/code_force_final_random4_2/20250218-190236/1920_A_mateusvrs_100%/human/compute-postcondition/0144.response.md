Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that now contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is the total count of integers in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 0, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**

The value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is appended to the list `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `r` now includes an additional element which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The conditions `n` must be greater than 0 and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax` are still valid.
