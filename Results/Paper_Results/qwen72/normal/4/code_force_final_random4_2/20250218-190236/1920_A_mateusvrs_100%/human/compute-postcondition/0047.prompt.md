Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing at least one integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing at least one integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `i` is the next integer in `cx` that has not been processed yet, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing at least one integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is the next integer in `cx` that has not been processed yet. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
