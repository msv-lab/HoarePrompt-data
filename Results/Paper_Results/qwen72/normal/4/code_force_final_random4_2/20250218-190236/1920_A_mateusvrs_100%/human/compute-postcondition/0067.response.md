Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, assigns the first integer to `a` and the second integer to `x`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `t` and `n` being integers greater than 0, and `n` being greater than 1 are still valid.
- The new values of `a` and `x` are input integers, which replace their previous values.
