The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `r` is a list that may contain the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `a` == 1, `ax` remains 1000000007. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x` and `ax` is 1000000007.**
