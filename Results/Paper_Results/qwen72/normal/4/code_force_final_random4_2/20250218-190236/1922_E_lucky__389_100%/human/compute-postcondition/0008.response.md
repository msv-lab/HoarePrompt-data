The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is the input integer and is not equal to 2. However, the condition for the loop to execute is that `x` is not equal to 0. Since `x` is already not equal to 2, it can still be 0, which would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 0.

State: **The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `x` is the input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2 and `x` is not equal to 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.**
