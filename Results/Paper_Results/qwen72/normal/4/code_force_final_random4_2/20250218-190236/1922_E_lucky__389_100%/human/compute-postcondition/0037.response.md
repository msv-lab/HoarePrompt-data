Output State: **`x` is updated to `x - 2 ** (i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is reduced by \(2^{(i-1)}\). The other variables (`subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The new value of `x` is `x - 2 ** (i - 1)`.
