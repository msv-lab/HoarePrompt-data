Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to 2^i, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i â‰¤ x. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by 2, and `mx` is the maximum value between the original `mx` and `i - 1`.***
