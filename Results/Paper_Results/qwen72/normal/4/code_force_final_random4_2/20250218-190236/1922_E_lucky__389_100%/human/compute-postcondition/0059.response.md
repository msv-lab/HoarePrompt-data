Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of the increasing subsequences that must have at least 2 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with the element `subseq_lens[1]` appended, `i` is 1**

The value of `ansv` has been updated by appending the element at index 1 of the list `subseq_lens`. All other variables remain unchanged.
