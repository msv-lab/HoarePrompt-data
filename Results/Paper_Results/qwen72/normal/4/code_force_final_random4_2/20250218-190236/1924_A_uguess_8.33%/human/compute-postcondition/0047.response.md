Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0, or `tmp` remains an empty string if all bits in `cur` are set to 1, `ans` is updated by appending `tmp` to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the variable `ans`. The value of `i` and the condition for `tmp` remain unchanged. If `tmp` is a character, it is appended to `ans`. If `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` remains unchanged.
