Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- `cur_ss` is assigned the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, where `ord(ss)` is the ASCII value of the first character of the string `s`, and `ord('a')` is the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ss` remains the first character of `s`.
- The value of `cur_ss` is the result of the subtraction of the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`.
