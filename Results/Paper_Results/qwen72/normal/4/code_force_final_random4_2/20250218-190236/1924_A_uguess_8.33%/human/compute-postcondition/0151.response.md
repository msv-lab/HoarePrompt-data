Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` for all iterations, `cur` is 0 if the loop has reset it due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1` in the last iteration, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a' for the last iteration, `ans` is a string that, if `cnt` is less than `n`, consists of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by the character `tmp` (which is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0), and then `(n - cnt - 1)` repetitions of the character `'a'`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is not modified, and the program prints 'YES' for each iteration where `cnt` >= `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, so `t` is now 0.
- **`i` is `t - 1`**: The loop index `i` has reached `t - 1` after the last iteration.
- **`n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers**: These values are unchanged from the initial state as they are input parameters for each iteration.
- **`s` is a non-empty input string**: The string `s` is the input for the last iteration.
- **`cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` for all iterations**: `cnt` is the total count of sequences of `k` unique characters found in `s` across all iterations.
- **`cur` is 0 if the loop has reset it due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1` in the last iteration, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a' for the last iteration**: `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` in the last iteration, otherwise it retains the bitwise OR of the differences.
- **`ans` is a string that, if `cnt` is less than `n`, consists of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by the character `tmp` (which is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0), and then `(n - cnt - 1)` repetitions of the character `'a'`**: If `cnt` is less than `n` in the last iteration, `ans` is constructed as described. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is not modified, and 'YES' is printed for that iteration.
- **If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints 'YES' for each iteration where `cnt` >= `n`**: For each iteration where the loop found `cnt` to be greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed.
