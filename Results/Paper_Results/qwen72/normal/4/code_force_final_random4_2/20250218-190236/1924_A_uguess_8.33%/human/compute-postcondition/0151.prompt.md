Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a combination of characters in `s` that set all bits in `cur` to 1 (i.e., `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`), and `cur` is 0 if `cur` has been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program retains the current values of `i`, `cur`, and `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is set to `k-1`, `tmp` is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0, or `tmp` remains an empty string if all bits in `cur` are set to 1, and `ans` is updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1 if `cnt` >= `n` or `i` is `k-1` if `cnt` < `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`. If `cnt` >= `n`, the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `cnt` < `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', and `ans` is now one character longer with the character `tmp` appended to it, followed by `n - cnt - 1` characters 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program retains these values. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` and then `(n - cnt - 1)` repetitions of the character `'a'`, and `i` is `k-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
