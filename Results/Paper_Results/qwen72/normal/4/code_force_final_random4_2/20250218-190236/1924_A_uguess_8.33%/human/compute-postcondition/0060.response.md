Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << (ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a')`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
