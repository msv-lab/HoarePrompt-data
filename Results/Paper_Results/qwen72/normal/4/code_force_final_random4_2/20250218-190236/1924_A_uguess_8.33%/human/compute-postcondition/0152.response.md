The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, representing the number of unique characters in the string.
- `k`: an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, representing the number of unique characters that can be used in the string.
- `m`: an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, representing the length of the string.
- `s`: a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The function returns different values based on the input:
- Case_1: If the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases exceeds 10^6, the function returns an error message indicating that the input exceeds the allowed limit.
- Case_2: Otherwise, the function processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. If the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases exceeds 10^6, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to `s`.**
