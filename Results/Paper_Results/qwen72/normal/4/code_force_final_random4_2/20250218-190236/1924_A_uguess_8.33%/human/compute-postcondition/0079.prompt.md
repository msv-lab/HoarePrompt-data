Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
