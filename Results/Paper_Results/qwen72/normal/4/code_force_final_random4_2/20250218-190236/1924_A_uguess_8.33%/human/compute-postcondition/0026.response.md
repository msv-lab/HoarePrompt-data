Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If `cur` was initially equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is now 1.
- If `cur` was not equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is now 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.
