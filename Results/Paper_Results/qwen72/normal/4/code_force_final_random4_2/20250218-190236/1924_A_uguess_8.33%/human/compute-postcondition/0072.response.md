The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `ss` was the second character of `s`, and `s` is a non-empty input string. For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `ss` will be the third character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` is 0.**
