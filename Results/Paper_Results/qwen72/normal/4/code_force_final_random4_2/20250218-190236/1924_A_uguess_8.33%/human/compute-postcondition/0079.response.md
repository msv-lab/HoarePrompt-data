Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
- **`s`**: The string `s` is iterated over, but it is not modified, so it remains the same.
- **`cnt`**: This variable counts how many times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. Each time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is reset to 0.
- **`cur`**: This variable is a bitmask that keeps track of which characters (from 'a' to the `k`-th letter) have been encountered in the string `s`. For each character `ss` in `s`, `cur` is updated by setting the bit corresponding to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it is reset to 0, and the process continues. After the loop finishes, `cur` will be the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`. This means that `cur` will represent the set of characters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter that were encountered in the string `s` but did not complete a full set of `k` unique characters.
