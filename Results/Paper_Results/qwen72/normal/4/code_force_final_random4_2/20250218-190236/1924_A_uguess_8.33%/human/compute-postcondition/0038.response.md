Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a'**. 

The code snippet assigns the character 'a' to the variable `tmp` by converting the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97) to a character and then adding the value of `i` (which is 0) to it. The values of `i`, `k`, and the bit at position `i` in `cur` remain unchanged.
