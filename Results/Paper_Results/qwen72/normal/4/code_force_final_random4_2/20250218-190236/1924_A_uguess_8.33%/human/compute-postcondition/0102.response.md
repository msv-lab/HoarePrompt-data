Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 2 if `cnt` >= `n` or `i` is `k` if `cnt` < `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`. If `cnt` >= `n`, the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `cnt` < `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', and `ans` is now one character longer with the character `tmp` appended to it, followed by `n - cnt - 1` characters 'a'.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `i`, `cnt`, `cur`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated based on the input provided by `input().split()`.
- `n` is now an integer input.
- `k` is now an integer input greater than 0.
- `m` is now an integer input.
- The conditions and relationships involving `cnt`, `i`, `cur`, and `ans` remain as described in the initial state.
