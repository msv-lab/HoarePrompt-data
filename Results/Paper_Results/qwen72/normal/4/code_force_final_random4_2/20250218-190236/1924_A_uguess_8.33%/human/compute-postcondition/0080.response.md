Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
