Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s`.
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, or `n`. The precondition only provides context about the state of the program but does not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

Output: **YES**
