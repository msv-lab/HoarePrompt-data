Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is updated to `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`).**

Explanation:
- `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`) remain unchanged.
