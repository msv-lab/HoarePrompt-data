Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `count` now includes the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value of 1 if it was not already a key, otherwise the value of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` in `count` is increased by 1. `res` is not affected.**
