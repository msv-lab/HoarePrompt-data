#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is the transformed value of an element in `a` and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed value appeared in `a`.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element. The transformation effectively toggles the highest bit of each integer in the list. The function also modifies a dictionary `count` where each key is the transformed value of an element in `a`, and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed value appeared in `a`.
