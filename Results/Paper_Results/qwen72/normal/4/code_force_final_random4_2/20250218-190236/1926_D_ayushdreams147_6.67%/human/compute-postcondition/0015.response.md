Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `count` now includes the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value of 1 (if it was not already a key) or the value of this key is incremented by 1 (if it was already a key), `res` is not affected.**
