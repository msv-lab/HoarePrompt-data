### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The program sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting coordinates will help in identifying the side lengths of the square, but it is important to understand how the sorting works.
   - Sorting a list of tuples in Python will first sort by the first element (x-coordinate) and then by the second element (y-coordinate) if the first elements are equal.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`).
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between the first and second points should be the same as the distance between the third and fourth points. This is because the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, should be adjacent corners of the square.

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The program takes the square root of `p1` and `p2` to get the side lengths and then multiplies them to get the area.
   - However, since `p1` and `p2` are already the squared distances of the side lengths, the area of the square is simply `p1` (or `p2`), and taking the square root and then multiplying is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The correct way to calculate the area is simply `p1` or `p2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the area of the square for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Area Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the area as `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, which is incorrect. The area of the square should be `p1` (or `p2`), since `p1` and `p2` are already the squared side lengths.
  - The correct way to calculate the area is simply `p1` or `p2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
        res = p1  # or p2, since they should be equal
        print(res)
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary and incorrect method to calculate the area of the square.

Final: **False**
