Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3.**

The value of `p1` has been updated to the sum of the squares of the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two elements in the `coord` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
