Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3.**

In natural language: The value of `p1` is now the result of the expression `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, which calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the `coord` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
