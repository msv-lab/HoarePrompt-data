Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**

The tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to the list `coord`, which now contains two identical tuples `(x, y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
