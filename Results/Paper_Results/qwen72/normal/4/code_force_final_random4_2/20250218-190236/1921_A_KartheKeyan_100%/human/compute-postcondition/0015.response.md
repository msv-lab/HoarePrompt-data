Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The `coord` list is now sorted based on the tuples it contains, while the values of `total`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
