Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The code appends the new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`, which already contains two tuples `(x, y)`. The values of `total`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
