The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list with at least 6 elements (the original 5 elements plus the new element `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
