Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero and greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `_` is 1**

The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
