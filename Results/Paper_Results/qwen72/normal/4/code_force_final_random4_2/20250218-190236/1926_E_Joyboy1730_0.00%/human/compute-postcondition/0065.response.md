Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - a`, `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 0. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
