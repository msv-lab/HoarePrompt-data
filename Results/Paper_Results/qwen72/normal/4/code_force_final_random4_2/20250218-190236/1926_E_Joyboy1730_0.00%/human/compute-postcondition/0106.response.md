Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `L`, `tot` is `tot + a`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 1, `_` is 1, `k` is `k - tot`.**

The value of `pow` is updated to 4, as it was initially 2 and is then multiplied by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
