Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `L` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - `a` is the third element in the list `L`.
   - `tot` is `tot + a` (assuming `tot` was initially 0, so `tot` becomes `a`).
   - `pow` is 4.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `k` is `k - tot` (so `k` becomes `k - a`).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be printed is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `pow` is explicitly given as 4.
   - `k` is initially some value, but after the initial state, it becomes `k - a` where `a` is the third element in the list `L`.

4. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   - The expression `2 * k - 1` becomes `2 * (k - a) - 1`.
   - Therefore, the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)` becomes `4 * (2 * (k - a) - 1)`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     4 * (2 * (k - a) - 1) = 4 * (2k - 2a - 1) = 8k - 8a - 4
     \]

6. **Output:**
   - The final output will be the value of the expression `8k - 8a - 4`.

Since `k` and `a` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **8k - 8a - 4 (where k is the initial value of k and a is the third element in the list L)**
