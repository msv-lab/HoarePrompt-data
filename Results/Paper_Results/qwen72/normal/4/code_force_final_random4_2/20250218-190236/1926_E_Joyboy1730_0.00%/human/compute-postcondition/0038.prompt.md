Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` has at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2. If `a` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `2 * a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (L[0] + a)`, `L` has at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is the first element in `L` + `a`, `pow` is 4. If `tot` < `k` and `k` <= `tot` + `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (L[0] + a) - tot`, `L` has at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is the first element in `L` + `2 * a`, `pow` is 8. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
