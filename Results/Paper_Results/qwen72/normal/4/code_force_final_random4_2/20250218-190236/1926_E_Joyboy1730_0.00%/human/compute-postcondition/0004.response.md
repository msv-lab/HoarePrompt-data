The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `L` is an empty list. Since `n` is an input integer, it can be any integer, including 0, which would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to ensure it is not 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list**
