The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, which suggests that `t` represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, indicating that `n` and `k` are integers where `k` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to process `t` test cases, each with parameters `n` and `k`, and return a result based on these parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships, so the exact return value cannot be determined without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function processes `t` test cases and returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
