Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
