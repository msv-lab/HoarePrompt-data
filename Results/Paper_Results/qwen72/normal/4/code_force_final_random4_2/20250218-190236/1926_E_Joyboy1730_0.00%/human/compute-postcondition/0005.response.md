Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is a non-zero integer. The floor division `//` ensures that `m` will be an integer. The other variables (`t`, `k`, and `L`) remain unchanged.
