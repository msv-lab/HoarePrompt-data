Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 1, `_` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `k` is updated to `k - a` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, `pow`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
