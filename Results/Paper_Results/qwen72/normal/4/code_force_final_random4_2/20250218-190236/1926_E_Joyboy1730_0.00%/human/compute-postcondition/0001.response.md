The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` are not directly relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
