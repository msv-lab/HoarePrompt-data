Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. The function processes each test case and prints a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, it calculates and prints a value that is `pow * (2 * k - 1)` if a certain condition is met during the processing, where `pow` is a power of 2. If the condition is not met, the function does not print anything for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` being 0, `L` being an empty list, `tot` being 0, and `pow` being 1. **
