#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer and always equals 1, u and v are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and u1 is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers. After all iterations, `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` remains 1, `u` and `v` remain integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` remains an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, and `numbers` is a list containing all the sublists `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each sublist represents a pair of integers. If the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers, the loop will break, and the `numbers` list will contain all the valid pairs of integers up to that point.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each pair consists of integers `num1` and `num2` such that 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The list `numbers` will include all the pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` from user input until the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers. It returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each pair consists of integers `num1` and `num2` such that 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The list `numbers` will include all the pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers.
