The code snippet `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nums`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer and always equals 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n. The `numbers` list is initially empty. After executing the code, `nums` will contain a list of strings, each representing a number input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is an empty list, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user.**
