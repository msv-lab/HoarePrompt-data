Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublists `[num1, num2]`, `[num1, num2]`, and `[num1, num2]`, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `numbers.append([num1, num2])` appends the sublist `[num1, num2]` to the existing list `numbers`.
- Initially, `numbers` contains the sublists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`.
- After appending, `numbers` now contains three sublists: `[num1, num2]`, `[num1, num2]`, and `[num1, num2]`.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `u1` remain unchanged.
- The values of `num1` and `num2` are still the integer values of the first and second elements in `nums`, respectively.
- The condition regarding the length of `nums` and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
