Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer and always equals 1, u and v are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and u1 is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublist `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublists `[num1, num2]`, `[num1, num2]`, and `[num1, num2]`, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
