You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer and always equals 1, u and v are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and u1 is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers. After all iterations, `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` remains 1, `u` and `v` remain integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` remains an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, and `numbers` is a list containing all the sublists `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each sublist represents a pair of integers. If the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers, the loop will break, and the `numbers` list will contain all the valid pairs of integers up to that point.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each pair consists of integers `num1` and `num2` such that 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The list `numbers` will include all the pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` from user input, where each integer is within the range 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and n is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. It returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each pair consists of integers `num1` and `num2` such that 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The list `numbers` will include all the pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
