Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublist `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `num1` and the original values of the other variables.**
