Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublist `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nums`.
- The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user. After the code execution, `nums` is updated to the new list of strings obtained from the input.
- The values of `num1` and `num2` are derived from the first and second elements of `nums`, respectively. Therefore, `num1` and `num2` are still the integer values of the first and second elements in `nums`.
- The precondition that if the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, remains valid.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u1`, `numbers`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
