The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is designed to work with implicit constraints and relationships where `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `u` and `v` are integers within the range 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The function reads pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` from the user input, where each integer is within the range 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n. The function continues to read pairs until the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers. The function returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user.

Functionality: **The function reads pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` from user input, where each integer is within the range 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and n is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. It returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers.**
