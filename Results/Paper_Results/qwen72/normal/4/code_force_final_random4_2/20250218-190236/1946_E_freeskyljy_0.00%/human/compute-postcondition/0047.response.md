Output State: **`N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, `cur` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD`, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
