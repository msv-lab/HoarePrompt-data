Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD` if `M2` is greater than 1. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.** 

In natural language, this means:
- If `M2` is greater than 1, the program calculates `ans` as the product of all values from `nums_left` (which is `N - R[0] - 1`) down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, and then takes the result modulo `MOD`.
- If `M2` is not greater than 1, the program updates `ans` to the product of all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution, and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `cur` is determined based on the conditions specified for `M1` and `L`.
