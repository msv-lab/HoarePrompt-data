### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads two lists `L` and `R`, which contain the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. If not, it returns 0, as this indicates that the permutation cannot be valid. This check is correct because the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must coincide.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns 0, as the first prefix maximum must be at index 1 and the last suffix maximum must be at index `N`. This is correct based on the problem constraints.
   - It further checks if `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If so, it returns 0, as this would imply an overlap that is not possible in a valid permutation. This check is also correct.

2. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose the positions for the remaining elements using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is correct because it determines the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the positions between the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum.

3. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates backward from the last prefix maximum to the first, updating the `ans` value by multiplying it with the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position. This is done using a loop that skips the positions already occupied by prefix maximums.
   - The loop correctly updates `ans` and ensures that the product is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program iterates forward from the first suffix maximum to the last, updating the `ans` value by multiplying it with the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position. This is done using a loop that skips the positions already occupied by suffix maximums.
   - The loop correctly updates `ans` and ensures that the product is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Final Return:**
   - The program returns the final value of `ans`, which is the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums and ensuring that the product is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
