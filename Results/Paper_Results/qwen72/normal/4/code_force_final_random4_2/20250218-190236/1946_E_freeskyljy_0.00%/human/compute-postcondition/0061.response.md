Output State: **`N` is greater than `R[0] + 3`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, `i` is `R[0] + 3`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Initially, `nums_left` was `N - R[0] - 3`, so after the decrement, `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 4`. The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains `R[0] + 3`, and the value of `ans` remains `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`. The condition for updating `cur` is not affected by this code snippet, so `cur` remains 1 unless `i` equals `R[cur]`.
