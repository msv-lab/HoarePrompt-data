Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads three integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `L` and `R`. It checks several conditions and returns 0 if any of the following are true: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is not 1, the first element of `R` is not `N`, or if `M1` and `M2` are both greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function calculates a value `ans` based on the combination of `N-1` choose `L[-1]-1` and updates it through a series of loops. The final value of `ans` is the product of certain elements, taken modulo `MOD`, and is returned. **
