Output State: **`N` is greater than `R[0] + 3`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[0] + 3`, `cur` is 2, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`.**

The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
