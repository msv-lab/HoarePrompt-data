Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged; `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4`. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is decreased by 1.
- All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, `i`, `cur`) and conditions remain unchanged.
