Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`; `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**

The code snippet assigns the value `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `cur` is still `M1 - 2`. The value of `nums_left` is still `L[-1] - 2`. The new value of `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.
