Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the input correctly for each test case.
   - It checks if the last element of the list of prefix maximums (`L[-1]`) is equal to the first element of the list of suffix maximums (`R[0]`). This is a necessary condition because the maximum element of the permutation must be a common prefix and suffix maximum.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This ensures that the permutation starts with the smallest element and ends with the largest element, which is a requirement for valid prefix and suffix maximums.
   - If `M1` and `M2` are both greater than 1, it checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This condition ensures that the second largest element is not simultaneously a prefix and suffix maximum, which would be invalid.

2. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the initial value of `ans` using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements that are not the maximum element (which is fixed at `L[-1]` and `R[0]`).

3. **Loop for Prefix Maximums:**
   - The function then iterates backward from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element, updating `ans` by multiplying it with the number of available positions (`nums_left`) and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This loop ensures that the elements that are not prefix maximums are placed correctly, avoiding positions that are already occupied by prefix maximums.

4. **Loop for Suffix Maximums:**
   - The function iterates forward from the second element of `R` to the last element, updating `ans` similarly by multiplying it with the number of available positions (`nums_left`) and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This loop ensures that the elements that are not suffix maximums are placed correctly, avoiding positions that are already occupied by suffix maximums.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The function returns the final value of `ans`, which represents the number of valid permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Potential Issues:**
- The function does not handle the case where `M1` or `M2` is 1 separately in the loops. However, the initial checks should ensure that the loops are only executed when `M1` or `M2` is greater than 1.
- The function assumes that the input lists `L` and `R` are already sorted and contain distinct integers, which is consistent with the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
- The function appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- The conditions and loops are designed to handle the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
