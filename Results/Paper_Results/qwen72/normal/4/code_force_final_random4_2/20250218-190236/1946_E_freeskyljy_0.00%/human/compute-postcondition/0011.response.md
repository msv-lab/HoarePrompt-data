Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the three integers provided by the input, and `R` is a list of integers provided by the input. The function still takes three parameters: `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, where `n` is the length of the permutation, and `m1` and `m2` are the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2` must satisfy 1 ≤ `m1`, `m2` ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lists `p` and `s` must contain distinct integers within the range [1, `n`] and must be sorted in increasing order. `L` is a list of integers provided by the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.**
