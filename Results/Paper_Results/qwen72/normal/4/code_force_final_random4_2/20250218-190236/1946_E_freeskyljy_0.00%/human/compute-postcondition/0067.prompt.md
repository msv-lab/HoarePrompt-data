You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, m1, and m2, where n is the length of the permutation, and m1 and m2 are the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, it should take two lists of integers, p and s, where p contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and s contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The values of n, m1, and m2 must satisfy 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lists p and s must contain distinct integers within the range [1, n] and must be sorted in increasing order.

    #State: `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged. `nums_left` is updated to `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is 1.

If `M2` is not greater than 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2` if `M1` is not greater than 1; otherwise, `cur` is updated to `M1 - (L[-1] - 1)` or `M1 - 2` depending on the number of times the if condition was true. `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD` if `M2` is greater than 1. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s`, and returns 0 in Cases 1, 2, and 3. In Case 4, if `m2` is greater than 1, it returns the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]`, taken modulo `MOD`. If `m2` is not greater than 1, it returns `ans` updated to the product of all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]`, taken modulo `MOD`.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns 0.

Case_3: The program returns 0.

Case_4: The program returns `ans`, which is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD` if `M2` is greater than 1. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.
