Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`; `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2; `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`; `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`.** 

The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying the current value of `ans` by `nums_left` (which is `L[-1] - 2`) and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
