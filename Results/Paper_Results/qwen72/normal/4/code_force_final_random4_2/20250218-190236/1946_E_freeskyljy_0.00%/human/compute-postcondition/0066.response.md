The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s`. 

- `n` is the length of the permutation.
- `m1` is the number of prefix maximums.
- `m2` is the number of suffix maximums.
- `p` is a list of integers containing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order.
- `s` is a list of integers containing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order.

The values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2` must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lists `p` and `s` must contain distinct integers within the range [1, n] and must be sorted in increasing order.

The function returns:
- **Case_1**: 0.
- **Case_2**: 0.
- **Case_3**: 0.
- **Case_4**: If `m2` is greater than 1, the function returns `ans`, which is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD`. If `m2` is not greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s`, and returns 0 in Cases 1, 2, and 3. In Case 4, if `m2` is greater than 1, it returns the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]`, taken modulo `MOD`. If `m2` is not greater than 1, it returns `ans` updated to the product of all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]`, taken modulo `MOD`.**
