Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged; `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 4`. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**
