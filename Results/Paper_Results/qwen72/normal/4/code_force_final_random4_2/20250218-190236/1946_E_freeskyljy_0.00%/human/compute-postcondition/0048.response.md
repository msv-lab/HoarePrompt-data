Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is `R[0] + 1`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is updated to 2, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` remains 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD`.***
