Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged; `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 5` if the if part is executed, or `cur` is `M1 - 4` if the else part is executed. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD` if the if part is executed, or `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD` and `nums_left` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is further updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD` if the else part is executed. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `nums_left` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, `i`, `cur`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, except for the specific conditions that might affect `cur` and `ans` based on the value of `i` and `L[cur]`. The initial condition that `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
