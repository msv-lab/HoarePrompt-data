The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`; `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2**
