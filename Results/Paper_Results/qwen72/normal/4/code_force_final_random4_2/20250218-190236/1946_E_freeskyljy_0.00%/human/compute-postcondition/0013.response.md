Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is assigned the value of `M1 - 2`.
- The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The conditions in the initial state (such as `L[0]` being 1, `R[0]` being `N`, the last element of `L` being equal to the first element of `R`, and the specific values of `M1` and `M2`) remain valid.
