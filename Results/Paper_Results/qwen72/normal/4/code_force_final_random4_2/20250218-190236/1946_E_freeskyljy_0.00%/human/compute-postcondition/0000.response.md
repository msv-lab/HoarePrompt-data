Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the three integers provided by the input, and the function should still take three parameters: `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, where `n` is the length of the permutation, and `m1` and `m2` are the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. The values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2` must satisfy 1 ≤ `m1`, `m2` ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lists `p` and `s` must contain distinct integers within the range [1, `n`] and must be sorted in increasing order.**
