Output State: **`N` is greater than `R[0] + 3`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[0] + 3`, `cur` remains 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`.** 

The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `nums_left`, `i`, `cur`, and the conditions for `N` and the unchanged variables `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain the same.
