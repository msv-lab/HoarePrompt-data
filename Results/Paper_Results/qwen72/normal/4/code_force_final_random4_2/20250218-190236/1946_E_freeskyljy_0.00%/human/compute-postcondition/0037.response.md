Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - (L[-1] - 1)` or `M1 - 2` depending on the number of times the if condition was true; `nums_left` is 1; `i` is 1; `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged:** These variables are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
- **`cur` is `M1 - (L[-1] - 1)` or `M1 - 2`:** The value of `cur` depends on how many times the if condition (`i == L[cur]`) was true. If it was true for every iteration, `cur` would decrement by `L[-1] - 2` (since the loop runs `L[-1] - 2` times). If it was never true, `cur` would remain `M1 - 2`.
- **`nums_left` is 1:** The variable `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. After `L[-1] - 2` iterations, `nums_left` will be 1.
- **`i` is 1:** The variable `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1` and is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. After `L[-1] - 2` iterations, `i` will be 1.
- **`ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`:** The variable `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which starts at `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 each iteration) and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.
