Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums_left = L[-1] - 2` assigns the value of the last element in the list `L` minus 2 to the variable `nums_left`. Since the initial state specifies that `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `cur` is `M1 - 2`, the only new information is the value of `nums_left`. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the new value of `nums_left`.
