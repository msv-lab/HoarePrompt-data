Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged; `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 5` if the if part is executed, or `cur` is `M1 - 4` if the else part is executed. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD` if the if part is executed, or `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD` and `nums_left` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is further updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD` if the else part is executed.**
