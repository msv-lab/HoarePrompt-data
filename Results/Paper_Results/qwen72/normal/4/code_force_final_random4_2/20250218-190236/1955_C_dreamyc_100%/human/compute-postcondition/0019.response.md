The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` still hold true. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2]`, `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2]`, `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.**
