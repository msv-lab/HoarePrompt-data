Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and the sinking of ships. The logic in `func_1` is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sunk Ships**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of ships sunk by summing the durability of the first and last ships and comparing these sums to `a` and `b`. However, this approach does not correctly account for the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
   - The variables `s_a` and `s_b` are used to sum the durability of the first and last ships, respectively, but the program does not handle the case where a ship's durability drops to zero and it should no longer be attacked.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Ship Sinking**:
   - The program does not remove ships from the list once they sink. Instead, it continues to include them in the sums, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Alternating Attacks**:
   - The program does not properly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships. It should use a queue or deque to manage the ships and their positions, removing ships that have sunk.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = deque(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    sunk_count = 0
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
                sunk_count += 1
        k -= 1

        # Attack the last ship if there are still attacks left and ships remaining
        if k > 0 and nums:
            nums[-1] -= 1
            if nums[-1] == 0:
                nums.pop()
                sunk_count += 1
        k -= 1

    return sunk_count
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read and split into the number of test cases, the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function uses a deque to manage the ships, allowing efficient removal of ships from both ends.
   - The while loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and ships remaining (`nums` is not empty).
   - The first ship is attacked by decrementing its durability. If its durability drops to zero, it is removed from the deque and the sunk count is incremented.
   - The last ship is similarly attacked, and if its durability drops to zero, it is removed from the deque and the sunk count is incremented.
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships.

This corrected version accurately simulates the Kraken's attacks and correctly counts the number of sunk ships.
