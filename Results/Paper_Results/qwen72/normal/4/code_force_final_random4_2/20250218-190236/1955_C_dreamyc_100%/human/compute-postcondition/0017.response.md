Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1]`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, the condition `s_b <= b` holds true.**
