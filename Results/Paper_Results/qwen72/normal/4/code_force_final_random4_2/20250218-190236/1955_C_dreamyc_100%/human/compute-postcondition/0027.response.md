Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 3]`, and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
