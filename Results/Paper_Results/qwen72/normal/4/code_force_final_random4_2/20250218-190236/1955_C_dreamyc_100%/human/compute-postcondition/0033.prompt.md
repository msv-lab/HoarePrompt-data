You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.
    #State: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9). Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `nums`, and `ans` is the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, a positive integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` positive integers. It can return either the number of elements in the list `nums` (Case_1), or the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution (Case_2).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.

Case_2: The program returns the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
