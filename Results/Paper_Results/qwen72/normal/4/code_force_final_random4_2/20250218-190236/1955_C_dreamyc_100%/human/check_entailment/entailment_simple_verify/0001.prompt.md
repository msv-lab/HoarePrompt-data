You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships will sink. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships using `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of attacks on the first ship and `b` is the number of attacks on the last ship. This is done using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - It also initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to 0, which will accumulate the total durability of the ships from the front and back respectively.

4. **Loop Through Ships**:
   - The program iterates through the list of ships from both ends simultaneously.
   - For each ship, it adds the durability to `s_a` and `s_b`.
   - If `s_a` (the accumulated durability from the front) is less than or equal to `a` (the number of attacks on the front), it increments `ans` by 1.
   - If `s_b` (the accumulated durability from the back) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of attacks on the back), it increments `ans` by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Overcounting**: The program may overcount the number of ships sunk. For example, if a ship is attacked both from the front and the back, it will be counted twice in `ans`. This is incorrect because a ship can only be sunk once.
- **Incorrect Logic for Simultaneous Attacks**: The logic for determining which ships are sunk is flawed. The program should simulate the attacks in the correct order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and keep track of the remaining durabilities of the ships.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
To correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, we need to use a more detailed approach. We can use a deque to simulate the ships and their durabilities, and then perform the attacks in the specified order.

```python
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ships.popleft()
                sunk += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
        
        # Attack the last ship
        if ships and ships[-1] > 0:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
                sunk += 1
            k -= 1
    
    return sunk
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Deque Initialization**: We use a deque to store the ship durabilities, which allows efficient popping from both ends.
- **While Loop**: The loop continues until either all attacks are performed (`k == 0`) or all ships have sunk (`ships` is empty).
- **First Ship Attack**: We decrement the durability of the first ship. If it sinks, we remove it from the deque and increment the `sunk` counter.
- **Last Ship Attack**: We decrement the durability of the last ship. If it sinks, we remove it from the deque and increment the `sunk` counter.
- **Break Condition**: If `k` becomes 0, we break out of the loop to avoid unnecessary operations.
- **Return**: Finally, we return the number of ships sunk.

This corrected program accurately simulates the Kraken's attacks and correctly counts the number of ships sunk.
