Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first `st` elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `l` or `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r - 1]`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `le - max(st, end)`.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`.
- `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1.
- `max(st, end)` will be the larger of `st` and `end`.
- Therefore, `ans` is the difference between the length of the list `a` and the maximum of `st` and `end`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
