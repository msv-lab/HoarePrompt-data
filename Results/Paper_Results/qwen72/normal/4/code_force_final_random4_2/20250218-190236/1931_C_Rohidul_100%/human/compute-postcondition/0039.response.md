Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the first element of `a` must be equal to the second element of `a`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st + 1`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`**

Explanation:
- `st` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `2`.
- The condition `n > st` now becomes `n > 2` since `st` is now `2`.
- The value of `ans` is recalculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`, which is `max(0, le - 3)`.
- All other variables (`a`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `end`) remain unchanged.
