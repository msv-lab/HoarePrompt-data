Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first two elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1**

The variable `st` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
