Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first `st` elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `l` or `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r - 1]`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer.
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0 and `n > st`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `n`.
