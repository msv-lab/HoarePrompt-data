Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first `st` elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `l` or `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r - 1]`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the elements `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are equal.
- After all iterations, `r` will either be equal to `l` (which is `st - 1`) or it will be the largest index where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- The variable `end` will be the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1, because `end` starts at 1 and increments each time the loop runs.
- The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `le`, and `st`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
