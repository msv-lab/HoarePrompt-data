Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array for each test case. The length of each inner list n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        le = len(a)
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 1, 1
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided initially. For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` have been updated according to the logic of the loop. Specifically, for each test case, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is the list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the result of the computation `le - max(st, end)` unless the first and last elements of `a` are equal, in which case `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. The final output for each test case is the value of `ans`.
