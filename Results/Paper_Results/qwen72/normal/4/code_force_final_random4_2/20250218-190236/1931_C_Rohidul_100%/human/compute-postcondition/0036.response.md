Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `st` and `end` are both set to 1.
- The initial state variables `a`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `le`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n > st` is still valid because `st` is now 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- The value of `ans` is recalculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`, but the expression `st + end` is now 2.
- If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - 2)`.
