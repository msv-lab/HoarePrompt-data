Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 1, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
