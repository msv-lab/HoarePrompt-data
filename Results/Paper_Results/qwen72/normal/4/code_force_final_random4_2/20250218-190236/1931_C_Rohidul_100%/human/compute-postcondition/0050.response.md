To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```

The loop will continue to execute if both conditions are true:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The first `st` elements of `a` are all equal.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element.
- `r` is `n - 2`.
- `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal.
- `end` is 2.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- `r` must be greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Given that `r` is `n - 2` and `n > st`, `r` is already less than `n` and greater than `l` (since `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous element, and `r` is `n - 2` which is greater than `l`).

The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also hold true. Since `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` at the end of the previous iteration, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is 2, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**
