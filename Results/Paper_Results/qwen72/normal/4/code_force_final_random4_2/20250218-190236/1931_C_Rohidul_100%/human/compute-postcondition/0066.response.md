Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`.**

The variables `l` and `r` have been updated. `l` is now 0, and `r` is now `n - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
