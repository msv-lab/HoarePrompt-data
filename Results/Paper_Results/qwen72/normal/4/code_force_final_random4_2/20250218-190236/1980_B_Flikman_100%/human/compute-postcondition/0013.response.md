Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1. If the first element of `sorted_a` (i.e., `sorted_a[0]`) is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 2. If the first element of `sorted_a` is not equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 1.***
