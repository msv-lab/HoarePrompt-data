The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `a`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
