Postcondition: ***If the program is executed as the main module, `max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user for the last test case, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with `m` elements, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` (either the first or last element of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`), `tp1` is `m` or `0` (depending on the final state of the loop), and `tp2` is `-1` or `m - 1` (depending on the final state of the loop). If the program is not executed as the main module, no changes are made to the variables.***
