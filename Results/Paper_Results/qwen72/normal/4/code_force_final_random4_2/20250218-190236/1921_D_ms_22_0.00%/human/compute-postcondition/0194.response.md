Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the absolute difference between the element `i` from `a` and either the first or last element of `b` (depending on which difference is larger), `index` is either 0 or `m - 1` (again depending on which difference is larger). `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is as follows: The `max_heap` list contains `n` tuples, where each tuple represents the largest absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in the sorted list `b`. The tuples are in the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the absolute difference, `i` is the element from `a`, and `index` is either 0 or `m - 1` depending on whether the difference with the first or last element in `b` is larger. The variables `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2` remain unchanged at 0, 0, and `m - 1` respectively. The variable `t` is updated to `t - n - 1`, and it must still be greater than 0. The variables `n` and `m` retain their initial values, and `a` and `b` remain as the lists provided by the user, with `a` having `n` elements and `b` being a sorted list.
