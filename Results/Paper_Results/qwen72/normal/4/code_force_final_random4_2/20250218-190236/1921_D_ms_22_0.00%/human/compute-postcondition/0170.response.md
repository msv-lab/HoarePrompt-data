Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is the final index of the first element in `b` that was considered, `tp2` is the final index of the last element in `b` that was considered, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `max_heap = []` reinitializes the `max_heap` to an empty list, but does not affect the other variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the `max_heap` variable.
