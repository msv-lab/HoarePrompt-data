The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into the `max_heap` list. The `max_heap` is a heap where the largest element is at the root (since we are using negative values for the first element of the tuple).

- `max_heap` was initially an empty list and now contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `tp1` remains 0.
- `tp2` remains `m - 1`.
- `t` remains `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` and `m` are still integers provided by the user.
- `a` is still a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
- `b` is still a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is still the first element of `a`.
- `diff1` is still the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.
- `diff2` is still the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.
- `diff1` is still less than or equal to `diff2`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
