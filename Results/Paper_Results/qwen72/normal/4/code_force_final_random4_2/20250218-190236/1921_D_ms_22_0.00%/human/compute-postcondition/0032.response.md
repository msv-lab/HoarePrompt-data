Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. For each element `i` in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. For each element `i` in `a`, if `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is added to the max heap `max_heap`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is added to the max heap `max_heap`. The `max_heap` now contains `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
