Output State: **`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by the negative of the first element in the `item` tuple. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
