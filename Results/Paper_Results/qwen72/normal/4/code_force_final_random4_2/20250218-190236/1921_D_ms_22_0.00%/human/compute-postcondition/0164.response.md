The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the previous iteration.

State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is the final index of the first element in `b` that was considered, `tp2` is the final index of the last element in `b` that was considered, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` remain the integers provided by the user, `a` remains the list of integers provided by the user with `n` elements, and `b` remains the sorted list of integers provided by the user**
