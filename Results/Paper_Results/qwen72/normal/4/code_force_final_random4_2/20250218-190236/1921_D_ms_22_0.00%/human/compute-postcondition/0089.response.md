Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet initializes `max_heap` to an empty list, but does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
