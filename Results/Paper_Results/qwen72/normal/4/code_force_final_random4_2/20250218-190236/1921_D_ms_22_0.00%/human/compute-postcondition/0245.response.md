Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user for the last test case, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with `m` elements, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` (either the first or last element of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`), `tp1` is `m` or `0` (depending on the final state of the loop), and `tp2` is `-1` or `m - 1` (depending on the final state of the loop).**

### Explanation:
- **`max_heap`**: After each iteration of the loop, the `max_heap` is emptied as all elements are processed and popped out. Therefore, after the loop completes all iterations, `max_heap` will be an empty list.
- **`t`**: The loop decrements `t` by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` will be 0 after the loop completes.
- **`n` and `m`**: These variables are re-assigned at the beginning of each iteration based on the input for the current test case. After the loop completes, `n` and `m` will hold the values of the last test case.
- **`a` and `b`**: `a` and `b` are re-assigned at the beginning of each iteration based on the input for the current test case. After the loop completes, `a` will be the list of integers for the last test case, and `b` will be the sorted list of integers for the last test case.
- **`ans`**: `ans` is calculated for each test case and printed. After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the final sum of the absolute differences for the last test case.
- **`tp1` and `tp2`**: These variables are adjusted during the loop to track the range of elements in `b` that are being considered. After the loop completes, `tp1` will be either `m` or `0` (depending on whether the loop has considered all elements from the start or not), and `tp2` will be either `-1` or `m - 1` (depending on whether the loop has considered all elements from the end or not).
