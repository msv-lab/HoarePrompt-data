To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `t > 0`. Given the state right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This means `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0, as the minimum value it can take is 1.

Since the condition `t > 0` is already satisfied by the given state, no adjustments are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **t is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module.**
