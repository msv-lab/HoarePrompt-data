Output State: **`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`.**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding `diff2` to it. The values of `max_heap`, `item`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `diff1`, and `tp2` are unchanged, except for `tp2` which is decremented by 1. The new value of `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `diff2`.
