Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`, which is `-item[0]` since `item[0]` is a negative value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
