You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to the initial value of `n`, and `i` is equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` which represent the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO" because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is correct because any cut parallel to one of the sides will result in at least one non-integer dimension.

3. **Equal Halves Check**: The program checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (i.e., `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`). If this condition is true, it prints "NO". This is because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, the resulting rectangles will be identical to the original rectangle when reassembled, and thus no new rectangle can be formed. This check is also correct.

4. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This is because if one of the dimensions is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. For example, a 2 \times 6 rectangle can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 4 \times 3 rectangle.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs "NO" and "YES" in uppercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

However, there is a minor issue with the program:

- **Division Operator**: In Python, the `/` operator performs floating-point division. For integer division, the `//` operator should be used. This is important because the condition `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` might not work as expected if `a` or `b` are odd, as it will result in a floating-point number. For example, `3 / 2` results in `1.5`, which is not equal to any integer.

To fix this, the conditions should be changed to use integer division:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

With this fix, the program will correctly handle all cases.

Correctness: **False** (due to the floating-point division issue)
