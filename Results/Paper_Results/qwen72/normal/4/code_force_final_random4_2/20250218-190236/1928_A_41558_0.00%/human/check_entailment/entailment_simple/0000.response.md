### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` which represent the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Logic for Determining if Another Rectangle Can Be Formed**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - The program then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' because the resulting rectangle after cutting would be the same as the original rectangle (considering rotations).
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES' because Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where both `a` and `b` are 1, which is the smallest possible rectangle and cannot be cut.
   - It also handles the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is any odd number, which cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Correctness:
The program logic is correct and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
