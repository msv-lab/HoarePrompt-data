The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
