Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even. For example, for the input `4 4`, the program will output `YES`, but the correct output should be `NO` because cutting a 4x4 rectangle into two 2x4 rectangles and then forming a 4x4 rectangle again does not result in a different rectangle. According to the problem description, the output should be `NO` if the resulting rectangle is the same as the original one, even if it can be formed by cutting and reassembling.
