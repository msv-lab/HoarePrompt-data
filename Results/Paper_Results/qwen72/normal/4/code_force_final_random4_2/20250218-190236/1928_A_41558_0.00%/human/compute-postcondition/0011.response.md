Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` and `b` remain odd. Otherwise, either `a` is even, `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are even. If `a` is exactly half of `b` or `b` is exactly half of `a`, this condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.***
