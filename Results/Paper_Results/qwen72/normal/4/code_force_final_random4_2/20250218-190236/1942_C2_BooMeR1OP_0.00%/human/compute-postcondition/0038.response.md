Output State: **`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 2, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`. `gaps` now contains the value `next_elem - a[2] - 1` as its last element, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. `next_elem` is `a[3] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[3]`.**
