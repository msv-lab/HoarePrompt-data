Output State: **`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`, plus `2 * y`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of `next_elem - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1` where `gap` is greater than 0, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `y` is less than `pairs`.**
