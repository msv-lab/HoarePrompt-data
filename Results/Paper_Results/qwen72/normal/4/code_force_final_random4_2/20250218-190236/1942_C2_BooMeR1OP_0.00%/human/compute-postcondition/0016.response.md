Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2` if `t1` is in `present` or `t2` is not in `present`, or `ans` is `x` if neither condition is met.***
