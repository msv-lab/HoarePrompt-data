### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, but the function definition itself is not complete. However, the function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of vertices `a` chosen by Bessie.
   - The vertices are adjusted by decrementing each by 1 and then sorted. This is a valid step to ensure the vertices are in a consistent order for further processing.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because each chosen vertex can form a triangle with two other vertices, and since Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, the initial number of triangles is `x - 2`.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the chosen vertices and checks if the next vertex (i.e., `t1` and `t2`) can form a triangle. Specifically, it checks if the vertex immediately after the current vertex (`t1`) is not already chosen and the vertex two steps after the current vertex (`t2`) is chosen. If this condition is true, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - This step is intended to count the number of triangles that can be formed by the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. These gaps represent the number of vertices that can be added between the chosen vertices to form more triangles.
   - The gaps are stored in a list and then sorted. This is a valid step to ensure that the smallest gaps are considered first when adding new vertices.

5. **Adding New Vertices:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted gaps and calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added to form new triangles. The number of pairs is given by `gap // 2`.
   - If the number of pairs is less than or equal to `y`, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If the number of pairs is greater than `y`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop, as no more vertices can be added.

6. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the vertices to calculate the maximum number of triangular pieces.
- The logic for counting the initial triangles and the additional triangles by adding new vertices is sound and follows the problem constraints.
- The program ensures that the number of additional vertices added does not exceed `y`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the polygon with `n` sides, given the vertices Bessie has already chosen.
