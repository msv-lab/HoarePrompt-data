The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` or `y`, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of `next_elem - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1` where `gap` is greater than 0, `gap` is the third element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, `ans` is now `ans + 2 * y`.**
