Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`, `gaps` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 0:
        gaps.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing the value `next_elem - a[0] - 1` if `gap` is greater than 0, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[1] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains the value `next_elem - a[1] - 1` as the last element. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list. `next_elem` is `a[2] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[2]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 2, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` contains the value `next_elem - a[2] - 1` as its last element, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list. `next_elem` is `a[3] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
