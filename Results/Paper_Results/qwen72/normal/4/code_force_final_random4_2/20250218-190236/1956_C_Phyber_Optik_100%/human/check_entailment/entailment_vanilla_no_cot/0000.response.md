Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix elements as described in the problem statement. The logic for calculating the maximum sum `sum` is flawed. The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be a value from 1 to \( n \), is actually \( n^2 \times n \) because each element can be set to \( n \), the highest value in the permutation, and there are \( n^2 \) elements in total.

Additionally, the operations performed do not necessarily maximize the sum. The operations simply fill the matrix with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \) for each row and column, which does not ensure that the maximum possible value is used for each element.

A correct approach would be to perform operations that set each row and each column to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) or \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), ensuring that the highest values are used as much as possible. However, since the problem specifies that the maximum sum can be achieved with no more than \( 2n \) operations, a simpler and more effective solution is to perform \( n \) type 1 operations (filling each row with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\)) and \( n \) type 2 operations (filling each column with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\)). This will ensure that each element in the matrix is set to the highest possible value, \( n \), and the sum will be \( n^3 \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations to achieve it, ensuring that the sum is \( n^3 \) and the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).
