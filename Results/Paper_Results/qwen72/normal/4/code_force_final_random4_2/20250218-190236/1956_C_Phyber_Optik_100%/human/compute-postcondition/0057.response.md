The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `j` is 2**
