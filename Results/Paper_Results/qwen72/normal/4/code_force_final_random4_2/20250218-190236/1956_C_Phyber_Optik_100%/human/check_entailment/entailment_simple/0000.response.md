### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Matrix Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values. Since the values are from \( 1 \) to \( n \), the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which is the sum of all numbers from \( 1 \) to \( n \) multiplied by \( n \times n \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `sum` to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( n \) and updates `sum` using the formula \( \text{sum} += (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \).
   - This formula simplifies to \( \text{sum} += (2i - 1) \cdot i \), which is \( 2i^2 - i \).
   - The total sum calculated by the program is \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).

4. **Correctness of Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n \times n \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
   - The program's sum calculation does not match the expected maximum sum.

5. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations for each test case, which is within the allowed limit.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - These operations will fill the matrix with the values \( 1 \) to \( n \) in each row and column, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the sum calculation does not match the expected maximum sum. The operations themselves are valid and will fill the matrix correctly, but the sum output is wrong.

### Correctness:
**False**
