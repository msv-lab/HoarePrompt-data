The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range parameters `2` and `n + 1`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted, but it must remain greater than 0 as per the initial state. The variable `sum` is also not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted, but it must remain 1 as per the initial state.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1**
