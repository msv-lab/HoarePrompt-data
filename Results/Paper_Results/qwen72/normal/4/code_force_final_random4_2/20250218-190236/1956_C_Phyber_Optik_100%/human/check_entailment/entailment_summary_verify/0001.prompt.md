You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and calculates a sum based on a specific formula. It then prints the sum followed by `2n`. Additionally, for each value from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines: the first line starts with `1` followed by `n - j + 1` and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line starts with `2` followed by `n - j + 1` and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0, and the final state for each test case includes the calculated sum and the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values in each cell.
   - The maximum value in a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum of the matrix is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations to Achieve the Maximum Sum:**
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we need to fill each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This can be done by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column), totaling \( 2n \) operations.
   - The program should output the maximum sum \( n^3 \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).

4. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
   - It prints the sum and \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
   - It then prints \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Correctness of the Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the program is \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - The sum of \( 2i^2 \) from \( i=2 \) to \( n \) is:
     \[
     2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = 2 \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 - 1 \right) = 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - The sum of \( i \) from \( i=2 \) to \( n \) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i - 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Combining these, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - This is not equal to \( n^3 \), which is the correct maximum sum.

6. **Correctness of the Operations:**
   - The program correctly prints \( 2n \) operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - However, the sum calculation is incorrect.

Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the sum calculation does not match the expected maximum sum \( n^3 \).
