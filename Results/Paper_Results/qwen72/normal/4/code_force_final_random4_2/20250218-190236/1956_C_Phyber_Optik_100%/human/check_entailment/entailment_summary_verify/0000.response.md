### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the sum in the program is:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
   - This formula can be simplified as:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \cdot (i^2 - (i-1)^2)
     \]
   - Further simplification:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \cdot (2i - 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - The sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
     \]
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Substituting back:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n+2 - 3)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}
     \]
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 7 \), which matches the problem description.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program prints `2n` operations for each test case.
   - For \( n = 1 \), it prints `2` operations, which is incorrect as it should be `1` or `0`.
   - For \( n = 2 \), it prints `4` operations, which is incorrect as it should be `3`.

3. **Operations Sequence**:
   - The program generates the same permutation for each row and column operation.
   - For \( n = 2 \), the correct sequence of operations should be:
     ```
     7 3
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - The program generates:
     ```
     7 4
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - This sequence does not maximize the sum to `7` as required.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the number of operations for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \). Additionally, the sequence of operations generated for \( n = 2 \) does not maximize the sum to `7` as required by the problem description.

Final: **False**
