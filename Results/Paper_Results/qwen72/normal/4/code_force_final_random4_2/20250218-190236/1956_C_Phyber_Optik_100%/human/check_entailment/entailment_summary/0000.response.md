Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the matrix after performing the operations. The formula used in the program is:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the sum:
   \[
   i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
   \]
   Therefore, the formula becomes:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} 2i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
   \]
   Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   We can rewrite the sum as:
   \[
   \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1
   \]
   \[
   \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
   \]
   Substituting these into the sum formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n+2 - 3)}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
   \]
   This formula is correct for the maximum sum of the matrix.

2. **Operation Count**: The program prints `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of 2n operations.

3. **Operation Details**: For each `j` from 1 to `n`, the program prints:
   - A type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - A type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   These operations ensure that every element in the matrix is set to a value between 1 and n, and the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of both the sum calculation and the operations performed.
