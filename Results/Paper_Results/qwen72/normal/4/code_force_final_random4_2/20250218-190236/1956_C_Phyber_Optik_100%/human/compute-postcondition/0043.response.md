The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`**
