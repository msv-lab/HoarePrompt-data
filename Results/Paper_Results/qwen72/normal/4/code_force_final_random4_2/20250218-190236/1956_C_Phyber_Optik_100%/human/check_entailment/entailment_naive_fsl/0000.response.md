Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the sum is flawed. For example, when `n = 1`, the maximum sum should be `1`, but the program will output `1` for the sum and `2` for the number of operations, which is incorrect because the number of operations should be `1` or `0` for a 1x1 matrix.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n = 2` correctly. According to the problem description, the maximum sum for a 2x2 matrix should be `7`, and the program should output a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. However, the program will output `7` as the sum but will not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The operations it generates will set each row and column to the same permutation, which does not maximize the sum as intended.

For `n = 2`, the correct output should be:
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
But the program will output:
```
7 4
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This sequence of operations does not maximize the sum to `7` as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
