The code snippet updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `i` is 3.
2. `i * i` is `3 * 3` which equals 9.
3. `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `(3 - 1) * (3 - 1)` which equals `2 * 2` which is 4.
4. `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `9 - 4` which equals 5.
5. `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is `5 * 3` which equals 15.
6. `sum` is initially 7, so `sum += 15` results in `sum` being 22.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 22, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`.**
