Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
   - `i` is \(n + 1\).
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Print Statement:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Calculating the Values:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 1`.
   - The third part of the print statement unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be: `1`, `n - 1`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the final output is:

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the range from 1 to n is the sequence of integers from 1 to n)**
