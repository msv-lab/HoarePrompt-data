To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop head specifies that `i` starts at 2 and iterates up to `n + 1`. The initial state given is `i` is \(\text{previous\_n} + 1\). For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 2, so we need to adjust `i` to 2.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. The initial state given is `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `sum`, and `j` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the initial state, so we should include them in the final state.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**
