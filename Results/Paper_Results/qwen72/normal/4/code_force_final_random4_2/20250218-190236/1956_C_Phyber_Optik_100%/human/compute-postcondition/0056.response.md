Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is defined as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
   - `i` is \(n + 1\).
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means it will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the numbers from 1 to n are the elements of the range from 1 to n)**
