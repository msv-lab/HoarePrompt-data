Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `sum` is \( n^3 \) (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
- `i` is `n + 1` (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
- `j` is 3.

### Print Statement:
```
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant integer value. It will be printed as `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `j` is 3.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - Since `n` is at least 3, `n - 2` will be at least 1.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n` is 3:
  - `n - j + 1` is `3 - 3 + 1` which is `1`.
  - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 4)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The print statement will output: `2, 1, 1, 2, 3`.

- If `n` is 4:
  - `n - j + 1` is `4 - 3 + 1` which is `2`.
  - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 5)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - The print statement will output: `2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4`.

### General Output:
- The first element printed will always be `2`.
- The second element printed will be `n - 2`.
- The remaining elements will be the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n)**
