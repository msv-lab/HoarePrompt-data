### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem requirements to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Maximize the Sum of the Matrix:**
   - For a given \( n \times n \) matrix, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column.

2. **Operations:**
   - Type 1 operation: Assign a permutation to a row.
   - Type 2 operation: Assign a permutation to a column.
   - The solution should use no more than \( 2n \) operations.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - Then, output the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the size of the matrix \( n \) for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( n \) and updates the sum using the formula: \( \text{sum} += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i \).
   - This formula simplifies to \( \text{sum} += (2i - 1) * i \), which is equivalent to \( \text{sum} += 2i^2 - i \).

3. **Output of Sum and Operations:**
   - The program outputs the calculated sum and \( 2n \) as the number of operations.
   - It then generates \( 2n \) operations: \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - Each operation sets a row or column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in each row and column is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} p_j \), where \( p_j \) is the permutation.
   - For a permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), the sum of each row is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Therefore, the total sum for the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - However, the operations are not correct for achieving the maximum sum.

3. **Operations Generation:**
   - The program generates \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This does not maximize the sum as required. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the correct sequence of operations should be:
     ```
     7 3
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     7 4
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - This sequence does not achieve the maximum sum of 7.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum for all potential cases, and it does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. Specifically, the sum calculation is flawed, and the operations do not maximize the sum as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
