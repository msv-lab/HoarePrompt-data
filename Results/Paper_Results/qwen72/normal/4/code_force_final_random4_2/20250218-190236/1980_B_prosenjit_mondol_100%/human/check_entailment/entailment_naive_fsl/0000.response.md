Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the favorite cube is removed. Specifically, the condition `if a[k] > x:` should be `if a[k] < x:` to correctly determine if the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes after sorting. However, the main issue is in the `else` block where the program incorrectly assumes that if `a[k] == x`, the favorite cube will always be removed. This is not necessarily true, as the favorite cube could be in any position among the cubes with the same value as `x`.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this example, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting the array in non-increasing order, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube could end up in the second position, which means it will be removed, or it could end up in the third position, which means it will not be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE", but the program outputs "YES". This indicates that the program does not handle this case correctly.
