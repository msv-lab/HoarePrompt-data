Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the final conditional check. Specifically, the condition `if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE'` is incorrect. The condition `k == n - 1` is checking if `k` is the last index of the sorted list, which is not the correct condition to determine if the favorite cube will be removed or not. Instead, the program should check if the favorite cube's value is among the first `k` values in the sorted list.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if x < a[k]:
            print('NO')
        elif x > a[k]:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # Check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes in the sorted list
            if a[:k+1].count(x) > a[k+1:].count(x):
                print('YES')
            elif a[:k+1].count(x) < a[k+1:].count(x):
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Index Adjustment**: The index `f` is adjusted to be 0-based for easier list access.
3. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.
4. **Value Comparison**:
   - If the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list, it will not be removed.
   - If the value of the favorite cube `x` is greater than the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list, it will be removed.
   - If the value of the favorite cube `x` is equal to the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list, further checks are needed:
     - If the count of `x` in the first `k+1` cubes is greater than the count of `x` in the remaining cubes, the favorite cube will be removed.
     - If the count of `x` in the first `k+1` cubes is less than the count of `x` in the remaining cubes, the favorite cube will not be removed.
     - If the counts are equal, it is ambiguous, and the output should be "MAYBE".

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
