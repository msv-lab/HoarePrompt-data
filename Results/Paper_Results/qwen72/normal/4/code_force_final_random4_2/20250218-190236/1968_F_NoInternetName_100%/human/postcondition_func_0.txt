The function `func_1` accepts a callable `cast` and returns an iterator. This iterator applies the `cast` function to each element in a list of strings obtained by splitting a line of input provided by the user. The final state of the program is that it has an iterator where each element is the result of converting a string from the input to the specific type defined by `cast`.
