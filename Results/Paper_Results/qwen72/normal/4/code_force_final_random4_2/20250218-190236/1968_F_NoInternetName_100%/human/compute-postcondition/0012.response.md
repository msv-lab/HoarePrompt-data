Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended which is the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` appended to its list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The list `a` remains a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 0 and 2^30 - 1.
- The variable `i` is still the third element of `a`.
- The list `x` now has a new element appended, which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i` (where `x[-1]` was previously the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1]`).
- The dictionary `inds` is updated to include the index `len(x) - 1` for the new element in `x`.
