Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`.
2. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
4. `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
5. `q` must be greater than 0.
6. `i` is 0.
7. `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. The element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `x`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `x` is a list where `x[0]` is 0 (since the cumulative XOR of an empty list is 0), and for each subsequent index `i` in `x`, `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`.

2. **Dictionary `inds`**:
   - `inds` is a defaultdict that maps each unique value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`.

3. **Function `func_1(int)`**:
   - The function `func_1(int)` returns two values, `l` and `r`.
   - The precondition states that the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.

4. **Condition**:
   - The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is explicitly stated to be true.
   - This means that the cumulative XOR up to index `l - 1` is the same as the cumulative XOR up to index `r`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is true, the print statement will execute and print 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
