### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` is used to read and convert input values. It is called twice in `func_5` to read the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, and then to read the elements of the array and the queries themselves.
   - This function is correctly implemented and used, ensuring that the input is properly parsed and converted to integers.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation (`func_5`)**:
   - The function `func_5` calculates the cumulative XOR of the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`. This is done by iterating through the array and updating the cumulative XOR at each step.
   - The dictionary `inds` is used to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears. This is crucial for efficiently checking the conditions for the queries.

3. **Query Processing (`func_5`)**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the function checks if the cumulative XOR up to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to `r`. If they are equal, it means the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into segments where the XOR of each segment is zero, which satisfies the condition of being interesting.
   - If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, the function uses binary search (via `func_2` and `func_3`) to find the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` and the smallest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there is a valid split point where the XOR of the segments can be equal, and the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`)**:
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index in `arr` where the predicate is `True`.
   - `func_3` is a wrapper around `func_2` and behaves identically.
   - `func_4` adjusts the result of `func_2` by adding 1 if the result is not `None`.
   - These functions are used to efficiently find the required indices in the `inds` dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. The use of cumulative XOR and binary search ensures that the queries are processed efficiently and accurately.

**Correctness: True**
