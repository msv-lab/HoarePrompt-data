Let's break down the initial state and the logic leading to the `print` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
   - `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.
   - `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is constructed such that `x[0]` is 0 (since the cumulative XOR of an empty list is 0), and `x[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) is the cumulative XOR of `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`.
   - `inds` maps each element in `x` to a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `l` and `r` are indices returned by `func_1(int)`, which we assume are valid indices within the bounds of `x`.
   - `lower` is determined by looking for the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`. If no such index exists, `lower` is 0.
   - `upper` is determined by looking for the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If no such index exists, `upper` is 0.
   - The condition `upper` is less than or equal to `lower` is given.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'No'`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` because the condition `upper` is less than or equal to `lower` is explicitly stated. This condition ensures that the `print` statement will always execute with the same output regardless of the specific values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper`.

Output: **No**
