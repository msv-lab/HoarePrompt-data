The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and a series of `q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). It computes a cumulative XOR list `x` of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point. It also maintains a dictionary `inds` where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`. For each query, the function checks if the cumulative XOR from the start up to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to `r`. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` and the smallest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value.
