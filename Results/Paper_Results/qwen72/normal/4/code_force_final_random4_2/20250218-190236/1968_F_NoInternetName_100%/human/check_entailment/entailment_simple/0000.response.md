### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a` and initializes the cumulative XOR list `x` and a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each cumulative XOR value.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the cumulative XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`.
   - It also correctly updates the dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting.
   - The first check `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` is correct because if the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is the same as the cumulative XOR from the start to `r`, the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` has a cumulative XOR of 0, which means it can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - If the first check fails, the program uses binary search to find the indices `lower` and `upper` in the list of indices where the cumulative XOR values `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` appear.
   - The binary search is implemented using `func_2` and `func_4`, which are designed to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the cumulative XOR values appear.
   - The final check `if upper > lower` is correct because if there is an index `upper` greater than `lower` where the cumulative XOR values match, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

4. **Binary Search Functions**:
   - `func_2` and `func_4` are used to perform binary search on the list of indices.
   - `func_2` finds the largest index where the predicate is `True`.
   - `func_4` finds the largest index where the predicate is `True` and returns it plus 1 if it exists, otherwise returns `None`.
   - These functions are correctly implemented and used in the query processing.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the subarray has a cumulative XOR of 0 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR values correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
