Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the `continue` statement has been executed, and the loop or conditional block will proceed to the next iteration or step.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `upper` using the expression `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`.
- `inds[x[l - 1]]` is a list of indices where the element `x[l - 1]` appears in `x`.
- `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` is a function that returns the index of the last element in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
- Therefore, `upper` is now the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, if such an index exists. If no such index exists, `upper` remains 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
