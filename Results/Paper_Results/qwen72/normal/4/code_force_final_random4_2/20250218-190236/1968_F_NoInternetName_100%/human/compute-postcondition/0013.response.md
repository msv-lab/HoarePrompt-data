Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended which is the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` appended to its list.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, with `n` still being greater than 1, `a` still being a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 0 and 2^30, and `i` still being the third element of `a`. The list `x` has a new element appended, which is the result of the XOR operation between the second-to-last element of `x`, the second element of `a`, and `i`. The dictionary `inds` now has the key `x[-1]` (the last element of `x`), and the value associated with this key is a list that includes the index `len(x) - 1` appended to it.
