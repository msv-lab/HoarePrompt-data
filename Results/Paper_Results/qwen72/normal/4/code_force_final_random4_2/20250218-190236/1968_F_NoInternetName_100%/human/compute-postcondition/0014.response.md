Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The variable `n` must be equal to the length of the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, containing integers where each integer is between 0 and 2^30 - 1.
- The list `x` will have `n + 1` elements. The first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- The defaultdict `inds` will have keys that are the elements of `x`, and the value for each key is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`. Each index in `inds` corresponds to the position in `x` where the cumulative XOR value was appended.
