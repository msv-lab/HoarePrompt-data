Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least three keys, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
