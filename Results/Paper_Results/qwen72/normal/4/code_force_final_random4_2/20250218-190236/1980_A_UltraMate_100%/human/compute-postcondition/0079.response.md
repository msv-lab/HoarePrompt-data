Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least one key, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m` plus `m - hmp[i]`**. 

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the original value of `ans` (which is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m`) plus the difference between `m` and the frequency of the first key `i` in the `hmp` Counter object. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
