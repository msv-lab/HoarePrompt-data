Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEFG'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`. `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp` plus the sum of (`m` - `hmp[i]`) for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` < `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` multiplied by `m` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
