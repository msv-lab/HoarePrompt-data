t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, m, a) with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a being a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
