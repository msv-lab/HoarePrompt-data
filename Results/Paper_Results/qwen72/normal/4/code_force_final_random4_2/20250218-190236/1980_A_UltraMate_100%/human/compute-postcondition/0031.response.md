Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`. `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged, and the calculation for `ans` is still valid based on the updated values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `m` while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.
