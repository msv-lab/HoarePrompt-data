### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with cells containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the cell's character and the character is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`.
   - It is used to help compute the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.
   - It uses `pre` to store the positions of '>' characters.
   - `preOne` is a cumulative sum list of `pre` using `accumulate`.
   - `suffZero` is a list that keeps track of the cumulative sum of positions of '<' characters from the end of the string.
   - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating `ans` based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters and their cumulative sums.
   - The final result is printed as a list of integers.

4. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `pre` and `suffZero` helps in efficiently calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for updating `ans` based on the positions and cumulative sums is consistent with the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the string is entirely '<' or '>'.
   - It also handles cases where the string has a mix of '<' and '>' characters.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is O(n) because it processes each character in the string once.
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional lists `pre`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to compute the required times for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Correctness:
**True**
