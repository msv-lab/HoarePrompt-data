Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero`.
- `oneInd` is 2 times the result of the function `func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- `el` remains the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`.
- `suffZero` retains its new element appended, which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`.
- `ol` remains equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
