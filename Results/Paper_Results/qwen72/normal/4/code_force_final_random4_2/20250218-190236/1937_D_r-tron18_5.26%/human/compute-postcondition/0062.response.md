Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is preserved: `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, and `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`.
- The code snippet assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`.
- `ol` is now equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is now equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
