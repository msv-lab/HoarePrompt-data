Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation:
- The code `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` introduces a new variable `oneInd` and assigns it the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- The function `func_1(preOne, zr)` is called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. The specific value of `func_1(preOne, zr)` is not provided, so `oneInd` is expressed in terms of this function.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
