Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` that was processed, `totalOne` is `0`, `preOne` is an empty list, `suffZero` is a list with `n + 1` elements, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated based on the loop logic.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following changes occur:

- **`i`**: The loop counter `i` is `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations from `n - 1` down to `0`.
- **`el`**: The variable `el` holds the last character of `s1` that was processed during the loop.
- **`totalOne`**: The variable `totalOne` is `0`, as the loop decrements `totalOne` each time it encounters a '>' character, and all '>' characters have been processed.
- **`preOne`**: The list `preOne` is empty, as the loop removes the last element from `preOne` each time it encounters a '>' character, and all '>' characters have been processed.
- **`suffZero`**: The list `suffZero` now has `n + 1` elements. This is because for each '<' character encountered, a new element is appended to `suffZero`, and the loop processes all `n` characters in `s1`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated based on the logic within the loop. Each element in `ans` has been assigned a value according to the conditions and calculations specified in the loop body.

All other variables that were not modified within the loop head or body remain unchanged from their initial state.
