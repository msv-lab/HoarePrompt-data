Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.**

The value of `zeroInd` is now `2 * suffZero[-1]`, which is twice the last element in the `suffZero` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
