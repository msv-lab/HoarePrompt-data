Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `n - 3`.
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- The value of `el` remains the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`.
- The value of `suffZero` remains the same, with the new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`.
- The value of `ol` remains `totalOne`.
- The value of `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. The specific value of `zeroInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but the expression is as given.
