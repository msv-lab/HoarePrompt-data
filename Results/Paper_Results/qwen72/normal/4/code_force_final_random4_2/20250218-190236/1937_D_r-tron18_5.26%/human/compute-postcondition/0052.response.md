Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements in `suffZero`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as the sum of the last two elements in the list `suffZero`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
