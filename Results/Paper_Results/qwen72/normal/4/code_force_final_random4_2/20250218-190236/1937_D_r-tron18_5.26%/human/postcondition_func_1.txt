The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string and computes a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated, and this list is printed to the console.
