Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[i]` which is now `n + 1 - fi`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` using the expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
- `zeroInd` is 0.
- `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, which simplifies to `func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- Therefore, the expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` simplifies to `0 - func_1(preOne, 0) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0))`, which further simplifies to `n + 1 - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- The value of `ans[i]` is now `n + 1 - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.
