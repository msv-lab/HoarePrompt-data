Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`.** 

The code snippet assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1` to the variable `el`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, and `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range. The state of `s1` is not affected, and `el` now holds the element from `s1` at the index `i`.
