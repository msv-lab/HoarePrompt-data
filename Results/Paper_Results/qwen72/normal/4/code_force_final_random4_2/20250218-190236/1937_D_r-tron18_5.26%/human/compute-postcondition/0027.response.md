Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the last character of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zeroInd` is `n` + 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, `n`], `suffZero[-1]` is `n` and `suffZero[-2]` is 0. Therefore, `zeroInd` is `n` + 0, which simplifies to `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
