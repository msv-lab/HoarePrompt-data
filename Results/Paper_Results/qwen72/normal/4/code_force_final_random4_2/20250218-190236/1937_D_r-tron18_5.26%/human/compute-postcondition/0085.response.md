To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `el` is the last character of `s1` that was processed.
   - `totalOne` is `0`.
   - `preOne` is an empty list.
   - `suffZero` is a list with `n + 1` elements.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated based on the loop logic.

2. **Context:**
   - The variable `ans` is a list of length `n` that has been updated based on some loop logic. This means that each element in `ans` has been set to a specific value.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `ans` is a list of length `n` and all elements have been updated, we need to understand what the loop logic might have done to set these values.
   - Without the exact loop logic, we can only infer that `ans` contains some values that were computed based on the conditions and variables mentioned.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the context, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[values of ans separated by spaces] (where ans is a list of length n with all elements updated based on the loop logic)**

This means that the exact values of `ans` are not provided, but the print statement will output the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
