The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, and for this to happen, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop body. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
