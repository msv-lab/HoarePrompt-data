Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`, `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` remains unchanged or undefined.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as input integers.
- The value of `k` remains `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
- The value of `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- The value of `p2` remains unchanged or undefined.
