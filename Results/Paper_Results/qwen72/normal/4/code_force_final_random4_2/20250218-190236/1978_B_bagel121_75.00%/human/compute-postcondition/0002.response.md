The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning these integers to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.**
