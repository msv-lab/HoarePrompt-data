Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each test case. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `n`. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is the integer value of `(n - k) * a`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. For each test case within the loop, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the loop simply prints `n * a` and does not modify `a`, `b`, or `n`. If `a` is less than `b`, the loop calculates `k` as the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, then calculates `ans` as the integer value of the average of `b` and `b - k + 1` multiplied by `k`, and `p2` as the integer value of `(n - k) * a`. The final output for each test case is the sum of `ans` and `p2`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are independent and are not affected by the values of previous test cases.
