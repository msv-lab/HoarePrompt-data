Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.)
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.

Code Snippet:
```
print(n * a)
```

Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the product of the integers `n` and `a`.
- Since `n` and `a` are input integers, their exact values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are the input integers)**
