Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as input integers.
- The value of `k` remains the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- The value of `ans` remains the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
- `p2` is assigned the value `(n - k) * a`.
