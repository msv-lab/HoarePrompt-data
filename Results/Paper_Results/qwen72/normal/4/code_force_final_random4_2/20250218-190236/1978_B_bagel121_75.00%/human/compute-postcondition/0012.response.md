Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the input integers provided.
- The conditions for `a` and `b` and the subsequent calculations involving `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are not executed in this code snippet, so they do not affect the output state.
- The initial state that `t` is greater than 0 is updated to `t - 1`, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
