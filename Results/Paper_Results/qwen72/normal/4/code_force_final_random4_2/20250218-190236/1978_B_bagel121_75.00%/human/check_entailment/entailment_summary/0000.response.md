### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a >= b`**
     - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would yield a lower or equal profit.
     - The function correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `a < b`**
     - If the usual price `a` is less than the modified price `b`, Bob should consider selling some buns at the modified price to maximize profit.
     - The function calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. This is done by setting `k` to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
     - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k}{2}\).
     - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is calculated as \((n - k) \cdot a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts, and the function prints this value.

3. **Arithmetic Sequence Calculation:**
   - The formula \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k}{2}\) correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1.
   - This is derived from the sum of an arithmetic sequence formula: \(\frac{(first\_term + last\_term) \cdot number\_of\_terms}{2}\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) and when `k` is 0 or `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct output for each test case, which is the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering both the usual price and the modified price promotion. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.
