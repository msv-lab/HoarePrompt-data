### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `a >= b`. If this condition is true, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable than using the promotion. In this case, the profit is simply `n * a`, which is correct.

3. **Promotion Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program determines the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price, which is `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`. This is correct because:
     - `b - a + 1` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price higher than `a`.
     - `min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the total number of buns `n`.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated as `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series:
     - The price of the first bun is `b`.
     - The price of the `k`-th bun is `b - k + 1`.
     - The sum of the prices of the first `k` buns is the average of the first and last prices multiplied by `k`: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.

5. **Total Profit:**
   - The total profit is the sum of the profit from the first `k` buns and the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `ans + p2`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the total profit for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 4 5`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: \((5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2 = (5 + 4) / 2 * 2 = 9\).
  - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: \((4 - 2) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8\).
  - Total profit: \(9 + 8 = 17\).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5 5 9`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: \((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5 = (9 + 5) / 2 * 5 = 14 * 5 / 2 = 35\).
  - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: \((5 - 5) * 5 = 0\).
  - Total profit: \(35 + 0 = 35\).

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `10 10 5`
  - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `5 5 11`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 7` (but `k` cannot exceed `n`, so `k = 5`).
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: \((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5 = (11 + 7) / 2 * 5 = 18 * 5 / 2 = 45\).
  - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: \((5 - 5) * 5 = 0\).
  - Total profit: \(45 + 0 = 45\).

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

- **Example 6:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
  - Since `a >= b`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

- **Example 7:**
  - Input: `1000 1 1000`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: \((1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1)) / 2 * 1000 = (1000 + 1) / 2 * 1000 = 1001 * 500 = 500500\).
  - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: \((1000 - 1000) * 1 = 0\).
  - Total profit: \(500500 + 0 = 500500\).
