Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must be non-empty, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' if `cnt` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), `cur` is `1 << cur_ss` if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, `ss` is the second character of `s`.**
