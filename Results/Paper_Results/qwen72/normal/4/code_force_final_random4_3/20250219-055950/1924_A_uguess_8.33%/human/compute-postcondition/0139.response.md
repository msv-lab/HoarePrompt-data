Postcondition: ***`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.***
