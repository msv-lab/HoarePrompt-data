Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit corresponding to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a' is not set in `cur`, then `cur` is updated to have this bit set.***
