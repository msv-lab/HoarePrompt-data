The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `s` must ensure that it is not empty. The variable `ss` will take the value of each character in `s` during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the first character of `s`**
