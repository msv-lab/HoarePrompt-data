Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 because `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' for each time `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented, and `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters). Additionally, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
