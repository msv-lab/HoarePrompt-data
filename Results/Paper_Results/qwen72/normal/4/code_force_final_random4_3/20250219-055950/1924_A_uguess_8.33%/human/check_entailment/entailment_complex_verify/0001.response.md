### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (length of `s`), and then the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0 and `cur` to 0. `cnt` is used to count the number of valid subsequences of length `n` found, and `cur` is used to track the current bitmask of characters seen.

3. **Bitmask Explanation:**
   - The bitmask `cur` is used to represent the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - `1 << cur_ss` shifts the bit `1` to the position corresponding to the character `ss` (where `cur_ss` is the index of the character in the alphabet).
   - `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` checks if the character `ss` has not been seen yet in the current subsequence.
   - If the character is new, it adds the corresponding bit to `cur`.
   - `cur == (1 << k) - 1` checks if all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence.

4. **Counting Valid Subsequences:**
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means a valid subsequence of length `n` has been found, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - `cur` is reset to 0 to start checking for the next subsequence.

5. **Output:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
     - `tmp` is initialized to an empty string.
     - `ans` is constructed by repeating the last character (if any) that was not part of the current subsequence.
     - The program then adds the first character that was not seen in the current subsequence.
     - Finally, it adds 'a' to fill the remaining length of the string to `n`.

6. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Subsequence Counting:** The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence, but it does not correctly count the number of valid subsequences of length `n`. It increments `cnt` whenever it finds a subsequence that contains all `k` characters, but this does not necessarily mean that the subsequence is of length `n`.
   - **Flawed String Construction:** The logic for constructing the string that does not occur as a subsequence is incorrect. The program constructs a string by repeating the last character that was not part of the current subsequence, which is not a valid approach to ensure that the constructed string does not appear as a subsequence.
   - **Missing Subsequence Validation:** The program does not validate if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if the string contains all `k` characters in some order, which is not sufficient.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. The logic for counting valid subsequences and constructing a string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. A correct approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking if they are subsequences of `s`, or using a more efficient method to ensure the correctness of the output. The current implementation fails to meet the problem requirements and produces incorrect results.

Final: **False**
