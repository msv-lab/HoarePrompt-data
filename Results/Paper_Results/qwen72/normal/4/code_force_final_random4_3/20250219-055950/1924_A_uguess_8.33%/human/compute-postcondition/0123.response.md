Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged unless `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.**

Explanation:
- `cur_ss` is updated to the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. This is calculated using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
- The values of `s` and `ss` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `cnt` and `cur` are not affected by the code snippet provided, so they remain in their initial state.
