The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **NO**
