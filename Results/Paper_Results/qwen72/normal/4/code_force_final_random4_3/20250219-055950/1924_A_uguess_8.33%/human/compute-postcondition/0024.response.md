Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur` is `1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `cur` is `1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`.
