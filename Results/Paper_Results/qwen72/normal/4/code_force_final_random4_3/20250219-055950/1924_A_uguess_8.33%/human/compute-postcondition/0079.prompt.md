Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' if `cnt` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` remains the same.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must be non-empty, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' if `cnt` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), and `cur` is 0 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, `cur` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must be non-empty, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), `ss` is the second character of `s`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' if `cnt` was 1 and less than `n`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `ss` is the third character of `s`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is set to 0 and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
