Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `t` and `i`. The code snippet assigns `n`, `k`, and `m` the values from the input, where each value is converted to an integer. Therefore, `n`, `k`, and `m` now hold the input integers provided.
