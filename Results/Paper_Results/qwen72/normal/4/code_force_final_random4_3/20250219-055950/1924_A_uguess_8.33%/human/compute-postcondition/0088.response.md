The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. The value of `tmp` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a new input string
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`
- `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`
- `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters)
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string
- The current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`)

After executing the code snippet:
- `tmp` is assigned the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus `i`. Since `i` is 0, `tmp` is assigned the character `'a'`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters), `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is `'a'`, and the current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`).**
