Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `tmp` is 'b'.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + i)`.
- Since `i` is 1, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `ord('a') + 1`, which is 98.
- `chr(98)` is 'b'.
- The values of `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
