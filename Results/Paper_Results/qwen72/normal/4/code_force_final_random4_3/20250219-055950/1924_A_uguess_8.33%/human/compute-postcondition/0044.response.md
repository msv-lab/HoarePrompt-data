Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `tmp` is 'c'.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to `tmp`.
- Given that `i` is 2, `ord('a')` is 97, and `chr(97 + 2)` is 'c'.
- Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'c'.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
