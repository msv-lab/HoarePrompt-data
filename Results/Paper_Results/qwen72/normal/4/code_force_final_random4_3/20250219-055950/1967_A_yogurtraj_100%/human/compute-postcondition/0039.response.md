Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is \(n - 2\).
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`.
   - `k` is not 0.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `r` is calculated as \(r = a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor\), where `a[-1]` is the last element of the list `a` and \(\left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor\) is the integer division of `k` by `n`.
   - `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is \((r - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n\).

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - First, compute \(r\):
     \[
     r = a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Next, compute \((r - 1) * n\):
     \[
     (r - 1) * n = (a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor - 1) * n
     \]
   - Then, add 1 to the result:
     \[
     (a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor - 1) * n + 1
     \]
   - Finally, add the remainder \(k \% n\):
     \[
     (a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n
     \]

5. **Simplification:**
   - The expression can be simplified as:
     \[
     (a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
   - This can be further broken down:
     \[
     a[-1] * n + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor * n - n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     a[-1] * n + k - n + 1
     \]
   - Which simplifies to:
     \[
     a[-1] * n + k - n + 1
     \]

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of the expression \((a[-1] + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n\).

Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be:
Output: **(a[-1] * n + k - n + 1) (where a[-1] is the last element of the list `a`, `k` is the value of `k`, and `n` is the value of `n`)**
