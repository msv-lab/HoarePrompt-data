Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]`. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `k` is set to 0, `y` is set to `n - 1`, and `r` is set to `a[0] + k // 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to the second integer input by the user minus the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` multiplied by 1, and `r` is set to `a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `y` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `0 % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 2, `r` is `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition, and `k` is updated to 0 or `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])` depending on the condition. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `y` is `n - 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, and `r` is `a[2] + (k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` remains 0, `rem` remains 0, and `r` is `a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
