The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2` and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`. However, for the loop condition to still be true, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, which simplifies to `n` must be greater than 2 (this condition is already met and does not change).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2.**
