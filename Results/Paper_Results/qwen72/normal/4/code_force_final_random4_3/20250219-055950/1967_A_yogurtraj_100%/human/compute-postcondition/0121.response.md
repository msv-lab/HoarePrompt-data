Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 2, `r` is `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition, and `k` is updated to 0 or `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])` depending on the condition. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `y` is `n - 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, and `r` is `a[2] + (k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` remains 0, `rem` remains 0, and `r` is `a[3]`.***
