The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 (so `n - 1` is greater than 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and `r` is the second element of the list `a`. If ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k), then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
