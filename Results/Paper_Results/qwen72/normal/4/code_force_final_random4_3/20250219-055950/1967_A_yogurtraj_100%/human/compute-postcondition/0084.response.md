To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `ii` is 1.
   - `i` is \(n - 2\), where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is the value of `a[i + 1]` at the last iteration where the loop did not break.
   - `y` is the number of elements in the list `a` that were not processed in the loop.
   - `rem` is the remainder of `k` when the loop broke or 0 if the loop completed without breaking.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `r` is the value of `a[i + 1]` at the last iteration where the loop did not break. This means `r` is the element at index `n - 1` of the list `a` (since `i` is `n - 2` and `i + 1` is `n - 1`).
   - `y` is the number of elements in the list `a` that were not processed in the loop. Since `i` is `n - 2`, the elements at indices `n - 1` and `n` (if `n` is greater than 2) are not processed.
   - `rem` is the remainder of `k` when the loop broke or 0 if the loop completed without breaking. Since `k` is initialized to 0 and not modified in the given context, `rem` will be 0.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The expression to be printed is \((r - 1) \times n + 1 + rem + y\).
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a` (since `r` is `a[n - 1]`).
   - `y` is 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 3 (since the last two elements are not processed).
   - `rem` is 0.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to \((r - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + y\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - If `n` is 1, the list `a` has only one element, so `i` is -1, and `r` is undefined. This case is not possible given the initial state.
   - If `n` is 2, the list `a` has two elements, so `i` is 0, and `r` is the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`). `y` is 1 (since only the last element is not processed).
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 2`, and `r` is the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`). `y` is 2 (since the last two elements are not processed).

Given these conditions, the output will be:
- For `n = 2`: \((a[1] - 1) \times 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = (a[1] - 1) \times 2 + 2\).
- For `n >= 3`: \((a[n - 1] - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 2 = (a[n - 1] - 1) \times n + 3\).

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the last element of `a` and the length of `a`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 3 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list `a` and n is the length of the list `a`)**
