Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `rem = 0` reassigns the value of `rem` to 0, but since `rem` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs. All other variables remain unchanged.
