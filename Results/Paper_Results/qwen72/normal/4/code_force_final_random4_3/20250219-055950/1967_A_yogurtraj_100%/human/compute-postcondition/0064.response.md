Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is updated based on the condition, `y` is 1, `r` is `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)`, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`.
- Given that `i` is `n - 2`, substituting `i` in the expression gives `y = n - 1 - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `y = 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
