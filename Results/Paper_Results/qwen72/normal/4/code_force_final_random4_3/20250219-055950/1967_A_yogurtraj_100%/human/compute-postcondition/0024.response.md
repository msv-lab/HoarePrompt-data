Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the second element of the list `a`, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value.
- The value of `i` is 1, so `(i + 1)` is 2.
- The value of `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list `a`, and `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a`.
- Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[1] - a[0])`.
- The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `i`, `rem`, and `r` remain unchanged.
