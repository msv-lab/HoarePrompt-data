Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `rem` is `k % 3` (which is 0), `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3` (which is `a[2]`), `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
