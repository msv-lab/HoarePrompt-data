Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and `2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t - 1`, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are the last input integers for the final test case. **
