Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `j` is reset to 0, but since it was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `j` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `_`, and `l`) retain their initial values and states.
