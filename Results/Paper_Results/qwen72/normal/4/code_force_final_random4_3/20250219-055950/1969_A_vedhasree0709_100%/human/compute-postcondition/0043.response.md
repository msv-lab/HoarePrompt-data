Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `p` is the integer value of `l[0]`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `q` is the integer value of `l[p - 1]`.
   - The current value of `q` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer value `2`. This value is not dependent on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about other variables and objects, but the `print` statement does not use any of them.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
