Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` (or `n` if the loop completes without breaking), `_` is incremented by `n` (or the number of iterations before breaking), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to `q == i + 1` at any iteration.**
