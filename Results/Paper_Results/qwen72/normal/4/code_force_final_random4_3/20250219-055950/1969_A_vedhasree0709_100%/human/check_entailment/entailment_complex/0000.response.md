### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Monocarp needs to send invitations to his friends such that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of invitations sent.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and a list `l` of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list `l` to find a pair of indices `i` and `p[i] - 1` such that `l[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1**: If there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`), then sending invitations to these two friends will ensure that both come to the party. This is the minimum number of invitations needed, which is `2`.
   - **Case 2**: If no such pair exists, the function prints `3`. However, this is not always correct. Consider a scenario where the best friends form a cycle of length greater than 2. For example, if `p = [2, 3, 1]`, then sending invitations to any two friends will not ensure that both come to the party. In this case, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3` without considering other possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations might be sufficient.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it does not account for cases where the best friends form cycles of length greater than 2, which might still allow for fewer than 3 invitations to be sent to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
