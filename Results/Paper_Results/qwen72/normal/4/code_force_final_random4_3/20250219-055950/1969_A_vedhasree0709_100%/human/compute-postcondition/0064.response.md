Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value of `i` at which `q` equals `i + 1` if the loop breaks early, `j` is 1 if the loop breaks due to `q` being equal to `i + 1` at any point, otherwise `j` remains 0.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 5000. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as the input integer greater than 0. The value of `i` will be `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or it will be the value at which the condition `q == i + 1` was met and the loop broke early. The value of `j` will be 1 if the loop broke early due to `q` being equal to `i + 1` at any point during the iterations, otherwise, it will remain 0.
