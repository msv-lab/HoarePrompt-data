Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is now equal to the value at index 2 of `l`, `q` is now equal to the integer at the index `p - 1` in the list `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
