The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than the length of the list `ar`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have two scenarios:
1. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 2, `num` remains the first element of `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`.
2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the third element of `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `i` is either 2 or 3 at the end of the last iteration, `ar` must have at least 3 or 4 elements, respectively, to ensure the loop can execute again.

Since `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is either 2 or 3, we need to ensure that `ar` has at least 3 elements if `i` is 2, and at least 4 elements if `i` is 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 or 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`**
