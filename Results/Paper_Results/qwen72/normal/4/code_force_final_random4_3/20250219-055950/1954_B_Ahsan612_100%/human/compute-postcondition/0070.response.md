Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 4 or 5, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is 1.**

The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1. Since `same` was already set to 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
