Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of `ar`.**
