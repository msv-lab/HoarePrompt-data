### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it is no longer "beautiful". If it's impossible, output `-1`.
   - A "beautiful" array can be transformed by replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If it finds a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the final `same` count.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** If all elements are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array and prints `-1`.
   - **Single element array:** If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing it would make the array empty, which is not beautiful. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is `inf` and prints `-1`.
   - **Mixed elements:** The program correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Incorrect Update of `num` and `i` in the Loop:**
     - In the `else` block, the program increments `i` twice: once before updating `num` and once at the end of the loop. This can cause the program to skip elements and potentially miss the correct count of consecutive elements.
     - The correct approach should be to increment `i` only once in the `else` block to avoid skipping elements.

6. **Corrected Code:**
   - The corrected code should increment `i` only once in the `else` block to ensure that all elements are processed correctly.

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program has a logical error in the way it updates the index `i` and the variable `num`. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases. The corrected code addresses this issue and should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
