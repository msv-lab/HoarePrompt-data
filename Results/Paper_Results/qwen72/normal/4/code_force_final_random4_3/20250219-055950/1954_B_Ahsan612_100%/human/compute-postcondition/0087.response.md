The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers input by the user. For the loop to execute, `ar` must have at least 2 elements (since `i` starts at 1 and needs to be less than the length of `ar`).

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`**
