Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove in order to stop the array from being beautiful is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Array Characteristics**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`minn`). However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to stop the array from being beautiful.
   - The problem requires identifying elements that can be removed to prevent the array from being transformed into a non-beautiful state, not just the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (which is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements), but it does not handle other edge cases properly.

3. **Incorrect Update of `minn`**:
   - The program updates `minn` with the length of consecutive identical elements, but it does not consider the correct conditions for making the array non-beautiful.

4. **Incorrect Output for Some Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `1 2 1 2 1`, the program should output `1` (by removing the last `1`), but the logic in the program might not correctly identify this.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same. This involves checking for patterns where elements can be removed to break the beautiful property.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_removals_to_stop_beautiful():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = [0] * (n + 1)
        for num in ar:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        # If all elements are the same, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if max(freq) == n:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check for the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_removals = inf
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, freq[ar[i]])
        
        if min_removals == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

min_removals_to_stop_beautiful()
```

This corrected version:
- Handles the case where the array has only one element.
- Counts the frequency of each element to identify if all elements are the same.
- Checks for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property by looking for elements that can be removed to prevent the array from being transformed into a non-beautiful state.
