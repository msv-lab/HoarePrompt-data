The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user (relevant to the loop condition)
- `same` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 1 (relevant to the loop condition)

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is 1, `ar` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1**
