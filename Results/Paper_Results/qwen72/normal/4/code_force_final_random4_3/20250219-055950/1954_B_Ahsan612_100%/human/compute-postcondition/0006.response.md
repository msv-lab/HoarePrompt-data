Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition that `i` is now 1.
