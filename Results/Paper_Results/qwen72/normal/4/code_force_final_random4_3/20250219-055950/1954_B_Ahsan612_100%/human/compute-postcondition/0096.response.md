Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1. Additionally, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**
