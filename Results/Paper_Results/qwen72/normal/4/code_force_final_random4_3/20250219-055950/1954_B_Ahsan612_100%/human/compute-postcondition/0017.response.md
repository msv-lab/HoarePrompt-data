The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than the length of the list `ar`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 or 3, and `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `i` is 2 or 3, and `ar` must have at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `ar` must have at least 4 elements (if `i` is 3) or 3 elements (if `i` is 2).

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `i` is 2 or 3, `minn` is 1 (if `same` is 1)**
