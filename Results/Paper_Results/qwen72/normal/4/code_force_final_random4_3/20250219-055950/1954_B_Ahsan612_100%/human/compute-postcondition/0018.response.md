Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 2 or 3, `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `i` is 2 or 3, `minn` is 1 (if `same` was 1 before the code execution).**

Explanation:
- The value of `same` is incremented by 1, so if `same` was 1, it becomes 2; if `same` was 2, it becomes 3.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
