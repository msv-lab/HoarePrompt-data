### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it is no longer "beautiful". A "beautiful" array can be transformed to have all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If it finds a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the final `same` count.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly.
   - The state variables are updated as expected, and the logic for counting consecutive identical elements is sound.
   - The final check for `minn` being `inf` or equal to the length of the array ensures that the program handles cases where the array is entirely composed of the same element or where no such consecutive identical elements are found.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** The program correctly identifies this case and prints `-1` because removing any number of elements will not change the fact that the remaining elements are all the same.
   - **Single element array:** The program correctly identifies this case and prints `-1` because a single element array is trivially beautiful and removing it would make the array empty, which is not beautiful.
   - **Mixed elements:** The program correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if the array is already non-beautiful, but this is not necessary because the problem guarantees that the input array is always beautiful.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and handling the edge cases is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases, and the logic is sound.

Final: **True**
