Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`, `i` is 3 or 4, `minn` is 1 (if `same` is 1)**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is updated to `ar[i]`.
- Since `i` can be either 3 or 4, `num` is now either `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `i`, `minn`) remain unchanged.
