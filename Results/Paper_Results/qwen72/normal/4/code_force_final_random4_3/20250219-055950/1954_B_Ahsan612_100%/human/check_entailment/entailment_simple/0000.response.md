### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can repeatedly replace an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}` to eventually make all elements the same.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the number of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar`.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found.

3. **Loop to Find Minimum Consecutive Identical Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the array `ar` using a while loop.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` to skip the current element.
     - Updates `num` to the new element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1.
   - The loop continues until all elements are processed.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array `ar`, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array not beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Consecutive Identical Elements:**
  - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements and updates `minn` to the minimum length of these segments.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the array consists entirely of the same element, the program correctly outputs `-1` because removing any number of elements will still leave an array of identical elements, which remains beautiful.
  - If the array has segments of different lengths of consecutive identical elements, the program correctly finds the minimum length of these segments and outputs it.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic:
- **Incrementing `i` Twice:**
  - The program increments `i` twice when it encounters a different element: once inside the `else` block and once at the end of the while loop. This can cause the program to skip elements and potentially miss some segments of consecutive identical elements.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we should only increment `i` once per iteration:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: **False** (initially)**
- **Correctness: **True** (after fixing the increment issue)**

The initial program is incorrect due to the double increment of `i`, but the corrected program is correct.
