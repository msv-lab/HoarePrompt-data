The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` through some external means or context. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Given these constraints, the function `func` processes the input and returns some output based on the properties of the input parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement, so we can only describe the parameters and the context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the properties of the input parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the problem statement.**
