### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it is no longer "beautiful". A "beautiful" array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If it finds a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the final `same` count.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** If all elements are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array and prints `-1`.
   - **Single element array:** If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing it would make the array empty, which is not beautiful. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is `inf` and prints `-1`.
   - **Mixed elements:** The program correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful. However, the problem statement guarantees that the array is always beautiful, so this is not a concern.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and handling the edge cases is correct.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the first element.
  - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
  - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to track the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

- **Iteration:**
  - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
  - If the current element is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
  - If the current element is different, `i` is incremented, `num` is updated to the current element, and `minn` is updated with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
  - `same` is reset to 1 for the new element.

- **Final Update:**
  - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the final `same` count.

- **Output:**
  - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Verification Using Function Summary:

- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
- It handles the edge cases where the array is entirely composed of the same element or has only one element.
- The logic for updating `minn` and the final output is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the logic is sound. It correctly determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or outputs `-1` if it's impossible.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
