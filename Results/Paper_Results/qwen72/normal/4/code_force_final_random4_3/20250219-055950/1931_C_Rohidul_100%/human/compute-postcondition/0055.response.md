Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is 4, `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.**

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
