t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
