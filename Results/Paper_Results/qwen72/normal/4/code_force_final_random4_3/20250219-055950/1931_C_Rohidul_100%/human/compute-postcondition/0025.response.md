Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the remaining elements from `a[r]` to `a[st]` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is `n - st`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` is greater than `st - 1`, meaning the list `a` has more elements than the initial `st` consecutive equal elements.
- The list `a` still has the first `st` elements as consecutive equal elements.
- The remaining elements from `a[r]` to `a[st]` are also all equal, indicating that the loop has moved the index `r` to the point where the consecutive equal elements end.
- The variable `le` remains the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `l` remains `st - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the initial sequence of consecutive equal elements.
- The variable `r` is now `st - 1`, meaning the loop has decremented `r` until it reached the index just before the first element of the initial sequence of consecutive equal elements.
- The variable `end` is `n - st`, which counts the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list up to the point where they differ from the initial sequence.
