Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The variables `l` and `r` have been assigned the values 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `le`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
