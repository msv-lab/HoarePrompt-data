Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is `n - st`, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**
