To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is 1
- `end` is 1
- `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `r` is `n - 1`, and `l` is 0, `0 < n - 1` implies `n > 1`).

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - `l` is 0.
   - `a[l]` is `a[0]`.
   - `a[l + 1]` is `a[1]`.
   - For `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.

### Adjustments:
- **`n` must be greater than 1** to ensure `l < r` is true.
- **`a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`** to ensure `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is true.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
