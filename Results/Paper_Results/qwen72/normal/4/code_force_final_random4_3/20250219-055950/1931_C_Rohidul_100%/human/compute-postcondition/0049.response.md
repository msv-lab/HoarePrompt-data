Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`. Additionally, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.**
