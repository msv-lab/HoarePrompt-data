Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1**

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
