Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
- The first `st` elements of `a` are all equal.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is `st - 1`.
- `r` is `st - 1`.
- `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal.
- `end` is `n - st`.
- `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
- The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` and Consecutive Elements:**
   - `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal.
   - The first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `le` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal.
   - `end` is calculated as `n - st`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - Since `a[0] == a[-1]`, the condition `a[0] == a[-1]` is true.
   - Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

4. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans = max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - Substituting `end` with `n - st`, we get:
     \[
     ans = max(0, le - (st + (n - st))) = max(0, le - n)
     \]

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `ans` will be `max(0, le - n)`.
   - If `le` (the length of the list `a`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` will be `le - n`.
   - If `le` is less than `n`, then `ans` will be 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is `max(0, le - n)`.

Output: **max(0, le - n) (where le is the length of the list `a` and n is the input integer greater than 1)**
