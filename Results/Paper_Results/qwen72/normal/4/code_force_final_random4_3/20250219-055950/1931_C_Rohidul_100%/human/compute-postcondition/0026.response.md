Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the remaining elements from `a[r]` to `a[st]` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is `n - st`, `ans` is `le - max(st, n - st)`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is assigned the value of `le - max(st, end)`.
- `end` is `n - st`.
- `max(st, end)` will be the larger of `st` and `n - st`.
- `ans` will be `le` minus the larger of `st` and `n - st`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
