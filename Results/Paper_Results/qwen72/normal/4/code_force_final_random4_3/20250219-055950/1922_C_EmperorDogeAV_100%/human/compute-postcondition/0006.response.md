Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros; `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1; if `i` > 0, `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is 999999999999999999. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` remains 999999999999999999.***
