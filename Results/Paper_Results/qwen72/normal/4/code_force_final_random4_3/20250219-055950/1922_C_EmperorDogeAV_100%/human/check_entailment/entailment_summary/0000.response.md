### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It converts the city coordinates from strings to integers and stores them in a list `cities`.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, all set to 0.
   - For each city `i` (from 0 to `n-2`), it calculates the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`).
   - If the next city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, indicating that the cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin.
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, which is the cost of traveling to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum of `forward_cities`, and `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum of `backward_cities` (after reversing the `cities` list).
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost of traveling from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the source city `a` and the destination city `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the unique closest city requirement.
   - The prefix sum approach ensures that the cost calculation is efficient, even for large inputs.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities using the closest city strategy.
- The logic in `func_1` is correct, and the prefix sum calculations are appropriate for the problem.
- The program handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
