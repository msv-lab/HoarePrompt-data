To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first value in the range.

Given the initial state:
- `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
- `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros; `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
