The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities`, a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, and `n`, an integer representing the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each element at index `i` in `prog_cities` is either 1 if the city at index `i+1` in `cities` is closer to the city at index `i` than the city at index `i-1`, or the absolute difference between the city at index `i+1` and the city at index `i` otherwise. The original `cities` list remains unchanged.
