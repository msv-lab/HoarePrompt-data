Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros; `i` is greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1; `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]`; `forward` is 999999999999999999.** 

In natural language: The list `cities` remains unchanged, and it still contains n integers in strictly ascending order. The list `prog_cities` is still a list of n-1 zeros. The variable `i` is still greater than 0, and `n` is still greater than 1. The variable `back` is now equal to the value of the element at index `i - 1` in the `cities` list. The variable `forward` remains 999999999999999999.
