t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5) and a list a of n integers (0 <= a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace, there exists at least one suitable string s.
