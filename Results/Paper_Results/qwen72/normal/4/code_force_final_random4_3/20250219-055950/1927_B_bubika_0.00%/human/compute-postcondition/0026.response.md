Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the first integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r += a[x]` appends the character at index `x` in the string `a` to the string `r`.
- `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- `b` remains a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`.
- `t` remains 1.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- `s` remains a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer.
- `r` is now a string containing the character at index `x` in `a`.
- `i` remains the first integer in `s`.
- `x` remains the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.
