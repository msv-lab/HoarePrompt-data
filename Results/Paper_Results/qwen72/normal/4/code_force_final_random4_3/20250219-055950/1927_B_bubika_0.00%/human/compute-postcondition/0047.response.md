Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 1, `t` is 2, `n` is the new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `r` is the string containing the character at index `x` in `a`, `i` is the second integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = b.index(i)` updates the value of `x` to the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is the second integer in `s`, and `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `x` and retains the initial state of all other variables.
