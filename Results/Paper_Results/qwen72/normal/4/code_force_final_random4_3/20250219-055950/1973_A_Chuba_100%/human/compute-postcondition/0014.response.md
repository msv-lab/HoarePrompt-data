Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is 1, `v` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, there is no change to the variables. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is even, `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.***
