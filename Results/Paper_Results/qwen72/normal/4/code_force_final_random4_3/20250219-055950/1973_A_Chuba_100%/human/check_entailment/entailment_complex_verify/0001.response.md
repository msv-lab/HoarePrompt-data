### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Checking for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total score is impossible.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \right) // 2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the following logic:
     - The total number of points is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is because if `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means that `v[2]` must have won all the games against the other two players, which is not possible if there are draws.
     - The formula then subtracts the excess points that cannot be explained by draws and divides by 2 to get the number of draws.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.
   - This output format is correct and matches the problem description.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the input and output handling.
- The logic for checking the validity of the scores is accurate.
- The formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is derived correctly and handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

### Additional Test Cases:
To further validate the program, let's consider a few more test cases:

- **Test Case: (0, 0, 0)**
  - Sum: 0 (even)
  - Result: (0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0
  - Expected Output: 0
  - Program Output: 0
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case: (0, 1, 1)**
  - Sum: 2 (even)
  - Result: (0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Program Output: 1
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case: (1, 1, 1)**
  - Sum: 3 (odd)
  - Result: -1
  - Expected Output: -1
  - Program Output: -1
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case: (1, 1, 2)**
  - Sum: 4 (even)
  - Result: (1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2
  - Expected Output: 2
  - Program Output: 2
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case: (3, 3, 3)**
  - Sum: 9 (odd)
  - Result: -1
  - Expected Output: -1
  - Program Output: -1
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case: (3, 4, 5)**
  - Sum: 12 (even)
  - Result: (3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6
  - Expected Output: 6
  - Program Output: 6
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case: (1, 1, 10)**
  - Sum: 12 (even)
  - Result: (1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2
  - Expected Output: 2
  - Program Output: 2
  - **Correct**

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic for both checking the validity of the scores and calculating the maximum number of draws is sound. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
