You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is `t-1`, `v` is a list of integers provided by the user. For each iteration, if the sum of the first three elements of `v` (i.e., `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is odd, `-1` is printed. If the sum is even, `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and this value is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`) from the user. If the sum of these three integers is odd, the function prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Checking for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \right) // 2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the following logic:
     - The total number of points is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
     - The maximum number of points that can be distributed without any draws is `2 * (number of games)`.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is because if `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means that `v[2]` must have won all the games against the other two players, which is not possible if there are draws.
     - The formula then subtracts the excess points that cannot be explained by draws and divides by 2 to get the number of draws.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The logic for checking the validity of the scores is correct.
- The formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is derived correctly and handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
