Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is `t-1`, `v` is a list of integers provided by the user. For each iteration, if the sum of the first three elements of `v` (i.e., `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is odd, `-1` is printed. If the sum is even, `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and this value is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop counter `_` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. For each of these `t` iterations, the user is prompted to input three integers, and the loop checks if their sum is odd or even. If the sum is odd, the loop prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and prints this result. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `v` is updated with each new user input for each iteration.
