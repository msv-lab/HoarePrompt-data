### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Checking for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \right) // 2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the following logic:
     - The total number of points is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
     - The maximum number of points that can be distributed without any draws is `2 * (number of games)`.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is because if `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means that `v[2]` must have won all the games against the other two players, which is not possible if there are draws.
     - The formula then subtracts the excess points that cannot be explained by draws and divides by 2 to get the number of draws.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The logic for checking the validity of the scores is correct.
- The formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is derived correctly and handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
