### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw). This check is correct.

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` is not more than the sum of the other two scores plus the number of draws. This is because if `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest scorer must have won more games than the other two players combined, which is not possible without an excessive number of draws.
     - The formula then subtracts this value from the total score and divides by 2 to get the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All scores are zero**: The program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **One draw**: The program correctly handles cases where only one draw occurred.
   - **No valid set of games**: The program correctly prints `-1` when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
   - **Maximum draws**: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid scores.

### Verification with Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Sum: `0` (even)
  - Formula: `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Sum: `2` (even)
  - Formula: `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Sum: `3` (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Sum: `4` (even)
  - Formula: `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Sum: `9` (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Sum: `12` (even)
  - Formula: `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`
  - Output: `6` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Sum: `12` (even)
  - Formula: `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases provided in the problem description. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is derived from the constraints and the scoring system, and it appears to be logically sound. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.
