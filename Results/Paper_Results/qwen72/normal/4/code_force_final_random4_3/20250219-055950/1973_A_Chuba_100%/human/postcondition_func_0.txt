The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`) from the user. If the sum of these three integers is odd, the function prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
