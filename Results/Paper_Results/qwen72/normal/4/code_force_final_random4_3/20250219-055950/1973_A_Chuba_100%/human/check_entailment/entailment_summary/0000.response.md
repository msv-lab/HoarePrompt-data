Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the three scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1`. This is correct because in a game where each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for the winner and 0 for the loser, or 1 for each in a draw), the total sum of points must always be even. Therefore, if the sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve the given scores, and `-1` is the correct output.

2. **Even Sum Calculation**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2`. Let's break down this formula:
   - `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` is the total number of points.
   - `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` is the maximum number of points that the highest scorer (p_3) could have earned without any draws. This is because the highest scorer could have won all their games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn all their games against each other.
   - Subtracting `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` from the total points gives the number of points that must have been earned through draws.
   - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, since each draw results in 2 points (1 for each player).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0, which is even. The formula results in `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2, which is even. The formula results in `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3, which is odd. The program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4, which is even. The formula results in `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`, which is correct.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9, which is odd. The program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12, which is even. The formula results in `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12, which is even. The formula results in `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`, which is correct.

The program handles all the test cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement.
