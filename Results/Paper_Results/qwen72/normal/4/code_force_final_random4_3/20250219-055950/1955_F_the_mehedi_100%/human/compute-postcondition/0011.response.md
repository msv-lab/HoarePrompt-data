Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `cnt` is `cnt` + `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`, where `x` is the third integer in the list `a`. The values of `_`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged. The updated value of `cnt` is `cnt` + `math.floor(x / 2)`.
