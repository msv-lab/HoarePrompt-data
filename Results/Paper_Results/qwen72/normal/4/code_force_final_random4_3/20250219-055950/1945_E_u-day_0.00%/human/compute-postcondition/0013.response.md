Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The value of `n` remains the same as its initial value.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`.
- If the integer `k` is found in the list `arr`, the variable `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, the variable `pos` remains -1.
