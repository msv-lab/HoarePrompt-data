Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n-1) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `mid`, `high` must satisfy `low + 1 < high`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
- The condition `low + 1 < high` must still be satisfied, but now `low` is equal to `mid`.
