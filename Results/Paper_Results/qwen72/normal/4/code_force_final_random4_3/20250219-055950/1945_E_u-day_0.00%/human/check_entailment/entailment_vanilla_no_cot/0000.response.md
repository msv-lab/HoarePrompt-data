Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the binary search will find the element `x` at the correct position. Instead, it only identifies the position `pos` where `x` is located and then performs a single swap if the binary search does not find `x` at the position `low`. This approach is insufficient because:

1. **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: The binary search algorithm is designed to work on sorted arrays. Since the input is a permutation (which is not necessarily sorted), the binary search may not find the correct element even after one swap.

2. **Number of Swaps**: The problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps to be performed before the binary search. The provided program only performs 1 swap, which is not always sufficient to ensure the binary search will find the element `x` at the correct position.

3. **Correctness of Output**: The program does not always produce the correct number of swaps or the correct indices for the swaps. For example, in the case where the array is already sorted, it should output 0 swaps, but it does not handle this scenario correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
- Perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.
- Ensure that the binary search will work correctly by making the necessary swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    
    # Find the correct position for k in a sorted array
    correct_pos = k - 1
    
    # If k is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed
    if pos == correct_pos:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Perform the first swap to move k to the correct position
    arr[pos], arr[correct_pos] = arr[correct_pos], arr[pos]
    swaps = [(pos + 1, correct_pos + 1)]
    
    # Check if the binary search will work correctly after the first swap
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(1)
        for swap in swaps:
            print(*swap)
        return
    
    # If the binary search still doesn't work, perform a second swap
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    
    # Find the correct position for k in a sorted array
    correct_pos = k - 1
    
    # Perform the second swap to move k to the correct position
    for i in range(n):
        if i != correct_pos and arr[i] > k and arr[correct_pos] < k:
            arr[i], arr[correct_pos] = arr[correct_pos], arr[i]
            swaps.append((i + 1, correct_pos + 1))
            break
    
    print(2)
    for swap in swaps:
        print(*swap)

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_3()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that up to 2 swaps are performed to make the binary search work correctly, and it outputs the correct number of swaps and their indices.
