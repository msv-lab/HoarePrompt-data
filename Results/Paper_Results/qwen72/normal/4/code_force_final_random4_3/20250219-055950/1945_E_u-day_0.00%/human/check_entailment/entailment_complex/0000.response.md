### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to get `n` and `k`.
   - `func_2` reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is used to get the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The function `func_3` iterates over the list `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `k`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The function initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1 >= high`.
   - During the loop, if `arr[mid] > k`, it updates `high` to `mid`; otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap is needed to place `k` at the correct position.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The binary search is performed correctly, but the program assumes that the permutation can be sorted by at most two swaps to ensure the binary search finds the correct position.
   - The function `func_3` only performs one swap if `k` is not found at `low` after the binary search. This is not sufficient to guarantee that the permutation can be sorted with at most two swaps.
   - The problem statement requires that the permutation can be rearranged with at most two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. However, the provided code only performs one swap and does not handle the case where two swaps are needed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the problem's requirement of ensuring the permutation can be rearranged with at most two swaps to make the binary search work correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
