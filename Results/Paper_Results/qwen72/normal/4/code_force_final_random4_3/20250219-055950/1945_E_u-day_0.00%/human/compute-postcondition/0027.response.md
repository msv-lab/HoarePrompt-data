Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n-1) // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `high` is updated to `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `low`, `pos`, `st`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state.
