The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` is now equal to `mid`, `low` is also `(low + high) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n-1) // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
