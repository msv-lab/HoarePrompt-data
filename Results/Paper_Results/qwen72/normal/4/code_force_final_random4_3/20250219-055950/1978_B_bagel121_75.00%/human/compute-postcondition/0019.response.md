The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the values of `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**
