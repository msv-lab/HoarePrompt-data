Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

The value of `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial values.
