Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is calculated using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is the integer result of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
