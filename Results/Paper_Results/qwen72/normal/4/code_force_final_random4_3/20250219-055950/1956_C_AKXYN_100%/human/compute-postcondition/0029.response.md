Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 4, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its initial value of 1. Since `i` is 1, the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`. However, there seems to be a mistake in the initial state provided in the task, as the initial value of `res` is stated as 1, and the correct calculation should result in `res` being 7, not 4. Assuming the initial state is correct, the correct output state should be `res` is 7. 

Given the format and the task, the correct output state should be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 7, `i` is 1**
