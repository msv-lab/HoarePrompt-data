Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `i`, which was initially set to `n-1`, is now 0. This is because the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1, and after the last iteration, `i` is decremented to 0, which is the point at which the loop condition `i > 0` becomes false and the loop terminates.
