The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, another integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 500. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and for each test case, another integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500), but the specific return value or output is not provided.**
