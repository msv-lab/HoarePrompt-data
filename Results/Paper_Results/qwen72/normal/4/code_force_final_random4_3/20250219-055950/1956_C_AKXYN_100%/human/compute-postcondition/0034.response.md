To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n, 0, -1)`, which means `i` will start at `n` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1
- `i` is n-1

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is `n`**
