### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the matrix `mat` with each row containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This initialization is correct because it ensures that each row starts with a valid permutation.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each element in the matrix will be a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of all elements in the matrix will be maximized by ensuring each element is as large as possible.
   - The formula simplifies to \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1) \).
   - This sum is correct because it accounts for the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements when each row and column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Operation Output**:
   - The program outputs the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then prints \( 2n \) operations, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations for each row and column.
   - The operations are valid because they use permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) and apply these permutations to both rows and columns.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The program ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values by using permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) in both rows and columns.
   - The number of operations \( 2n \) is within the allowed limit.
   - The sum calculation is correct and matches the problem's requirement to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
