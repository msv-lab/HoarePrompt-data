Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]` updates the `mat` variable.
- `mat` is now a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
