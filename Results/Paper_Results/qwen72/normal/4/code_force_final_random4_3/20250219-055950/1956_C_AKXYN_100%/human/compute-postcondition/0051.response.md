Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 4, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res`. Initially, `res` is 1 and `i` is 1. The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`. However, there was a mistake in the calculation, and the correct value of `res` after the execution is `1 + 6 = 7`. The correct output state should be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 7, `i` is 1**
