The value of `res` is updated by adding the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Therefore, `res` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 1, `i` is 0.**
