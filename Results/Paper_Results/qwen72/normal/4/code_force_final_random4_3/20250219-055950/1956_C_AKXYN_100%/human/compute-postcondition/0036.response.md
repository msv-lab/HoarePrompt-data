Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is set to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses the format `'2 %d' % i` to print the string "2" followed by the value of `i`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints each element in the range.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted to "2 n" where `n` is the value of `n`.
   - The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**

This means the print statement will output "2 n" followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
