The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `mat`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 0.**
