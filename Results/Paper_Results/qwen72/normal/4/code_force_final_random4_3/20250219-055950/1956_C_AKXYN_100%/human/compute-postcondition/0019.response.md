Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n-1\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses a format string `'1 %d' % i` to print the number 1 followed by the value of `i`.
   - `i` is defined as \(n-1\), so the value of `i` will be \(n-1\).
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will unpack the range from 1 to `n` inclusive, which means it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first part of the print statement will be `'1 %d' % i`, which will print `1` followed by the value of `i`.
   - The second part will print the range of integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n-1] is the value of `n-1` and [n] is the value of `n`)**

For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5**
