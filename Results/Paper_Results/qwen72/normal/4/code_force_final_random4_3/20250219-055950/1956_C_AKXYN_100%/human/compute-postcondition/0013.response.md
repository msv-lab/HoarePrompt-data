Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
   - `i` is n-1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses a format string `'1 %d' % i` where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is `n-1`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into individual elements.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `i` is `n-1`.
   - The range `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will first print the string `'1'` followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`).
   - Then, it will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**

For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be:
Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5**
