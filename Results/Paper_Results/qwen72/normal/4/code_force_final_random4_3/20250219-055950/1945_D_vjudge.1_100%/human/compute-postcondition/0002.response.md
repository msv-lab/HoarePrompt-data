The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements down to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` must start at `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
