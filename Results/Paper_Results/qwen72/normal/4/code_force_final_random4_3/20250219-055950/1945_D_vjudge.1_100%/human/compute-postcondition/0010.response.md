To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 0 and iterates up to `k-1`. The initial state provided sets `i` to `-1`, which is incorrect for the loop to start. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 0.
2. **Variable `k`**: The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. The initial state provided ensures that `1 <= k <= n`, which is sufficient for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these adjustments, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, `i` is 0, `ans` is set to positive infinity**
