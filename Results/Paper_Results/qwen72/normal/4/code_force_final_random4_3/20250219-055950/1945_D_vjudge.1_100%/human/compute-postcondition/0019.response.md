Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function computes the minimum value of the expression `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, k-1]`, where `suff` is a suffix sum array derived from the list `c`, which contains the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. The function then prints this minimum value. After the function concludes, the input parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the computed minimum value being printed. **
