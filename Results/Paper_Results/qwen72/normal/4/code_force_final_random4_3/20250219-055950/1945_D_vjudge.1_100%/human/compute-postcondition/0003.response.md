Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `suff[n - 1]` which is now `c[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `suff[i]` by adding `c[i]` to `suff[i + 1]`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[n - 1] = suff[n] + c[n - 1]`. Given that all elements of `suff` were initially 0, `suff[n]` is 0, so `suff[n - 1]` is now equal to `c[n - 1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `i` remains `n - 1`.
