Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue with the minimum cost. The cost to move from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`) is `a_j` plus the sum of `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **List `c` Construction**: The list `c` is constructed by taking the minimum of each corresponding element in `a` and `b`. This is done because Kirill can choose to pay either `a_i` or `b_i` when moving, and he will always choose the minimum cost.
   - **Suffix Sum Array `suff`**: The suffix sum array `suff` is constructed to store the cumulative sum of the elements in `c` from the current position to the end of the list. This helps in efficiently calculating the total cost of moving to any position.
   - **Finding Minimum Cost**: The program iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost of moving to each position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. It keeps track of the minimum cost encountered.

4. **Output**:
   - The minimum cost is printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly by only considering the cost of moving to the first position.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly by considering all possible positions.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The construction of the suffix sum array `suff` is done in O(n) time.
   - The iteration to find the minimum cost is done in O(k) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `k` people.
   - The logic of using the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` and the suffix sum array ensures that the cost is calculated efficiently and accurately.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
