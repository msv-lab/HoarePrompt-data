Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It counts the number of '1's in each line that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first and second elements of `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value. **
