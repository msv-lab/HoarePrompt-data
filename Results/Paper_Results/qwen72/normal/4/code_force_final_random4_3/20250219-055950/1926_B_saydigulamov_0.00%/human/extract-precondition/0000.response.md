Precondition: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by n lines each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.**
