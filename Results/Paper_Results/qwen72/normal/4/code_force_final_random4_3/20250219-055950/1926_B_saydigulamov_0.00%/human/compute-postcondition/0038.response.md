Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is a list containing the number of '1' characters in each input string `b` provided during the loop iterations. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings `b` that contained at least one '1' character. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this condition is retained.***
