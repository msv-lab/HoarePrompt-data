Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Output Mismatch**: The program is supposed to output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case, but it instead prints the list `k` if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This is not the correct output format.

2. **Shape Identification**: The program attempts to identify the shape by checking if the first and second elements of `k` (the counts of '1's in the first and second rows that contain '1's) are equal. However, this is insufficient to determine the shape correctly:
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's should increase or decrease by 2 in each consecutive row (i.e., the counts should form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2).

3. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases but does not properly handle the input for each test case. It should read the grid and then determine the shape for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the shape might be an upside-down triangle or a square with a different starting position.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
