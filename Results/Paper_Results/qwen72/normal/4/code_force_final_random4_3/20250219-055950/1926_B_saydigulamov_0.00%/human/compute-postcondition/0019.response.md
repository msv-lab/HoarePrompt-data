Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this condition is retained.***
