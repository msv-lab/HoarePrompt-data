Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list if the input string `b` does not contain the character '1'. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing the number of '1' characters in `b`. `b` is an input string, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is a list. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` contains the number of '1' characters in `b` plus one additional count of '1' characters in `b`. If `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains an empty list. `b` is the input string provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is a list that contains the number of '1' characters in `b` plus one additional count of '1' characters in `b` if `b` contains the character '1', or remains an empty list if `b` does not contain the character '1', `b` is the new input string provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
