Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is insufficient to identify the shape correctly. For example, consider the following grid:

```
3
010
111
010
```

This grid represents a triangle, but the program will incorrectly output "SQUARE" because the first two rows have the same number of '1's. The program needs to implement a more comprehensive check to correctly identify the shape based on the problem description.
