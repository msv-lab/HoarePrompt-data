Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' into a list `k`.
   - However, the program only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal to determine the shape. This is insufficient for the following reasons:
     - For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal.
     - For a triangle, the elements should form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one (for a right-side-up or upside-down triangle, respectively).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").
   - This is a clear logical error, as the output format does not match the problem description.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - The condition `if k[0] == k[1]` is too simplistic and does not correctly identify the shape.
   - The program does not check if the elements in `k` form a valid sequence for a triangle or if all elements are equal for a square.
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains an upside-down triangle correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains a rotated triangle (which is not allowed but should be considered invalid).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
     - Check if all elements in `k` are equal to determine if it's a square.
     - Check if the elements in `k` form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one to determine if it's a triangle.
   - Additionally, the program should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the result of these checks.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment accurately identifies the logical errors and the incorrect output format.

Final: **False**
