The provided Python code snippet is simply:
```
print('1')
```

This statement prints the string `'1'` to the console. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal `'1'`.

Output: **1**
