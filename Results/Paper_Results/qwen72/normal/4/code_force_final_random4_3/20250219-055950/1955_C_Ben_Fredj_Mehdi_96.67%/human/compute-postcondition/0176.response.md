Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2. If `a[d]` is 0, the value at index `d` in the list `a` is decremented by 1 and `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` is not 0, the value at index `d` in the list `a` is decremented by 1.***
