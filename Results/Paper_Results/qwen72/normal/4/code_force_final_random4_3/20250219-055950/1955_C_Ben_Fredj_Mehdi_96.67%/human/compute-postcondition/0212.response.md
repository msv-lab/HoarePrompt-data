The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'99'`.

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

However, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'99'`.

Output: **99**
