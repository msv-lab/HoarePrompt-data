The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code is solely determined by the string literal `'200'` that is passed to the `print` function.

Output: **200**
