The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `k // 2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `k // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k // 2` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
