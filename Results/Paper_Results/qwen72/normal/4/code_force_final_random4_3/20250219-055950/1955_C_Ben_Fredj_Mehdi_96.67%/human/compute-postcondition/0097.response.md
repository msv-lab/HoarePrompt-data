An exception in the given `try` block could occur at the points where `a[g]` and `a[d]` are accessed and modified. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`, or if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to integers, an exception will be raised.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after decrementing, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs at any point during these operations, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If no exception occurs, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1` and `a[g]` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after decrementing, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: If no exceptions occur, the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are decremented by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after decrementing, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs (e.g., due to out-of-bounds access or type conversion issues), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unchanged.
