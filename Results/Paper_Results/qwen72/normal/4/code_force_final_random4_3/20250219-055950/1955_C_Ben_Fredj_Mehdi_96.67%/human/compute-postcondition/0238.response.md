Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0, `a[0]` is the first integer in `a` minus 1. If `a[0]` is 0, `g` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `g` remains 0. The last element of `a` is 0.**
