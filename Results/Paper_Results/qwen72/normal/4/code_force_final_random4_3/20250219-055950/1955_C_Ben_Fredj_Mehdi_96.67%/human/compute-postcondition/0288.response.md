Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the corresponding output has been printed based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` for each iteration remain unchanged after the output is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user.
- For each iteration, the values of `a`, `n`, and `k` are read from the input.
- Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, specific conditions are checked, and the corresponding output is printed.
- If none of the conditions are met, the loop performs a series of operations on the list `a` and prints the count of zeros in the list.
- After each iteration, the values of `a`, `n`, and `k` are reset to the new input values for the next iteration.
- The loop variable `z` increments from 0 to `t-1` as the loop progresses.
- Once the loop has completed all `t` iterations, the final state is that the loop has executed `t` times, and the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` for each iteration remain as they were when the output was printed.
