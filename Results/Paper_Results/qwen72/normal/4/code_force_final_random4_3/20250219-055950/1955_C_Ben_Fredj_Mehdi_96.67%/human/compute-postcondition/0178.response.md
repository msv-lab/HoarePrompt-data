An exception could occur at the points where the program attempts to access or modify elements in the list `a` using the indices `g` and `d`. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the valid index range for the list `a`, an `IndexError` would be raised. Additionally, if `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to an integer, a `ValueError` might be raised.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the value at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs, the `except` block causes the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2. If no exception occurs, the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are decremented by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
