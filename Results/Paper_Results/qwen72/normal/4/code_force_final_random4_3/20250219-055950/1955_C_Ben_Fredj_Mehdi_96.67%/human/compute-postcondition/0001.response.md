The only object in the loop head is the variable `z` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `z` will start at 0, as it is the first iteration of the loop. The other variables `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
