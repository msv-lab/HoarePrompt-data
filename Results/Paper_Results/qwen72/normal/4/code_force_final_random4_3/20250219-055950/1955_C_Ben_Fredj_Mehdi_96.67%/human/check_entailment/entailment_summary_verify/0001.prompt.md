You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from a single input line, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from another input line. The function processes each test case and prints a result based on specific conditions involving `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`. If `k` matches certain predefined values, a specific result is printed. Otherwise, the function attempts to decrement elements from both ends of the list `a` until `k` is exhausted, and then prints the number of zeros in the list `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` representing the durability of the ships.

2. **Special Cases**: The program includes several special cases where it directly prints a pre-defined number of sunk ships based on specific values of `k` and `n`. These special cases are likely intended to handle edge cases or large inputs where the general algorithm might be inefficient or incorrect.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program initializes `d` to `len(a) - 1` (the index of the last ship) and `g` to `0` (the index of the first ship).
   - It then enters a loop that runs `k // 2` times, simulating the Kraken's attacks on the first and last ships in each iteration.
   - In each iteration, it reduces the durability of the ships at indices `g` and `d` by 1.
   - If the durability of the ship at index `g` becomes 0, it increments `g` to move to the next ship.
   - If the durability of the ship at index `d` becomes 0, it decrements `d` to move to the previous ship.
   - If `k` is odd, it performs one additional attack on the ship at index `g`.
   - Finally, it counts the number of ships with zero durability and prints this count.

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Special Cases**: The special cases are hardcoded and do not follow a logical pattern. They seem to be specific to certain test cases and might not cover all edge cases or large inputs. This approach is not scalable and can lead to incorrect results for inputs that are not explicitly listed.

2. **General Case**:
   - The loop runs `k // 2` times, which is correct for simulating the Kraken's alternating attacks.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `k` is very large and the number of ships is small. For example, if `k` is much larger than the sum of the durabilities of all ships, the program should print the total number of ships, but it might not do so correctly due to the hardcoded special cases.
   - The `try`-`except` block is used to handle cases where `g` or `d` might go out of bounds, but this is not a robust solution. A better approach would be to check the bounds explicitly before performing the attacks.

3. **Efficiency**: The program's efficiency can be improved. For example, if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the durabilities of all ships, the program should immediately print the total number of ships without running the loop.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct due to the hardcoded special cases and the potential issues with handling large inputs and boundary conditions. A more robust and efficient approach is needed to handle all cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
