Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` is at least 2. If `k` is odd, `i` is `k // 2 - 1` (or the loop could have broken due to an exception), `a[g]` is decremented by 1, `a[d]` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, and `d` remains unchanged.***
