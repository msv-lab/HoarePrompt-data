Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.** 

The initial state variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input string, and `n` and `k` are updated to be the first and second integers in this list, respectively.
