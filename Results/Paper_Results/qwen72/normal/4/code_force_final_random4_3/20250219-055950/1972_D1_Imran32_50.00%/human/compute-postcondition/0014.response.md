The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6. Additionally, the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 × 10^6.

However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters or return values. Assuming the function should return some result based on the input parameters `n` and `m` for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` for each of up to 10^4 test cases, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6 and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases not exceeding 2 × 10^6. It returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.**
