Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the function `func_1` in the provided code does not implement this logic at all. Instead, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `n` and `m`), and then calculates a value `ans` using a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1. This loop and the calculation of `ans` do not correspond to the problem's requirements.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Reading `n` and `m` for each test case.
2. Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
3. For each pair, checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.
5. Printing the count for each test case.

The provided code does not perform any of these steps. It seems to be calculating something unrelated to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
