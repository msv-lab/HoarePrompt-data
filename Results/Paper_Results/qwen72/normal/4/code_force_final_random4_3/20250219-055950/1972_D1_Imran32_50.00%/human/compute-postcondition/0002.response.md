Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 × 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values of two integers provided by the user. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. `root` is assigned the value of the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1.**
