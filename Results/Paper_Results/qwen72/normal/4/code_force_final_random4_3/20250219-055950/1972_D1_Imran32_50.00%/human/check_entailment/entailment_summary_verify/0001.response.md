### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem description).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in the range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1()` is not correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem.
   - The variable `k` is read but not used, which suggests a potential misunderstanding or error in the function.
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to be related to the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation \((n + i) // cnt\) does not correspond to any known method for solving the given problem.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done using a nested loop, but given the constraints, a more efficient approach is needed.
   - One efficient approach is to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the fact that \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified to checking if \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The logic inside the function `func_1()` is incorrect and does not match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` contains logical flaws and does not implement the required logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
