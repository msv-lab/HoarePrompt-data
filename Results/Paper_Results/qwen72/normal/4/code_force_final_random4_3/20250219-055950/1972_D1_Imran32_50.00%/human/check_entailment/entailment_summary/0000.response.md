Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program `func_1` does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a different value using a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `n`. This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

Additionally, the function `func_1` takes two inputs `n` and `k`, but the problem description specifies that the inputs should be `n` and `m`. The variable `k` is not used in the function, which suggests a mismatch between the intended problem and the implemented solution.

Given these discrepancies, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
