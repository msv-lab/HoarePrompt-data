### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\), but the variable name is incorrect).
   - The program initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the integer part of the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing this in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive), and for each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **State of the program before the function call**:
     - The function `func_1` is expected to take two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) as input.
     - The function should handle multiple test cases.
     - The sum of all \(n\) values and the sum of all \(m\) values across all test cases should not exceed \(2 \times 10^6\).

   - **State inside the function**:
     - The program reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
     - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
     - It calculates the integer part of the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing this in `root`.
     - It iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive), and for each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\).
     - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
     - It prints `ans`.

4. **Comparison with Problem Statement**:
   - The program does not consider the value of \(m\) at all.
   - The logic inside the loop does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) is not related to the problem of finding valid pairs \((a, b)\).

5. **Example Validation**:
   - For the input \((n=2, m=3)\), the correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - However, the program will calculate `ans` based on the loop and the formula \((n + i) // (i \times i)\), which is not related to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described and does not handle the required conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

Final: **False**
