Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearrangement. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements. This does not help in finding the maximum beauty of the array.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Calculate the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The current program does not perform the calculation part, and it prints the sorted array elements instead of the maximum beauty value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
