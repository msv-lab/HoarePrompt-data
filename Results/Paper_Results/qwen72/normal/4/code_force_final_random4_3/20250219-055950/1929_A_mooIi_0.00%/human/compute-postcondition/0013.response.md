The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the example. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 500), `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific conditions for the return value are not provided.**
