Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted array, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as required. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last. The program should compute this sum after potentially rearranging the array to maximize the beauty, but it does not perform this calculation. Instead, it simply prints the sorted array, which is not the correct output format and does not address the problem's requirements.
