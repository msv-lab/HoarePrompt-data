The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
