Reasoning:

The provided program is not correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the elements in any order. The beauty is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array elements and converts them to strings.
   - It prints the sorted array elements as a space-separated string.

3. **Issue**:
   - The program does not calculate the beauty of the array.
   - Instead, it simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which does not address the problem of finding the maximum beauty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the largest elements are placed first.
   - The beauty can then be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Expected Output**:
   - For each test case, the program should output a single integer representing the maximum beauty of the array.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary calculations to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
