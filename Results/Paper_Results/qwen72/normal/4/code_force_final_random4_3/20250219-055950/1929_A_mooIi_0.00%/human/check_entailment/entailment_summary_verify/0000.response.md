Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func` does not perform the required calculation to determine the maximum beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the correct behavior according to the problem description. The problem requires calculating the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The current implementation of the function does not perform this calculation and thus does not produce the correct output.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Calculate the maximum beauty by summing the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.
3. Print the calculated maximum beauty for each test case.

The current function only sorts and prints the elements, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
