Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.**

The code snippet reassigns the variable `ar` to a new map object. This map object contains the sorted list of integers from the input, which are then converted to strings. The values of `_` and `n` remain unchanged.
