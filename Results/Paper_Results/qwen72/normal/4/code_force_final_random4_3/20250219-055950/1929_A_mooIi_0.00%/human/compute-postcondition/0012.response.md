Output State: **`_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The loop counter `_` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variable `n` will hold an integer value that is greater than or equal to 2, as it is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input.
- The variable `ar` will be a map object that contains the sorted list of integers from the input, with each integer converted to a string. This map object is created and used in each iteration to print the sorted list of integers.
