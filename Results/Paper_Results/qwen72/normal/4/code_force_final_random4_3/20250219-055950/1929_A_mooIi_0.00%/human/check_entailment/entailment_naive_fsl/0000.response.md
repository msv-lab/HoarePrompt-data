Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements. This does not match the required output, which should be the maximum beauty value of the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2
2 1
```
The expected output is `1` (as the maximum beauty of the array [2, 1] is 1), but the program will sort the array to [1, 2] and print the elements, which is not the correct output format or value.

The program should calculate the maximum beauty by rearranging the elements of the array to maximize the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The current implementation does not do this.
