Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 100`) and a list of `n` integers. It sorts these integers in ascending order, converts them to strings, and prints them separated by spaces. The function does not return any value; it only performs the described input and output operations. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the sorted lists of integers for each test case have been printed. **
