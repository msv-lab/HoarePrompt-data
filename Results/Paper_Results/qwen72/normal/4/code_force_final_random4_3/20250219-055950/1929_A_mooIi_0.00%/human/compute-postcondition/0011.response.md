Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(ar))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ar` is a map object. This means it is the result of applying a function (in this case, `str`) to each element of a list.
   - The list is sorted and contains integers from the input.
   - The `map` function converts each integer in the sorted list to a string.
   - The `join` method is used to concatenate these string elements into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `ar` is a map object that converts each element of the sorted list of integers to strings, the `join` method will concatenate these string representations of the integers.
   - The final output will be a single string where each integer from the sorted list is separated by a space.

Given the initial state, the output will be the space-separated string representation of the sorted list of integers from the input.

Output: **" ".join(ar) (where ar is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings)**

To make it more precise:
- If the input list of integers is `[5, 3, 1, 4, 2]`, the sorted list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The map object will convert this list to `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
- The `join` method will then produce the string `"1 2 3 4 5"`.

Output: **"1 2 3 4 5" (where the integers are the sorted input integers converted to strings)**

Since the exact input integers are not provided, the output will be a space-separated string of the sorted input integers.
