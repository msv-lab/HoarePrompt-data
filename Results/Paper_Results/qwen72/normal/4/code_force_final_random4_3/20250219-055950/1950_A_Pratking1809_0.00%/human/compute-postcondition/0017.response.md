Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
- If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true.
- Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NONE')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
