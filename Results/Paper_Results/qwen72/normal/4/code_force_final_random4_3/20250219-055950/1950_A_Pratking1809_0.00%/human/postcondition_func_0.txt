The function `func` reads an integer `q` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `q` as the number of test cases processed, `i` as `q-1` (the last index of the loop), and `mn` remains 100. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after each iteration.
