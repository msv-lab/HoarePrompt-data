Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `mn` is 100.
- The condition `a < b < c` does not hold true.
- The current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`.

Given this state, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'PEAK'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, and `mn` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **PEAK**
