The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `q` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mn` is 100, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds true. Otherwise, if `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true. If neither `a < b > c` nor `a < b < c` holds true, then neither condition is satisfied.**
