You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is an integer such that 0 <= q <= 1000, `i` is `q-1`, `mn` is 100, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. For each iteration, if `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds true and 'PEAK' is printed. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds true, 'NONE' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `q` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `q` as the number of test cases processed, `i` as `q-1` (the last index of the loop), and `mn` remains 100. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program has a logical error in the way it checks the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". The issue arises because both conditions are checked using separate `if` statements, which means that if both conditions are true (e.g., `a < b < c` and `a < b > c`), the program will print both "STAIR" and "PEAK" for the same test case, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 2 2
```
The program will incorrectly print "STAIR" and "PEAK" for this input, whereas it should only print "NONE" since the digits do not form a strict stair or peak.

To fix this, the conditions should be checked using `elif` to ensure that only one condition is evaluated at a time, and the `else` clause should handle the "NONE" case. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
