Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mn` is 100. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.***
