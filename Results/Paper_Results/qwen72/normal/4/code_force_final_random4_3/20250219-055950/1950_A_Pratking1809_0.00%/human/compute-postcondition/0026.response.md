Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is an integer such that 0 <= q <= 1000, `i` is `q-1`, `mn` is 100, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. For each iteration, if `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds true and 'PEAK' is printed. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds true, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `q` iterations, the variable `t` remains within its initial range (1 to 1000), the variable `q` is the total number of iterations that the loop performed, the loop index `i` is one less than `q` (since the loop index starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and `mn` remains unchanged at 100. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the user input for each iteration. For each iteration, the loop checks the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c`. If the first condition is true, 'STAIR' is printed. If the second condition is true, 'PEAK' is printed. If neither condition is true, 'NONE' is printed.
