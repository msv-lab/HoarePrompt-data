Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
- If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true.
- Otherwise, if `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` holds true.
- If neither `a < b > c` nor `a < b < c` holds true, then neither condition is satisfied.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Output:
Output: **PEAK**
