Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mn` is 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. If the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.**
