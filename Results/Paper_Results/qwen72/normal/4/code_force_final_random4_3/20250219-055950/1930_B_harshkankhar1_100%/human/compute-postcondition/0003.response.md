The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the output is dependent on an integer `n` which is constrained such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. Since the output is not specified in the provided information, it's not possible to describe the return value accurately. Assuming the function is supposed to return something based on `n`, we can only speculate based on the constraint. If you can provide the actual output based on `n`, I can refine the description.

Given the current information:
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified, but it is implied to be dependent on an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 10^5.**
