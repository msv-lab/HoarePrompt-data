You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Let's illustrate this with a few examples:
    #
    #- If `n = 3`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. Reversing the odd-indexed elements results in `[1, 2, 3]` (since there's only one odd-indexed element, it remains the same).
    #- If `n = 4`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Reversing the odd-indexed elements results in `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.
    #- If `n = 5`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Reversing the odd-indexed elements results in `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.
    #
    #Given the general case, the output will be the list `a` with the odd-indexed elements reversed. The exact values will depend on the value of `n`.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is an odd number correctly. Specifically, the permutation generated by the program for odd `n` does not ensure that there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. 

For example, consider `n = 5`:
- The program generates the permutation `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- Here, `p_1 = 5` and `p_3 = 3` do not divide each other, but `p_2 = 2` and `p_4 = 4` do divide each other, and `p_3 = 3` and `p_5 = 1` do not divide each other. However, the condition `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` is violated for `i = 1` and `j = 3` because `p_2 = 2` divides `p_4 = 4`.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
