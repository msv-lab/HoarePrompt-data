The value of `a` is assigned a list of integers starting from 1 up to and including the integer value provided by `input()`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to the integer value provided by `input()` inclusive.**
