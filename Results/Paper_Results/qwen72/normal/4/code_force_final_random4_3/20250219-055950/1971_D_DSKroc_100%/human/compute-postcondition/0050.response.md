Postcondition: **`s` is an input binary string of length 1 to 500, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count` is the number of positions where the integer value of `s[i]` is not equal to the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`, `flag` is 0, indicating that there does not exist any position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`, `q` is `t`, and `t` remains the same.**
