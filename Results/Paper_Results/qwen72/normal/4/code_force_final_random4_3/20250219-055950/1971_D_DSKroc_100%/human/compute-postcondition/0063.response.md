Postcondition: **`s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1, `i` is 0, `q` is `t + 1`, `t` remains the same, `flag` is 0. The first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is less than the second character of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`). If the first two characters of `s` are different, `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
