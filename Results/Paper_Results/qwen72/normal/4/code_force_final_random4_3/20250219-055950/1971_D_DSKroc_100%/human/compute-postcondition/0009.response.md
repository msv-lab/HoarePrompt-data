Postcondition: **`s` is an input binary string of length at least 2, `i` is 0. The first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`, and the integer value of the first character of `s` is less than the integer value of the second character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
