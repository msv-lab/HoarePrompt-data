Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is `t + 1`, `t` remains the same, and `count` is the number of positions in `s` where the character at position `i` is different from the character at position `i + 1`. If `flag` is 0, `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, `flag` is set to 1.***
