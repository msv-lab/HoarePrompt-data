Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be:

```python
def func(s):
```

With this correction, the precondition remains as stated above.
