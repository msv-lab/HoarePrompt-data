Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1, `i` is 0, `q` is `t + 1`, `t` remains the same, `flag` is 1 if the first character of `s` is less than the second character, otherwise `flag` is 0. If the first two characters of `s` are different, `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
