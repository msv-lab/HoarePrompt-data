The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, t is in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
