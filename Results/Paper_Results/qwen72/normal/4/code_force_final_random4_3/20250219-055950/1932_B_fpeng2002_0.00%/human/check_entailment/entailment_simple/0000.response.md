### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The function initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign will occur.
   - It then iterates over each periodicity in `nums` and updates `start_year` to the next multiple of the current periodicity that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
   - This ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign, as required by the problem statement.

3. **Mathematical Correctness:**
   - The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
   - This is because:
     - `start_year + 1` is the year after the last sign occurred.
     - `// nums[x]` performs integer division, giving the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that fit into `start_year + 1`.
     - Adding 1 to the result of the integer division ensures we move to the next cycle.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year of the next occurrence of the sign.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as the loop will only run once and `start_year` will be updated to the first multiple of `nums[0]`.
   - The function also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, as it will correctly update `start_year` to `n` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
