The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least one element.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1**
