Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `num_tests` remains `t - 1`, where `t` is an integer in the range from 1 to 1000, and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `n` is still an input integer, and its value has not been changed by the loop.
- The variable `nums` is still a list of integers provided by the user, and it must have at least one element.
- The variable `start_year` has been updated to the result of the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, where `nums[len(nums) - 1]` is the last element in the `nums` list.
- The variable `x` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the `nums` list, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
