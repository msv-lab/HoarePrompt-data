Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs and the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and a list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.

3. **Calculation:**
   - For each sign, the function updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
   - This is achieved using the formula: `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
     - `// nums[x]` performs integer division to find the quotient.
     - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next multiple.
     - `* nums[x]` multiplies the quotient by the periodicity to get the next multiple.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated `start_year` for each test case.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - After the sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 5`
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`
  - `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - After the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - After the second sign: `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - After the third sign: `start_year = ((60 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - After the fourth sign: `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - After the fifth sign: `start_year = ((800 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - After the sixth sign: `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

The function correctly handles the input and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The logic and the output match the problem description and the provided examples.
