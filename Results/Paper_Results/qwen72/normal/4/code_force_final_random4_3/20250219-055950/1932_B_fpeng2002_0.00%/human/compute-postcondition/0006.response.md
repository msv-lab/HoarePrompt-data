The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. The variable `x` will start from 0, and `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
