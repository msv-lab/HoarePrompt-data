Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`. The list `nums` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` updates the list `nums` with new integer values provided by the user.
- The initial value of `nums` is no longer relevant.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, `x`) remain unchanged, but `x` is now `len(nums) - 1` based on the new `nums` list.
