Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- `num_tests` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `t - 2`.
- Since `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement.
- The values of `n`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x` remain unchanged.
