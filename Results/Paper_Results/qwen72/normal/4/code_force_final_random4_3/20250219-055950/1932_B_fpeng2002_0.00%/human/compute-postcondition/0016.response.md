Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be an integer provided by the user.
- The values of `num_tests`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0. This condition remains valid.
- The list `nums` is still a list of integers provided by the user with at least one element.
- The value of `start_year` is still calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`.
- The value of `x` is still `len(nums) - 1`.
