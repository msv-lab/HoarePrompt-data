Postcondition: ***`k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the value of `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a sorted version of `a` in descending order. If the first element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 1. If the second element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains 0.***
