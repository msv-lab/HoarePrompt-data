Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `sorted_a` is a list (though its contents are not explicitly defined).
   - `favorite_value` is a value (though its exact value is not provided).
   - `removed_count` is increased by the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
   - `favorite_count` is the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
   - The current value of `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `k`, `i`, `sorted_a`, `favorite_value`, `removed_count`, and `favorite_count` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
