The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the second element of `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.**
