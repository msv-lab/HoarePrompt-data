Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and the value associated with each key is the minimum of `k` and the number of times that integer appears in `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations, the `arr` list and the integer `k` remain unchanged. The `frequency_table` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the `arr` list as a key. The value associated with each key will be the minimum of `k` and the number of times that integer appears in the `arr` list. This means that if an integer appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its frequency in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. If an integer appears fewer than or equal to `k` times, its frequency will be the actual count of its occurrences in `arr`.
