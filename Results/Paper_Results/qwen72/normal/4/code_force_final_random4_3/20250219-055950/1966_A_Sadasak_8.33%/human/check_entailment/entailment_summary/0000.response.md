Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations described in the problem. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards left is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, one operation can be performed to exchange all `n` cards, leaving `k - 1` cards.
   - If `k < n`, the program proceeds to calculate the frequency of each card number using the `func_1` function.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` but ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`. This is because if a card number appears more than `k` times, it can be exchanged in multiple operations, but the maximum frequency we need to consider for a single operation is `k`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if any card number appears exactly `k` times.
   - If a card number appears exactly `k` times, one operation can be performed to exchange these `k` cards, leaving `k - 1` cards.
   - If no card number appears exactly `k` times, the program outputs `n` as the minimum number of cards left.

However, there is a logical flaw in the final output logic. The program should not output `n` if no card number appears exactly `k` times. Instead, it should consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards. The correct approach would be to sum the frequencies that are multiples of `k` and subtract the corresponding number of cards exchanged.

### Corrected Logic:
- For each test case, calculate the frequency of each card number.
- Sum the frequencies that are multiples of `k` and subtract the corresponding number of cards exchanged.
- The remaining cards will be the minimum number of cards left.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`, the frequencies are `{4: 3, 1: 2}`. Since `4` appears exactly `3` times, one operation can be performed, leaving `2` cards.
- For the input `1 10 7`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `1`.
- For the input `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`, the frequencies are `{4: 1, 2: 2, 1: 1, 100: 1, 5: 1, 3: 1}`. Since `2` appears exactly `2` times, one operation can be performed, leaving `1` card.
- For the input `10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the frequencies are `{1: 10}`. Since `1` appears `10` times, we can perform two operations, leaving `2` cards. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
