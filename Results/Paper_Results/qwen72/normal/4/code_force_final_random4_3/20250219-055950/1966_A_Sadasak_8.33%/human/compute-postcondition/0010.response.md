The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the third element of `arr`, and the length of `arr` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` from the previous iteration as a key, `num` is the third element of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is greater than 2.**
