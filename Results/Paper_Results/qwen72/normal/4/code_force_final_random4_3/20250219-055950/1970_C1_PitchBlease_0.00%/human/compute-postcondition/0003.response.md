Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0.** 

The code snippet has updated the `current` variable to the value of `start` and the `dist` variable to 0, and the `queue` has been modified by removing the first element, which was the tuple `(start, 0)`. The `visited` set still contains the integer `start`, and the other initial conditions remain unchanged.
