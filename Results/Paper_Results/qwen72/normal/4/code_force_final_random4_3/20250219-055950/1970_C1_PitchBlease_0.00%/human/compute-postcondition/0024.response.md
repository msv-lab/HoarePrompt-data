Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it must contain at least one element, but the first element has been removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, and `dist` is 1. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns 1. Otherwise, `current` is not equal to `target` and the function does not return 1.***
