Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, where `distance` is the number of steps taken to reach `neighbor` from `start`. The `queue` will contain at least one element if there are still unvisited nodes in the graph. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is the last node that was processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the loop continues until all reachable nodes have been visited or the `queue` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is still a dictionary representing the graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed, with their respective distances from `start`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns the distance `dist`, which is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph. If `current` does not equal `target` and the `queue` is empty, the function will exit the loop without finding the `target`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
