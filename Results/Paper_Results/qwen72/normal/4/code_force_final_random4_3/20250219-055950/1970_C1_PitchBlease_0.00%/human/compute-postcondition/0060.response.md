Functionality: ** The function `bfs` accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, and a dictionary `tree` representing a graph. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node in the graph. If the `target` node is found, the function returns the shortest path distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, the function returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node. The function does not modify the `tree` dictionary or the `start` and `target` integers. **
