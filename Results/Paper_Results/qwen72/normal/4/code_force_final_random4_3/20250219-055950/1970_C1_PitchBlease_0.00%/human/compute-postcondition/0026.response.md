Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it must contain at least one element, but the first element has been removed, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially, `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, `dist` is 1, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of `current` that is not in `visited`.**
