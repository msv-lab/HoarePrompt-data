The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers within the range 1 to n, inclusive. The function also implicitly uses a parameter `tree`, which is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the distance `dist` associated with the current node `current` from the `start` node. If `current` equals `target`, this distance is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph represented by `tree`. If `current` does not equal `target`, the returned distance is the distance to the first node processed from the `queue` after the first element was removed.
- **Case_4**: The function returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the graph, and the search concluded without finding a path from the start node to the target node.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, and a dictionary `tree` representing a graph. It returns 0 in some unspecified case, 1 in another unspecified case, the shortest path distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is found, or the distance to the first node processed from the queue if `target` is not immediately found. If the target node is not found in the graph, it returns -1.**
