Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 1.
- **`_`**: Remains 0.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer.
- **`a`**: Initially, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed. The loop continues to remove trailing zeros from the list until there are no more trailing zeros left. If the list becomes empty due to all elements being zeros, the loop will stop.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` is the length of the modified list `a` minus 1. If the list `a` is empty, `i` will be -1.
- **`res`**: Remains 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
