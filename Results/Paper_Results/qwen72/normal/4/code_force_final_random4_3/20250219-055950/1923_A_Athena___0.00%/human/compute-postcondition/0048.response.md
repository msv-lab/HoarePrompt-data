Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, it is now removed. The length of `a` is decreased by 1, so `i` is updated to `len(a) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
