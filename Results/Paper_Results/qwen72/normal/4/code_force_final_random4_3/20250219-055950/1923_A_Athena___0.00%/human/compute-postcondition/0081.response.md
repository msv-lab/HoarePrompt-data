Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1` (reduced by the number of leading zeros and all trailing zeros).
   - `res` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `a` is described as a list of integers with all leading zeros and all trailing zeros removed.
   - Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information.
   - The list `a` will contain the integers from the original list, but without any leading or trailing zeros.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` after removing all leading and trailing zeros.
   - The exact elements of the list `a` are not known, but we know it will be a list of integers without leading or trailing zeros.

Output: **a (where a is a list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed)**
