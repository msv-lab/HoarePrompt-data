The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and no trailing zeros, and `i` is `len(a) - 1` (reduced by the number of leading zeros and one trailing zero, then further reduced by 1), the length of `a` will be reduced by 1 after the last element is removed. The value of `i` will therefore be `len(a) - 2` after the code is executed. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and no trailing zeros, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and `res` is 0.**
