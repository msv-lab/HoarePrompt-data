To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(a)):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `a` (specifically, the length of `a`)

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed
- `i` is 1
- `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0. If the first element of `a` is not 0, `res` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the length of `a` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a non-empty list, so `len(a)` is at least 1

For the loop to execute again:
- `i` will be incremented to 2
- `len(a)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, and `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0. If the first element of `a` is not 0, `res` remains 0.**
