Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where chips are not initially in a single block but can be moved to form a single block with the minimum number of operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
The correct output should be `3`, as you can move the chips from positions 2, 4, and 6 to positions 3, 4, and 5, respectively, to form a single block. However, the provided program will output `4`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of counting the number of operations. The program simply counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not consider the optimal way to move the chips to form a single block. The correct approach would involve calculating the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together, which is not what the current program does.
