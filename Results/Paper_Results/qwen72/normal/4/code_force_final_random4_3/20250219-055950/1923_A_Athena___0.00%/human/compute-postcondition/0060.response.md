Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2. If the third element of `a` is 0, `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains as it was initially: 2 if the first two elements of `a` are 0, 1 if only the first element of `a` is 0, and 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0.***
