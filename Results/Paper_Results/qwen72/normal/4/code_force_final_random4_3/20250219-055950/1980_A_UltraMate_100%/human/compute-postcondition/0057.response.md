Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by the number of key-value pairs in `hmp`, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The string `s` and the string `p` remain unchanged.
- The `hmp` Counter object still contains the frequency of each character in `s`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by the total number of unique characters in `s` (i.e., the number of key-value pairs in `hmp`).
- The variable `ans` is updated to include the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `hmp`, plus the sum of the differences `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where the frequency `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
