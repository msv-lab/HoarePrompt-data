### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counter Usage:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is not in the `Counter` object `hmp`, it means Vlad has no problems of that difficulty level, so he needs `m` new problems for each of the `m` rounds.

4. **Additional Calculation:**
   - For each difficulty level `i` that is in the `Counter` object `hmp`, if the count of that difficulty level is less than `m`, the program calculates the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` problems per round.
   - It adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is sound. It first accounts for missing difficulty levels and then for insufficient counts of existing difficulty levels.
- The use of `Counter` simplifies the frequency counting and makes the program more readable.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
