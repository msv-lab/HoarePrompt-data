Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least three keys, `i` is the third key in `hmp`. If the frequency of `i` in `s` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
