To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG'.
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
   - `ans` is increased by the total of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is a positive integer, but it is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `n` and `m` are integers, where `m` is used in the calculation of `ans`.
   - `s` is a string, and `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each character in `s`.
   - `p` is a string 'ABCDEFG', but it is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `ans` is a variable that is modified based on the frequency of characters in `s`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`, if the frequency of `i` (i.e., `hmp[i]`) is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - This means `ans` is the sum of the differences `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `s` that have a frequency less than `m`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the above calculation.
   - The value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `m` and the frequencies of characters in `s`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for each character `i` in `s` that has a frequency less than `m`)**
