The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `_`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` has been incremented by the number of key-value pairs in `hmp`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `_` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `t` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
