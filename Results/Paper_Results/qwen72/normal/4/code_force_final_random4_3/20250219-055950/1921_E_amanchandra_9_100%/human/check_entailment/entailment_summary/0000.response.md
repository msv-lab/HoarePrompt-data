### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Draw:**
   - The program first checks if Alice's chip is already in a row below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If this is the case, the game will end in a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet. This is a correct initial check.

2. **Calculating the Number of Moves:**
   - The program calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions by 2 (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`). This represents the number of moves each player can make towards each other before they potentially meet.

3. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), the program checks if Alice can move to a position within a certain range of Bob's chip's column. Specifically, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`. It then checks if Alice's chip can move to a position within this range (`abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`). If Alice can move to such a position, the program prints 'Alice', otherwise 'Draw'.
   - This logic is correct because if the difference in rows is odd, Alice will make the last move, and she needs to be able to move to a position where Bob's chip can be captured.

4. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is even, the program checks if Bob can move to a position within a certain range of Alice's chip's column. Specifically, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`. It then checks if Bob's chip can move to a position within this range (`abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`). If Bob can move to such a position, the program prints 'Bob', otherwise 'Draw'.
   - This logic is correct because if the difference in rows is even, Bob will make the last move, and he needs to be able to move to a position where Alice's chip can be captured.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the chips are in the same row but different columns. For example, if `a == c` and `b != d`, the program will correctly determine the outcome based on the column positions and the number of moves.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case correctly. It outputs 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
