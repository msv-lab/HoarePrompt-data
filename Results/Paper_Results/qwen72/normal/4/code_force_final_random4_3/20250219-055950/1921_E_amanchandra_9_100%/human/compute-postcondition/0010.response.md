Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
   - `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, with `1 <= h <= 10^6` and `1 <= w <= 10^9`.
   - `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h` and `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.

2. **New Variables**:
   - `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are assigned values from the input split by spaces.
   - `a` is an integer and `a <= c`.
   - `x` is assigned the value `abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Since the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `abs(a - c)` is an odd number.
   - Dividing an odd number by 2 using integer division (`//`) results in a value `x` such that `x = (abs(a - c) - 1) // 2`.
   - `l` is assigned the value `max(1, d - x)`.
   - `r` is assigned the value `min(w, d + x)`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement uses a conditional expression to decide what to print.
   - The condition is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `['Draw']`.

5. **Analyzing the Condition**:
   - `l` is calculated as `max(1, d - x)`.
   - `r` is calculated as `min(w, d + x)`.
   - The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` checks if `b` is within `x + 1` units of `l`.
   - The condition `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` checks if `b` is within `x + 1` units of `r`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The output depends on whether both conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are satisfied.
   - If both conditions are true, the output will be `Alice`.
   - If either condition is false, the output will be `Draw`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `r`, and `x` without specific input values. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions provided.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (where the output is determined by the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`, with `l = max(1, d - x)`, `r = min(w, d + x)`, and `x = (abs(a - c) - 1) // 2`)**.
