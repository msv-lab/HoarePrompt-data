Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('Draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Draw'` to the console. The values of the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not used in this specific `print` statement, and the condition involving `_` and `t` does not affect the output of this statement.

Output: **Draw**
