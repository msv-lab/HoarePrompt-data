Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. If `a <= c`, `x` is assigned the value of the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Otherwise, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, and `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.***
