Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` retain their initial values. The loop variable `_` will have been incremented `t` times, and the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will have been reassigned `t` times, each time based on the input provided during that iteration. If `a > c` in any iteration, the program prints 'Draw' and retains the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` for that iteration. If `a <= c`, `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. If `abs(a - c)` is odd, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The program then prints 'Alice' if the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are both true, otherwise it prints 'Draw'. If `abs(a - c)` is even, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `b - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. The program then prints 'Bob' if the conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are both true, otherwise it prints 'Draw'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all `t` iterations, the initial state variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged. The loop variable `_` will have been incremented `t` times, and the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will have been updated `t` times based on the input provided during each iteration. The loop will print 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions described for each iteration.
