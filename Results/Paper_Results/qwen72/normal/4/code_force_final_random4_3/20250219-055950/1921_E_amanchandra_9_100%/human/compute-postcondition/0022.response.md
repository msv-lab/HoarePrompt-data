Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input, `x` is assigned the value of the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2, `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
- The values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain the same as they were assigned from the input.
- The value of `x` remains the same as it was calculated from the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2.
- The value of `l` remains the same as it was assigned the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.
