### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `r` (height of the board), `w` (width of the board), `a` (Alice's initial row), `b` (Alice's initial column), `c` (Bob's initial row), and `d` (Bob's initial column).
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if a > c` checks if Alice's initial row is greater than Bob's initial row. If this is true, it means Alice cannot win because she is already below Bob, and Bob can always move up to avoid Alice. Therefore, the game will end in a draw.
   - This is a valid check and correctly identifies a draw scenario.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's initial rows by 2. This represents the number of moves it would take for both players to meet if they move optimally towards each other.
   - This calculation is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is odd, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Bob can move to in `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice's column `b` is within the range of columns that Bob can move to in `x + 1` moves. If it is, Alice can win by moving to one of these columns. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` is correct: `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`.
   - The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is used to check if Alice can move to a column within Bob's range in `x + 1` moves. However, this condition is incorrect. It should be `l <= b <= r` to check if Alice's column is within the range of columns Bob can move to in `x` moves.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is even, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Alice can move to in `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's column `d` is within the range of columns that Alice can move to in `x` moves. If it is, Bob can win by moving to one of these columns. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` is correct: `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`.
   - The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is used to check if Bob can move to a column within Alice's range in `x` moves. However, this condition is incorrect. It should be `l <= d <= r` to check if Bob's column is within the range of columns Alice can move to in `x` moves.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print('Alice' if l <= b <= r else 'Draw')
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print('Bob' if l <= d <= r else 'Draw')
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was mostly correct but had a critical flaw in the conditions used to check if Alice or Bob can win. The conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` are incorrect and should be replaced with `l <= b <= r` and `l <= d <= r` respectively.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
