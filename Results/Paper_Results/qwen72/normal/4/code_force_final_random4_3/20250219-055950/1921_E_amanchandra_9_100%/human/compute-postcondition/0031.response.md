The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state mentions several variables (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `_`, and `t`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **Draw**
