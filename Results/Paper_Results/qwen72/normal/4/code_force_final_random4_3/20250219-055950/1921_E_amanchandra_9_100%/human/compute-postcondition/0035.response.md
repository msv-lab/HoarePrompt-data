Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `r`, `w`, `b`, `d`, `a`, `c`, `_` are unchanged.
- `x` is defined as \((\text{abs}(a - c) // 2)\).
- `l` is defined as \(\text{max}(1, d - x)\).
- `r` is defined as \(\text{min}(w, d + (\text{abs}(a - c) // 2))\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`**:
   - `x` is \((\text{abs}(a - c) // 2)\).
   - This means `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2.

2. **Calculate `l`**:
   - `l` is \(\text{max}(1, d - x)\).
   - This means `l` is the maximum of 1 and the result of `d - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r` is \(\text{min}(w, d + (\text{abs}(a - c) // 2))\).
   - This means `r` is the minimum of `w` and the result of `d + x`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - The condition in the `print` statement is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - This condition checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

5. **Determine the Output**:
   - If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is `True`, the `print` statement will output `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, the `print` statement will output `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `c`, `d`, `b`, and `w` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `l`, and `r`. However, we can describe the output based on the given condition.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (where the output is determined by the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`, with `x` being \((\text{abs}(a - c) // 2)\), `l` being \(\text{max}(1, d - x)\), and `r` being \(\text{min}(w, d + (\text{abs}(a - c) // 2))\))**
