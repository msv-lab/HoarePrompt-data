The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, such as `def func(t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. Each of these parameters must satisfy the conditions: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.
