Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input, `x` is assigned the value of the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2, `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time (unchanged).
- `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `b + x` (updated).
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input (unchanged).
- `x` is assigned the value of the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2 (unchanged).
- `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `b - x` (unchanged).
