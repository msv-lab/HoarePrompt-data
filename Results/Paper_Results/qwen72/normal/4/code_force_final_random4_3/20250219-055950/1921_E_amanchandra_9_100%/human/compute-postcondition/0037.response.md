Output State: **`r` is assigned the value `min(w, b + (abs(a - c) // 2))`, `w`, `b`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time, `a` and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input, `x` is assigned the value `(abs(a - c) // 2)`, `l` is assigned the value `max(1, b - x)`.**
