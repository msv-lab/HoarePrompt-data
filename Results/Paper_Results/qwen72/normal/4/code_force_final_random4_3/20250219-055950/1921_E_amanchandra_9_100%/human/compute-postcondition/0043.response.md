Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to determine the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, the dimensions of a board `r` and `w`, and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's chip at `(a, b)` and Bob's chip at `(c, d)`. The function then evaluates the positions of the chips and prints 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the following rules: If Alice's chip's row `a` is greater than Bob's chip's row `c`, the function prints 'Draw'. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, the function calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. If this difference is odd, the function checks if Alice's chip can move to a position within a certain range of Bob's chip's column, and prints 'Alice' if it can, otherwise 'Draw'. If the difference is even, the function checks if Bob's chip can move to a position within a certain range of Alice's chip's column, and prints 'Bob' if it can, otherwise 'Draw'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
