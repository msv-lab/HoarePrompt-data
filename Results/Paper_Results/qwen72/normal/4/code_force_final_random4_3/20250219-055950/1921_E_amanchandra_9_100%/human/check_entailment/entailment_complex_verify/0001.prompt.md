You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, such as `def func(t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. Each of these parameters must satisfy the conditions: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` retain their initial values. The loop variable `_` will have been incremented `t` times, and the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will have been reassigned `t` times, each time based on the input provided during that iteration. If `a > c` in any iteration, the program prints 'Draw' and retains the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` for that iteration. If `a <= c`, `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. If `abs(a - c)` is odd, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. The program then prints 'Alice' if the conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are both true, otherwise it prints 'Draw'. If `abs(a - c)` is even, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `b - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `b + x`. The program then prints 'Bob' if the conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are both true, otherwise it prints 'Draw'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to determine the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, the dimensions of a board `r` and `w`, and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's chip at `(a, b)` and Bob's chip at `(c, d)`. The function then evaluates the positions of the chips and prints 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the following rules: If Alice's chip's row `a` is greater than Bob's chip's row `c`, the function prints 'Draw'. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, the function calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. If this difference is odd, the function checks if Alice's chip can move to a position within a certain range of Bob's chip's column, and prints 'Alice' if it can, otherwise 'Draw'. If the difference is even, the function checks if Bob's chip can move to a position within a certain range of Alice's chip's column, and prints 'Bob' if it can, otherwise 'Draw'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `r` (height of the board), `w` (width of the board), `a` (Alice's initial row), `b` (Alice's initial column), `c` (Bob's initial row), and `d` (Bob's initial column).

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The first condition checks if Alice's initial row `a` is greater than Bob's initial row `c`. If this is true, it means Alice cannot win because she is already below Bob, and Bob can always move up to avoid Alice. Therefore, the game will end in a draw.
   - If `a` is not greater than `c`, the game proceeds to the next checks.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's initial rows by 2. This represents the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to meet if they move optimally towards each other.
   - If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, it means they will not meet exactly in the same row, and the game will end in a draw or a win based on the column positions.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is odd, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Bob can move to in `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice's column `b` is within the range of columns that Bob can move to in `x + 1` moves. If it is, Alice can win by moving to one of these columns. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is even, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Alice can move to in `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's column `d` is within the range of columns that Alice can move to in `x` moves. If it is, Bob can win by moving to one of these columns. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Initial Condition Check**:
  - The condition `if a > c` correctly identifies that if Alice is already below Bob, she cannot win because Bob can always move up to avoid her. This is a valid check.

- **Distance Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `x` as `abs(a - c) // 2` is correct for determining the number of moves it would take for both players to meet if they move optimally towards each other.

- **Odd Distance Case**:
  - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Bob's possible moves is correct.
  - The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is used to check if Alice can move to a column within Bob's range in `x + 1` moves. This is correct because Alice has one extra move to adjust her column position.

- **Even Distance Case**:
  - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Alice's possible moves is correct.
  - The condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is used to check if Bob can move to a column within Alice's range in `x` moves. This is correct because Bob has exactly `x` moves to adjust his column position.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given conditions and logic for determining the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
