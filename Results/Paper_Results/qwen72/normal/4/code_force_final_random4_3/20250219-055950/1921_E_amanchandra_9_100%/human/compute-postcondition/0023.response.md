Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.
2. `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.
3. `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input.
4. `x` is assigned the value of the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2.
5. `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.

### Variables and Their Values:
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided as input.
- `x` is calculated as `x = (abs(a - c) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `l = max(1, d - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `r = min(w, d + x)`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement uses a conditional expression to decide between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Alice']`.
- The condition is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
- If the condition is true, the list `['Alice']` is selected.
- If the condition is false, the list `['Draw']` is selected.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected list, so the print statement will print the elements of the list.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `x`**:
   - `x = (abs(a - c) // 2)`

2. **Calculate `l`**:
   - `l = max(1, d - x)`

3. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r = min(w, d + x)`

4. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - The condition is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - This condition checks if `b` is within a certain range defined by `l` and `r`, with a buffer of `x + 1`.

### Final Output:
- If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is true, the output will be `Alice`.
- If the condition is false, the output will be `Draw`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `w` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `l`, and `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `Alice` or `Draw` depending on the condition.

Output: **Alice or Draw (where the output is determined by the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`)**
