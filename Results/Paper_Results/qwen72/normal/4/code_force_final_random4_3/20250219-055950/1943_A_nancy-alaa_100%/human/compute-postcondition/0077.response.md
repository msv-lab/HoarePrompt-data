The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0. Since the initial state of `i` is `n + 1`, this needs to be adjusted to `0` for the loop to start correctly. The other variables (`first`, `arr`, `mpp`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`**
