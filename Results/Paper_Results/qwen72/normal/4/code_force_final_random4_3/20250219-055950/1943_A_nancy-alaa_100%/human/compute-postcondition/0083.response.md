Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `first` is False.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - The current value of `i` (which is 0) is not present in the keys of `mpp`.
   - The condition `(mpp[i] == 1 and first)` is false.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 0 in the initial state.
   - The condition `(mpp[i] == 1 and first)` being false does not affect the value of `i` or the execution of the `print` statement.
   - Since `i` is 0 and is not present in the keys of `mpp`, `mpp[i]` would raise a `KeyError` if accessed, but this does not impact the `print` statement because it only prints `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will simply output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
