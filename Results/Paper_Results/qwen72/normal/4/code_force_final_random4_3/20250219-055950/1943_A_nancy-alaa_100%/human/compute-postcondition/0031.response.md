Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and `first` is False. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `i`, and `first` remain unchanged. However, the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
