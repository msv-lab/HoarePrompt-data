Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `_` is a placeholder for the loop (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer that must be non-negative.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is False.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0.
   - The condition that `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary does not affect the value of `i` itself, as it is only a condition and not an assignment.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 0, the print statement will output 0.

Output: **0 (where i is 0)**
