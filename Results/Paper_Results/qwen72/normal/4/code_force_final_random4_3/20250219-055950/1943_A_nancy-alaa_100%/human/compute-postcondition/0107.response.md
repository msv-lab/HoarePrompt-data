Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer not in `mpp` keys or the smallest integer in `mpp` keys with a count of 1 where `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop will stop when it encounters the first integer `i` that is not in the keys of `mpp` (i.e., `i` is not in `arr`) or when it finds an integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is already True. This means `i` will be the smallest integer that satisfies either of these conditions.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`first`**: `first` will be set to True if the loop encounters an integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` and `i` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such integer is found, `first` will remain False.
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mpp`**: The Counter object `mpp` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
