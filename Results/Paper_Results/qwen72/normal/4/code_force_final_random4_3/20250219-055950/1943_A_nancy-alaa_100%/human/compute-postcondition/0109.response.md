The function `func` should accept two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`. Each integer in the list `a` is in the range 0 to n-1. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a result based on the elements in `a` and the value of `n`, with the constraint that each integer in `a` is in the range 0 to n-1, and the function can be called multiple times for different test cases, where the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
