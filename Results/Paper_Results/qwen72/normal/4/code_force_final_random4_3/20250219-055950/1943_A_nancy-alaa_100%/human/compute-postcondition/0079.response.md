Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- `n` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 0, but its specific value is not provided.
- `first` is explicitly set to False.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input, but the specific integers are not provided.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- The integer 0 is not present in the keys of `mpp`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 0, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
