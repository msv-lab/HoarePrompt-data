Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is either True or False depending on whether a unique integer was found in `arr` before the loop ended. The loop will execute again if the new `n` is greater than 0.**
