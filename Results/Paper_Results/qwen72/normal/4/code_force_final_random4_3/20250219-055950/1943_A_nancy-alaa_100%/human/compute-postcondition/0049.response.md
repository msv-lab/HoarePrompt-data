Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not 1 or `first` is false, the program continues without breaking.***
