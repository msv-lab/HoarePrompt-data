Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and `first` is False. If `i` (which is 2) is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
