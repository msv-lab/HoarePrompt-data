Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `a` and the number of elements `n`. The array `a` should be a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to n-1, and `n` is a positive integer. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

For the function to be properly defined based on the problem description, it should look like this:
```python
def game_score(a, n):
```
However, since the provided function definition is `def func():`, it does not align with the problem's requirements.
