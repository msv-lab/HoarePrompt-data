Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by determining the optimal MEX score for the game described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which matches the problem description.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX score. She will always try to include the smallest missing integer in the array `c` by ensuring that the smallest integer that appears only once is included.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX score. He will try to remove the smallest integer that appears only once from the array `a` to prevent Alice from including it in `c`.

4. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in the array `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
   - If such an integer is found, it is printed as the MEX score and the loop breaks.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in the array and it is the first such integer encountered, Alice will include it in `c` (indicated by setting `first = True`).
   - If another integer `i` appears exactly once and `first` is already `True`, it means Bob will remove this integer, and the current `i` is printed as the MEX score.

This logic ensures that both players play optimally, and the program correctly determines the MEX score for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
