Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[n - 3]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `i` is `n - 3`, so `ans[n - 3]` is now set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
