To determine the output state, let's break down the code and its impact step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1` which is 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet is: `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we can assume it returns some value based on the inputs `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - `suffZero` is a list with a single element [0].
   - `ol` is `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.

3. **Impact:**
   - `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - The value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is unknown, but it will be some integer.
   - Let's denote the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)` as `k`.
   - Therefore, `zeroInd` will be `2 * k`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0].
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 0.
   - `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is `2 * k` where `k` is the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.**
