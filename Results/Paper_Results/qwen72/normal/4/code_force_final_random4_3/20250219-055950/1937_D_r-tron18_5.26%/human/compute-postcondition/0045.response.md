Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`.
- `zeroInd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it remains unchanged.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, which simplifies to `func_1(preOne, 0)` because `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)` is 0.
- `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- The value of `ans[n - 2]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
