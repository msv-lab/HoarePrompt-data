Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`.**

Explanation:
- `oneInd` is assigned the value of `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.
- Since `zr` is 0, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd` remain unchanged.
