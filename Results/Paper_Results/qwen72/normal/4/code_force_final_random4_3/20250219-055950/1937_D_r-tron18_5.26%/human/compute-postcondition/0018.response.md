Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n` where `ans[n-1]` is `n + 1 - fi`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
- `zeroInd` is 0.
- `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- Therefore, `ans[n-1]` becomes `0 - func_1(preOne, 0) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0))`, which simplifies to `n + 1 - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
