The code snippet `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` calculates the value of `zeroInd` by summing the last two elements of the list `suffZero`.

Given the initial state:
- `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, i + 1]`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

Let's break it down:
- The last element of `suffZero` is `i + 1`.
- The second last element of `suffZero` is `0`.

So, `zeroInd` is calculated as:
- `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] = (i + 1) + 0 = i + 1`.

Since `i` is `n - 2`, we can substitute `i`:
- `zeroInd = (n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`.**
