Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0. `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0]. `ans` is a list of length `n`. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is 0. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * k`, where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.***
