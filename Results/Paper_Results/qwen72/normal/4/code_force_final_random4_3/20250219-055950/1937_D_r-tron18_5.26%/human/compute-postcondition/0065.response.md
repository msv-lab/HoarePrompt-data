Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]` assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to `zeroInd`.
- `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0]`.
- `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element in `suffZero`, which is `0`.
- Therefore, `2 * suffZero[-1]` is `2 * 0`, which equals `0`.
- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `0`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
