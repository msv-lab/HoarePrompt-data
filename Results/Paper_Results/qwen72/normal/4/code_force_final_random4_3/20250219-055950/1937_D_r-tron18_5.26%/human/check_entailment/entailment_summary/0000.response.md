### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions, let's break down the logic and flow of the program:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell, and the character is inverted after the move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for a pinball placed on the i-th cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`.
   - It is used to compute the cumulative effect of pinball movements based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
   - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the lists and calculating the time for each cell.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly initializes `pre` with the positions of '>' characters.
   - It uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which helps in calculating the cumulative positions of '>' characters.
   - The function `func_2` also maintains `suffZero` to keep track of the cumulative positions of '<' characters from the end of the string.
   - The logic for calculating the time for each cell involves comparing the number of '>' and '<' characters and using the `func_1` function to compute the necessary differences.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.
   - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is consistent with the rules given in the problem description.
   - The use of `preOne` and `suffZero` ensures that the cumulative effects of pinball movements are correctly accounted for.
   - The function `func_1` is used appropriately to compute the necessary differences in positions.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of cumulative sums and the inversion of characters are handled correctly, and the output format matches the problem requirements.
