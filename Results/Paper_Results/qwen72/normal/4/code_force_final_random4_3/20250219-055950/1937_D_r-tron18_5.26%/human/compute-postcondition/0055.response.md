Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, n - 1]`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.** 

The code snippet assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. The value of `preOne[-1]` is the last element in the list `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`. Therefore, `oneInd` is twice the cumulative sum of the indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
