Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`). If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decreased by 1, the last element of `preOne` is removed, `ol` is set to `totalOne` plus 1, `zr` is 0, `ans[n-1]` is set to `n + 1 - fi`, where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is updated to [0, `n`], `ol` is set to `totalOne`, `zr` is set to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. If `zr` <= `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `n` + 0 and `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` > `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decreased by 1, `preOne` has one less element, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * k` where `k` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `2 * k - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to `[0, i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. Otherwise, `suffZero` is updated to `[0, n - 1]`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `(n - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0 (the last element is removed if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0] (if `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to [0, n - 2]), `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `zr` is 0 if `el` is '>', otherwise `zr` is 1. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` <= `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n - 2 + n - 2`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `n - 2 + n - 2 - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` > `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 3]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
