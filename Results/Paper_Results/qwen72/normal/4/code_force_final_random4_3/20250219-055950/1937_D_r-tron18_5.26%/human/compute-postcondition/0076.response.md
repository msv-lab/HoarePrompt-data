Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 2 + n - 2`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, 1)`**. 

The value of `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of the function `func_1` when called with `preOne` and `zr` (which is 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
