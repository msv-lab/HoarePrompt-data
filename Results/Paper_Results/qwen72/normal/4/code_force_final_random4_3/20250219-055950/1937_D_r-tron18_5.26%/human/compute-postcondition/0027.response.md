Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`) is '<', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n` + 0, `oneInd` is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr).**

Explanation:
- The code `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` introduces a new variable `oneInd` and assigns it the value `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `func_1(preOne, zr)` is a function call with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. The specific value of `func_1(preOne, zr)` is not provided, so we represent it as `func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- The value of `oneInd` is then `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
