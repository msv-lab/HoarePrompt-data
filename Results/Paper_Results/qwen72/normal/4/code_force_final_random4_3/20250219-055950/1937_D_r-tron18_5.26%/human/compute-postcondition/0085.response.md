The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1` and `n`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the input string `s1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`. The string `s1` consists of characters '<' and '>' and has a length `n` where 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the composition of the string `s1`.**
