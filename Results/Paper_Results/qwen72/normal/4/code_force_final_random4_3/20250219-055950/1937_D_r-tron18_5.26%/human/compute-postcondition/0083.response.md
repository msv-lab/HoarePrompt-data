Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is an empty list, `suffZero` is a list with the cumulative sums of indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '<', starting with 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element corresponds to the calculated value based on the loop logic for each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`s1`**: The string remains unchanged as it was initially, consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- **`n`**: The length of the string `s1` remains the same, within the given range.
- **`pre`**: This list contains the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', and it remains unchanged.
- **`totalOne`**: After all iterations, `totalOne` is 0 because the loop decrements `totalOne` each time it encounters a '>' character, and it processes all '>' characters in the string.
- **`preOne`**: This list, which initially contained cumulative sums of the indices of '>' characters, becomes empty after all iterations because the loop removes the last element of `preOne` each time it encounters a '>' character.
- **`suffZero`**: This list contains the cumulative sums of the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '<', starting with 0. The list is built up as the loop processes each '<' character from the end of the string to the beginning.
- **`ans`**: This list is filled with the calculated values for each index `i` from `n-1` to `0` based on the logic within the loop. Each element in `ans` is determined by the conditions and calculations specified in the loop for the corresponding character in `s1`.
