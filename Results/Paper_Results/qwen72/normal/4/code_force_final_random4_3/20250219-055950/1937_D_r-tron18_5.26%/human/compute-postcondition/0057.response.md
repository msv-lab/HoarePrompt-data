Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` <= `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. Otherwise, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, n - 1]`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `(n - 1) - (2 * preOne[-1])`.***
