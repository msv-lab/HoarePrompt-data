Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends a new value to the list `suffZero`.
- The last value in `suffZero` before the operation is 0.
- The value of `i` is `n - 3`.
- Therefore, the new value appended to `suffZero` is `0 + (n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
- The initial value of `suffZero` was `[0]`, and after the operation, it becomes `[0, n - 2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
