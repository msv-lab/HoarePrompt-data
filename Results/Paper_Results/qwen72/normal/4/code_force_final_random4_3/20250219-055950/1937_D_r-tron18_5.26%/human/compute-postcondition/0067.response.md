Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `oneInd` is updated by subtracting `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its original value.
- The original value of `oneInd` was `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- After the subtraction, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, which simplifies to `func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
