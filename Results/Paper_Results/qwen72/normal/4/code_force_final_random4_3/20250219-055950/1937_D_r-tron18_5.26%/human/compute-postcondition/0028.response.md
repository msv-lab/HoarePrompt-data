Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` where `ans[i]` is now `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`) is '<', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n` + 0, `oneInd` is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `ans[n-1]` is updated.
- `zeroInd` is `n` + 0, which simplifies to `n`.
- `oneInd` is 2 * func_1(preOne, zr), where `func_1` is a function that returns a value based on `preOne` and `zr`.
- The new value of `ans[n-1]` is `n - oneInd + n + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n - oneInd + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
