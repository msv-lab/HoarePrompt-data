Output State: **`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 minus `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`, and the current value of `a[l]` is 0.**
