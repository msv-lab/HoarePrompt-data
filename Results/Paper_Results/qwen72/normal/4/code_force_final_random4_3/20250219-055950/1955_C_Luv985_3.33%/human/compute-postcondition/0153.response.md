Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer minus `2 * mi` and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its original value.
- All other variables (`a`, `T`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `mi`, and `a[n-1]`) remain unchanged or retain their initial values and conditions.
