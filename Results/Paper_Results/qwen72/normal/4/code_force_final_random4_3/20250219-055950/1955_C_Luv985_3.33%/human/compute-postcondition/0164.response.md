Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`. Additionally, the current value of `mi - t - k // 2` is 0.**
