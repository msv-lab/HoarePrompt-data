Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 2, `k` is updated based on the initial conditions, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[r]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
