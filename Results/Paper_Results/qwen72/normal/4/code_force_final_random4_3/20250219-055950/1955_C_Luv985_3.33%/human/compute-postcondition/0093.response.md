Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` is 0 or not, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`. `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` is 0 or not, and if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0, `ans` is 2.***
