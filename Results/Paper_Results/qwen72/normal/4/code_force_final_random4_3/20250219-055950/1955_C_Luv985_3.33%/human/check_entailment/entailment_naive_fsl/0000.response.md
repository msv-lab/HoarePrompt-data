Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the Kraken attacks the last ship and it sinks, but the first ship is still intact. The program only checks if the first ship has sunk after reducing the durability of both the first and last ships, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 3
2 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1
```

The expected behavior is:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 1: `[1, 1, 2]`.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 1: `[1, 1, 1]`.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship again, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it: `[1, 1]`.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship again, reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it: `[1]`.

Thus, 2 ships should be sunk. However, the program only counts 1 ship as sunk because it does not correctly handle the case where the last ship sinks but the first ship is still intact.
