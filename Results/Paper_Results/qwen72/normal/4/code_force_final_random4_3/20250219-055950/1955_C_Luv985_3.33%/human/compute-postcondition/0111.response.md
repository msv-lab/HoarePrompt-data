Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions described. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the conditions described. In both cases, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**
