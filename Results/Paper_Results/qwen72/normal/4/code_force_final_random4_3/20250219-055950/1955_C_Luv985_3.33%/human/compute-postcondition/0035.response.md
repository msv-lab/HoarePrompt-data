Output State: **`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.** 

The value of `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
