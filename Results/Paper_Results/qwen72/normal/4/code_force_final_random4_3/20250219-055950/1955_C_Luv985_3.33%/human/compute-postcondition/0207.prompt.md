Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is the input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer that is less than the smallest value in the list `a` after all adjustments, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right. If `l` is equal to `r`, then `ans` is the number of elements in the list `a` that have been reduced to 0, plus 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`; otherwise, `ans` remains the same.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1, `r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1, and `ans` is an integer that counts the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. The loop will terminate when `l` is no longer less than `r` or `k` is no longer greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the initial conditions and the number of iterations, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right, and `ans` is the total number of elements that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
