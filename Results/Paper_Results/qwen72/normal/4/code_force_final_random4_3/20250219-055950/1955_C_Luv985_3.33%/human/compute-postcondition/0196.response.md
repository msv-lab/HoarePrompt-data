Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 2, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[l]` was initially 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[r]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` before any updates, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If `a[r]` was initially 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on whether `a[r]` is 0, and `ans` is updated to 1 or 2 depending on its initial value.**
