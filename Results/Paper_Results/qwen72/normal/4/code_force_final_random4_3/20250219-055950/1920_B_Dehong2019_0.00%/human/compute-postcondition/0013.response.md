Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

The value of `ans2` is now equal to the value of `ans1`, which is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
