Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, and `j` is 2. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `s`, `t`, `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
