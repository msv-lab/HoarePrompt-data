Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
   - `kp` is `kp + 2` (though `kp` is not used in the print statement).
   - `g` is 0 (though `g` is not used in the print statement).
   - `v2` is 3.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is not relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v2` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `v1` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` will be 2, and the print statement will output:
     ```
     ? 2 2 3 3
     ```
   - If `r` is not `<` (i.e., `r` is `>`, `=`, or any other value), then `v1` will remain 0, and the print statement will output:
     ```
     ? 0 0 3 3
     ```

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we need to consider both cases.
   - The output will be one of the two possible strings based on the value of `r`.

Output: **? 2 2 3 3 (if r is '<') or ? 0 0 3 3 (if r is not '<')**
