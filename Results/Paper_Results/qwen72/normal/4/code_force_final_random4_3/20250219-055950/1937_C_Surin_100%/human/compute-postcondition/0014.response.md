The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the input string provided by the user. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.**
