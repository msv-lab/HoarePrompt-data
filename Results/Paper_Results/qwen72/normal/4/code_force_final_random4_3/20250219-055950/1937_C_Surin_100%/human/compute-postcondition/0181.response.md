Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `r` is an input string, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is not equal to `>`, and the current value of `r` is `=`.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to be flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain the same.
