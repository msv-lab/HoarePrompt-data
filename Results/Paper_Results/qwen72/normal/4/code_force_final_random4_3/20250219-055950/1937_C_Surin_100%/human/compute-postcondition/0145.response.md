Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to a new input integer.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `prev` remains the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`.
- `kp` remains `kp + 2`.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v2` remains `n-1`.
- `r` remains the final input string.
- The output buffer has already been flushed and remains flushed.
- `v1` remains the value it was before, which is `n-1` if the previous `r` was `<`, or the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.
