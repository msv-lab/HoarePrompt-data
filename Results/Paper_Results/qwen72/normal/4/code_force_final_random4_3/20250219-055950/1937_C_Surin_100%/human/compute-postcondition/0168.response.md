Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, `v1` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `v1` being 3.
