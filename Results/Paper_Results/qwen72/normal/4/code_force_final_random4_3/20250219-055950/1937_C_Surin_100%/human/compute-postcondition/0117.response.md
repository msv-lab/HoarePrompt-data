The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is 0 or 1, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1. If `r` is `=`, `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was `<`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.**
