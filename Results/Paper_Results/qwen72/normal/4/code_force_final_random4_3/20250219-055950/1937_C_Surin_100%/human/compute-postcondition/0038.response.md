Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `r` is an input string, and it is given that `r` is equal to '='.
   - The output buffer has been flushed, which means any previous output has been written to the console.
   - `prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so it will raise a `NameError` when the print statement is executed.

Since `prev` is not defined, the print statement will raise a `NameError` and will not print anything. Therefore, the output is:

Output: **NameError: name 'prev' is not defined**
