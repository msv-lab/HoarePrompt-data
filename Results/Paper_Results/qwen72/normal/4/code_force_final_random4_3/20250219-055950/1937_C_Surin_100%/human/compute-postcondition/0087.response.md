Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`.
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0.
- `kp` is `kp + 1`.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 1.
- `v2` is 2.
- `r` is `<`.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that will print the characters `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2` separated by spaces.
- `v1` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `v2` is explicitly defined as 2.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `? 1 1 2 2`.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
