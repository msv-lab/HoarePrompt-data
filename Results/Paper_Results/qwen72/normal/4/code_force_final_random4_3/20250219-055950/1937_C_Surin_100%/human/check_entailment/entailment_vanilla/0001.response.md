### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - The goal is to use these queries to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \(v1\) such that \(p_{v1}\) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \(p_0 \mid p_0\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, \(v1\) is updated to \(i\).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - After finding \(v1\), the program tries to find another index \(prev\) such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized.
   - This is done by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), \(prev\) is updated to \(i\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), a further query is made to compare \(p_i \mid p_i\) with \(p_{prev} \mid p_{prev}\) to break the tie.

4. **Query Efficiency:**
   - The first loop to find \(v1\) uses \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop to find \(prev\) uses \(n-1\) queries in the worst case.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(2n-2\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

5. **Output:**
   - After finding \(v1\) and \(prev\), the program outputs the indices as "! prev v1".

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Finding \(v1\):**
  - The first loop correctly finds the index \(v1\) such that \(p_{v1}\) is the maximum value in the permutation. This is because \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\) and the loop updates \(v1\) whenever a larger value is found.

- **Finding \(prev\):**
  - The second loop correctly finds the index \(prev\) such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized. This is because the loop compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\) and updates \(prev\) when necessary.
  - The tie-breaking mechanism using the further query ensures that \(prev\) is updated correctly.

- **Query Count:**
  - The total number of queries is \(2n-2\), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\).

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format is correct, and the indices are printed as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, and it does so within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
