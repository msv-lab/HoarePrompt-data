Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and if `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- `v2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
