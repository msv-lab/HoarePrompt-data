Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or `prev`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
