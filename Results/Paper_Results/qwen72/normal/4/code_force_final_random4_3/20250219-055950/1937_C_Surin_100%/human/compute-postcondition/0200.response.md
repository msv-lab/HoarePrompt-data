The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2. If `r` is `=`, `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 2. Otherwise, if `r` is not `>` and not `=`, the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.**
