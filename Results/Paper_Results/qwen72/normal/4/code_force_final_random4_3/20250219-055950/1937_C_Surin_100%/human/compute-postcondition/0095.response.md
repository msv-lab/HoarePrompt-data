Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1 if `r` is not `<`, otherwise `v1` is 2, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the output stream immediately. This operation does not affect the values of any variables, so the initial state remains unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed, and all other variables retain their initial values.
