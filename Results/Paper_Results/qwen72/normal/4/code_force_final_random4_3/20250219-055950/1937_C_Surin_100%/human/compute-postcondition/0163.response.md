The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**
