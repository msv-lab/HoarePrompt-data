Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**

The value of `v2` is updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
