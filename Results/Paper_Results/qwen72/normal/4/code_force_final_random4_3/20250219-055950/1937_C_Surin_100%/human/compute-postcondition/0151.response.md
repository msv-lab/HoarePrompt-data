Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 1, `r` is the final input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `v1` is 0.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
