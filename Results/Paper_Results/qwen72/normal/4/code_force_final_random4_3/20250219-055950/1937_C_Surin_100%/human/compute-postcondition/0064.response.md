Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is an input string.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
