The function operates in an interactive environment where it receives input through queries and outputs indices. The input includes multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the size of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
