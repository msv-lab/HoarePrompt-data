To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is `=`, then `r2` is an input string.
     - If `r2` is `<`, then `prev` is 2.
     - Otherwise, if `r` is not `>` and not `=`, the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.

3. **Variables in the `print` statement:**
   - `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is determined based on the conditions for `r` and `r2`.

4. **Possible values for `prev`:**
   - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is not `>` and not `=`, `prev` remains unchanged (its initial value is not provided).

Since `v1` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific value for it. However, we can describe the output based on the known values of `i` and `prev`.

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the value of v1 and [prev] is 2 if r is '>' or if r is '=' and r2 is '<', otherwise [prev] remains unchanged)**
