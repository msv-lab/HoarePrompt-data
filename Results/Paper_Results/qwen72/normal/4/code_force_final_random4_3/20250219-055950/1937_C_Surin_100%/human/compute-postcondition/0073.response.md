The only object in the loop head is the variable `kp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `kp` and the result of `int(input())`. If `kp` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is the current value, and `int(input())` is the number of iterations the loop should run.

For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than `kp`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than `kp + 1`**
