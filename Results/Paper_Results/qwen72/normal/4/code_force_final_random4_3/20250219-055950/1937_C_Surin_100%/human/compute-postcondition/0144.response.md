The only objects in the loop head are the variables `kp` and the input integer from `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on whether `kp` is less than the input integer. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` was `kp + 1`, and `n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`.

To execute the loop one more time:
- `kp` must be incremented by 1.
- The input integer must still be greater than the new value of `kp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 2`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**
