The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007`**
