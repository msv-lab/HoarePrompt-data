The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means `t` is already non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one time without any adjustments.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the n \times n chessboard.**
