Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
2. `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `k` is an input integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
4. `i` is defined as `k - 1`.
5. `m` is defined as `n - num`.
6. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except:
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - `dp[i]` for \(3 \leq i \leq m\) is calculated as \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^4)\).
7. `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop, which is the sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r` for all `k` iterations.
8. `m` is explicitly given as 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `m`**: The initial state explicitly states that `m` is 1.
2. **List `dp`**: Since `m` is 1, the length of `dp` is `m + 1 = 2`.
   - `dp[0]` is 0 (default value).
   - `dp[1]` is 1 (as specified in the initial state).

3. **Value of `i`**: `i` is defined as `k - 1`. Since `k` is an input integer and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `i` can range from 0 to \(n - 1\).

4. **Calculation of `dp[i]`**: For \(3 \leq i \leq m\), the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^4)\) would be used. However, since `m` is 1, the only valid indices for `dp` are 0 and 1. Therefore, the formula is not applied for any `i` greater than 2.

5. **Print Statement**: The code snippet contains a simple `print(1)` statement. This statement will always print the integer 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, `dp`, or `num`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
