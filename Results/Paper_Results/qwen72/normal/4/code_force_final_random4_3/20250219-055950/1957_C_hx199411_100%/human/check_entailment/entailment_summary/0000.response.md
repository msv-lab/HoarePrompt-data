Reasoning:  
The program is designed to calculate the number of different final configurations of rooks on an `n \times n` chessboard, given the constraints and the mirroring behavior of the computer. The key points to verify for correctness are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case, including the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`. It also reads the initial moves `(r_i, c_i)` for each test case.

2. **Initial Move Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of positions already occupied by rooks (`num`). If a move is on the diagonal (i.e., `r_i == c_i`), it increments `num` by 1 because only one rook is placed. If the move is not on the diagonal, it increments `num` by 2 because both the player and the computer place a rook.

3. **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The program calculates the number of remaining positions `m` as `n - num`. This is correct because `num` represents the total number of occupied positions after the initial moves and the computer's responses.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of different final configurations. The base cases are:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board (one diagonal, two non-diagonal).

   For larger boards, the recurrence relation is:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`

   This relation is correct because:
   - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where the last rook is placed on the diagonal.
   - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` accounts for the configurations where the last rook is placed off the diagonal, and the computer mirrors the move, leaving `i - 2` positions to be filled in `dp[i - 2]` ways, with 2 choices for each pair of positions.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is `dp[m]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach is well-suited for this problem, and the recurrence relation is derived correctly.

Correctness: **True**
