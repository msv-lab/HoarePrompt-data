To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

1. **Identify the current state:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Determine the next state:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the state:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `k` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 2, `m` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
