The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since no information is provided about how `t` is modified within the loop, we cannot assume any specific change to `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must remain non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the function does not modify `dp`. If `m` is 1, the function does not modify `dp`. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`.**
