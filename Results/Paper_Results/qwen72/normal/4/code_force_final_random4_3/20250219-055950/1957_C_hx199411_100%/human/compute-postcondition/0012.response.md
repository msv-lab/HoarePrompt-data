The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is 2.**
