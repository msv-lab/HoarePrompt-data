Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp[m]` is the final computed value of the loop, and all elements `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` have been updated according to the loop formula.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i` is `m + 1`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will have incremented to `m + 1`. This is because the loop starts at `i = 3` and runs until `i` reaches `m + 1`.
- **`m` is `n - num`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is defined as `n - num` and is not modified within the loop.
- **`dp[m]` is the final computed value of the loop**: The `dp` list is updated in each iteration of the loop, and after the loop finishes, `dp[m]` will hold the final computed value based on the given formula.
- **All elements `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` have been updated**: Each element from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` will have been updated according to the loop formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This means that each element in the `dp` list from index 3 to `m` will have a value that is the result of the computation performed in the loop.
