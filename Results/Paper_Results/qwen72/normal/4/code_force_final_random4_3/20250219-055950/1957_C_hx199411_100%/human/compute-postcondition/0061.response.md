The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise it is 4. Therefore, after the code is executed, `num` will be 3 if `c` equals `r`, and 5 if `c` does not equal `r`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 2, `m` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`, `c` and `r` are specific input integers, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 5.**
