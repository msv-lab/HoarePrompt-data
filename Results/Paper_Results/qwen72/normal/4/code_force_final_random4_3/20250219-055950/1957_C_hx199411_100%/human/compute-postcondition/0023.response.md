Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- The initial values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged.
- `m` is now equal to `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`.
