The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. For the loop to continue executing, `m` must still be at least 3, but since `i` is now 4, `m` must be at least 4 to ensure `i` is less than `m + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 4, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
