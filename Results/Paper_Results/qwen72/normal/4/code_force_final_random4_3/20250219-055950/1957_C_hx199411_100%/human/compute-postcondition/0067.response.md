Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
2. `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `k` is an input integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
4. `i` is calculated as `k - 1`.
5. `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
6. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for \(3 \leq i \leq m\) is calculated as \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2] \cdot 2) \mod (10^4)\).
7. `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop, which is the sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r` for all `k` iterations.
8. `m` is 0.

### Analysis:
- Given that `m` is 0, this implies that `n - num = 0`, which means `n = num`.
- Since `m` is 0, the length of the `dp` list is `m + 1 = 1`.
- The `dp` list will only have one element, which is `dp[0]`, and since the list is initialized with all elements as 0, `dp[0] = 0`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(1)
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet simply prints the integer 1.
- The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, `dp`, and `num` do not affect the output of the `print(1)` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
