### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.

2. **Counting Valid Moves:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are already occupied by rooks.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, the computer skips its turn, so `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `r_i != c_i`, the computer places a rook at `(c_i, r_i)`, so `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board that are not yet occupied by rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - `dp[1]` is initialized to 1, representing the base case where there is only one position left, and the only configuration is placing one rook.
   - `dp[2]` is initialized to 3, representing the base case where there are two positions left, and the possible configurations are:
     - Placing a rook in one position and leaving the other empty.
     - Placing a rook in the other position and leaving the first empty.
     - Placing a rook in both positions.
   - For `m >= 3`, the program calculates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This recurrence relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions, considering the previous configurations and the new positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible final configurations for each test case, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for counting the number of occupied positions and calculating the remaining positions is correct.
- The dynamic programming approach used to calculate the number of possible final configurations is appropriate and follows the correct recurrence relation.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
