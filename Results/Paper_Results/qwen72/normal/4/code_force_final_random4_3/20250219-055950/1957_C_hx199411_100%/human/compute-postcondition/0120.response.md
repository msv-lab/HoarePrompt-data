Output State: **`i` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 6 * dp[2]) % 1000000007`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 4.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 4 is still valid.
- The value of `dp[3]` remains `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007`.
- `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + 6 * dp[2]) % 1000000007`, where `6` is derived from `(i - 1) * 2` since `i` is 4.
