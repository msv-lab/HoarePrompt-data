Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `c` and `r` are input integers. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `num` (if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1; otherwise, `num` is 2) is still valid, but `c` and `r` now have specific input values.
