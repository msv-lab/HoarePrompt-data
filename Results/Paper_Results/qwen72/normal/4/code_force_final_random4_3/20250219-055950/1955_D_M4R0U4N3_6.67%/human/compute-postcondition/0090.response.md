To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(m):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `r` is `n`
- `m` is greater than 1
- `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`
- `done` is a set containing the integer `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set
- `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` and, if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `a[1]` is also added to `extra`
- `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input
- `j` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
- `m` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue. Since `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is now 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The other variables and objects (`r`, `old`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, and `k`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`r` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the integer `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` and, if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `a[1]` is also added to `extra`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is 2**
