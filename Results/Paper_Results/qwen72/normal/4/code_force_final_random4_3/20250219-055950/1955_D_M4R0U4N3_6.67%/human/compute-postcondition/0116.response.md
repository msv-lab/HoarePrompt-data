The only variables in the loop head are `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `r` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `r`.

State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`. The state of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
