Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, and `old` is now `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old`, `done` has `old` removed from it, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, `done` includes `a[r]`, and if `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` is updated to include `a[r]`. `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1.***
