Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `r` is `n`. `m` is less than `n`. `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input. `done` is an empty set. `extra` is an empty set. `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**

The code snippet `extra = set()` reinitializes the `extra` variable to an empty set, overriding its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
