Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, and the state of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to `old`. Given that `r` is `m + 1`, the expression `r - m` simplifies to `1`. Therefore, `old` is assigned the value of `a[1]`. The values of `r`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true. The state of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` also remains unchanged.
