Postcondition: ***`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 2`. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `old` is not in `extra` and is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` now contains `old` and `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `done`), `extra` no longer contains `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `extra`), `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]` (if `a[r]` was in `todo`), otherwise `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `len(done) >= k`.***
