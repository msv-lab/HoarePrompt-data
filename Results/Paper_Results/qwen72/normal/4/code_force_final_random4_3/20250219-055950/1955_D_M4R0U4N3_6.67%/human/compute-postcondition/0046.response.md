Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `a`, `extra` (with `old` removed), `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

The value of `old` (which is `a[1]`) has been removed from the list `extra`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
