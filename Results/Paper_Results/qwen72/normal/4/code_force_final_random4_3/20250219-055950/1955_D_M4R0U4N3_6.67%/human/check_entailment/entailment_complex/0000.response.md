### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It reads the list `a` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It reads the list `b` and converts it to a set `todo` to keep track of the elements that need to be matched.

2. **Initial Subarray Check:**
   - The function initializes a set `done` to keep track of elements in the current subarray that match elements in `todo`.
   - It initializes a set `extra` to keep track of elements in the current subarray that do not match elements in `todo`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a`:
     - If an element is in `todo`, it is moved to `done` and removed from `todo`.
     - Otherwise, it is added to `extra`.

3. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 1 if the initial subarray is good (i.e., `len(done) >= k`), otherwise to 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m`:
     - It removes the element that is no longer in the current subarray (`old = a[r - m]`):
       - If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
       - If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
     - It adds the new element to the current subarray (`a[r]`):
       - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is moved to `done` and removed from `todo`.
       - Otherwise, it is added to `extra`.
     - If the current subarray is good (i.e., `len(done) >= k`), `ans` is incremented.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all subarrays, the function prints the count of good subarrays for the current test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly initializes the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to manage the elements of the subarray.
- The initial subarray check is performed correctly.
- The sliding window approach is used to efficiently update the sets as the subarray moves through `a`.
- The function correctly increments `ans` whenever a good subarray is found.
- The function handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
