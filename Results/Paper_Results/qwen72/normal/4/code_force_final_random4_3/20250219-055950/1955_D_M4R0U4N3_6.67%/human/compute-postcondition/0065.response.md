Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m + 1]`, `a` and `ans` remain unchanged, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, `done` now contains `a[r]`, `extra` remains unchanged if `old` is not in `done` or `extra`, otherwise the previous conditions for `done` and `extra` still hold.**
