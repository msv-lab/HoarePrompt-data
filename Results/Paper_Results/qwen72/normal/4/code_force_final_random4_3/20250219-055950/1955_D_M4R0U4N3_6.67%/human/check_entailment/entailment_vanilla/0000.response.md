### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It also initializes two sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that have been matched and elements that are not in `b`, respectively.

3. **First Subsegment**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` (the first subsegment).
   - If an element in this subsegment is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and initializes `ans` accordingly.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
     - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if true.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
  - It correctly updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as the window slides.
  - The condition `len(done) >= k` is used to determine if a subsegment is good, which aligns with the problem statement.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `m` or when `k` is 1.
  - It also handles cases where elements in `a` and `b` are not unique.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (add, remove, check membership) are efficient, typically O(1) on average.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
