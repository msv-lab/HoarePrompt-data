The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, `j` is 0**
