Postcondition: **`r` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, `j` is 0, and the current value of `a[j]` is in `todo`.**
