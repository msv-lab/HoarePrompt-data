Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `done` now contains `a[r]`, `todo` and `extra` remain unchanged unless `a[r]` was in `todo`, in which case `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
