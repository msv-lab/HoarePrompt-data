The only objects in the loop head are variables `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `r` and the range defined by `m` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m`, `m` is less than `n`, and `n` is the first integer input. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be incremented by 1 to `m + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than `m + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[0]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`, `done` is a set that may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop body, `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`**.
