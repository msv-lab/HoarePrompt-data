Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is `m-1`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[0]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` is updated to include `old`, and `done` is updated to exclude `old`. `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2, and the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra` and remains not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` remains 1, and `todo`, `done`, and `extra` retain their previous states.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[r - m]`, and `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, and `done` now includes `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` is updated to include `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`, `done` has `old` removed from it, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. If `old` is not in `extra` and not in `done`, `todo` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, and `old` is now `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old`, `done` has `old` removed from it, and `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, `done` includes `a[r]`, and if `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` is updated to include `a[r]`. `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
