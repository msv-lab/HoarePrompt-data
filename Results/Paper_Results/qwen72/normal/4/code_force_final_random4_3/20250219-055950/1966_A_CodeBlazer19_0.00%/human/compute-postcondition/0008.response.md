Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(k - 1)
```

This statement will print the value of `k - 1`, where `k` is an integer provided by the user. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the integer provided by the user)**
