The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `cards` and an integer `k`. The list `cards` represents the numbers on the cards and should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), with each element in `cards` being an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). The integer `k` represents the number of cards to exchange during each operation and should be within the range 2 ≤ k ≤ 100.

The function returns a modified version of the `cards` list after performing the specified operations. However, the specific operations and the resulting output are not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `cards` and an integer `k`, and returns a modified version of the `cards` list after performing operations that involve exchanging `k` cards.**
