Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `l` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer are still valid.
