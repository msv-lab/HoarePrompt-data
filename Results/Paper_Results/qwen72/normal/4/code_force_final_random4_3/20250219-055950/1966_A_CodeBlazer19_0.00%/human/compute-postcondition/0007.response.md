Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `l` to be a list of integers, where the integers are provided by the user as a space-separated string. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
