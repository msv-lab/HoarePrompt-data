Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `n` and `k` based on user input. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer. The values of `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `n` and `k` now hold the values provided by the user.
