You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The list `cards` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element in `cards` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: `t` iterations have completed, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last input integers, `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a hand of `n` cards, each with a number, and an integer `k`.
   - We can exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards with any number.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in the hand after performing any number of operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `l`.
   - The program then prints `k - 1` for each test case.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The program does not actually consider the card numbers or the number of cards with the same number.
   - It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left in the hand depends on the distribution of card numbers and the value of `k`.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to count the frequency of each card number.
   - For each unique card number, we need to determine how many cards we can exchange and how many will be left.
   - The minimum number of cards left in the hand is the sum of the remainders when the frequency of each card number is divided by `k`.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case: `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `l = [4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`
     - Frequency of 4: 3 (can be exchanged once, leaving 0 cards)
     - Frequency of 1: 2 (cannot be exchanged, leaving 2 cards)
     - Minimum cards left: 2
   - For the second test case: `n = 1`, `k = 10`, `l = [7]`
     - Frequency of 7: 1 (cannot be exchanged, leaving 1 card)
     - Minimum cards left: 1
   - For the fourth test case: `n = 10`, `k = 4`, `l = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Frequency of 1: 10 (can be exchanged 2 times, leaving 2 cards)
     - Minimum cards left: 2 (not 3 as the program outputs)

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the card numbers or their frequencies.
   - The output `k - 1` is not always the correct answer.
