Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 3, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1. If `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(x)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.***
