Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` is the smaller integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`, `y` is the larger integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `kq1` is now `kq1 + str(y)`, `kq2` is unchanged.**

The value of `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
