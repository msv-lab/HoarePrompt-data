Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is an input string that must have at least one character; `b` is an input string; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`.**
