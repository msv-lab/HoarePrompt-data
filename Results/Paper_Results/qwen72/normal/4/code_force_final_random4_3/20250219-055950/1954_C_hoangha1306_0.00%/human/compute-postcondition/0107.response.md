Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 3, `i` is 2, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1 if the second characters of `a` and `b` were different, otherwise `vt` remains 0.**
