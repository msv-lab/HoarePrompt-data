You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is `t - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of the same length as `a` and `b` where each character is determined by the rules specified in the loop. If `a[i]` == `b[i]` for any `i`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is `a[i]`. If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is either the smaller or larger of `a[i]` and `b[i]` based on the value of `vt` and the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where each string consists of digits from 1 to 9. The function then generates two strings `kq1` and `kq2` of the same length as `a` and `b`. For each character position `i` in `a` and `b`, if the characters are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` will have the same character at position `i`. If the characters are different, the first differing character in `kq1` and `kq2` will be the smaller and larger of the two characters, respectively, and subsequent differing characters will be swapped. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` in all cases. Specifically, the logic for swapping digits is flawed. The program only swaps digits if they are not equal, and it does so in a way that does not necessarily maximize the product. For example, consider the case where `x = 123` and `y = 321`. The correct output should be `x = 321` and `y = 123`, which maximizes the product. However, the program will output `x = 321` and `y = 123` only if the digits are already in the correct order. If the digits are not in the correct order, the program will not produce the correct result.

Example:
```
Input:
1
123
321

Output:
321
123
```

The program will output:
```
321
123
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
321
123
```

This example shows that the program does not always maximize the product of `x` and `y` as required by the problem description.
