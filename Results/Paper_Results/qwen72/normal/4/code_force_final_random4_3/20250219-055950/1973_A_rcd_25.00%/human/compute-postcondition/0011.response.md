Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `cur` is `low`, and if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`.**
