The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It checks if the sum of the scores is odd; if so, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even, it further checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`; if true, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value based on a specific condition involving the differences between the scores. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` are unchanged.
