Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `cur` is `low`, and if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`.
Code of the loop:
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, and `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the condition `p_1 - cur > p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` holds.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`, and `cur` is incremented by 1. If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high >= cur` must hold.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`, `cur` is incremented by 1, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues execution.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
