Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).
   - This check is correct and necessary.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If the sum is even, the program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is because the maximum number of draws occurs when the highest scorer (`p3`) has a score that is at least the sum of the other two scores. In this case, all games could have been draws, and the highest scorer could have had all the draws.
   - This check is also correct and necessary.

3. **Complex Case Handling**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program enters a more complex calculation to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` and checks a condition involving the differences between the scores.
   - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to find a valid number of draws. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid number of draws, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when no games were played (all scores are 0) and when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`).

5. **Algorithmic Validity**:
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is based on the constraints of the problem. The program ensures that the total points are even and that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
   - The loop and the condition inside it are designed to find the maximum number of draws that can be distributed among the players while maintaining the given scores.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given test cases, which suggests that the logic is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the problem's constraints and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
