Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, and `high >= cur` must hold.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, with the only change being that the variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The new value of `cur` is `cur + 1`, and the condition `high >= cur` must still hold. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
