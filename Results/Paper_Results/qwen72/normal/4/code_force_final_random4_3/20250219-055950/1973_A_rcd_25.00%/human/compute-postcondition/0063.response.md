Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers within the range [0, 30] and are in non-decreasing order.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be even for the program to reach the `print` statement. If the sum is odd, the program skips the `print` statement and continues to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Sum of `p1` and `p2`:**
   - Since `p1` and `p2` are integers, their sum `p1 + p2` will also be an integer.
   - The value of `p1 + p2` depends on the specific values of `p1` and `p2` provided by the user, but it will always be an integer.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Given that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, the sum of `p1` and `p2` can be any even integer between 0 and 60 (since the maximum value of `p1` and `p2` is 30).

### Final Output:
Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= 30 and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is even)**
