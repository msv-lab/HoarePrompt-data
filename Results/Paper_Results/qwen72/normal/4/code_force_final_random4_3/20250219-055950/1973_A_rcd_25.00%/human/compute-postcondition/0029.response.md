Output State: **The loop will have completed all iterations, and `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` if the loop did not break early. If the loop did break early, `cur` will be the value at which the condition `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` became true. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `_` will remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, the variable `cur` will either be equal to `high + 1` if the loop ran to completion without breaking early, or it will be the value at which the condition `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` became true, causing the loop to break. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `_` will remain the same as they were in the initial state, since they are not modified within the loop.
