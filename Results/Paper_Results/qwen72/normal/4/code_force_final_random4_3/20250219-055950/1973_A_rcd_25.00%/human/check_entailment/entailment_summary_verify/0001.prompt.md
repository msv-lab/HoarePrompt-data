You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It checks if the sum of the scores is odd; if so, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even, it further checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`; if true, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value based on a specific condition involving the differences between the scores. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` are unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The function checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, and a draw contributes 1 point to each player, making the total even).
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Handling the Case Where One Player Has a Score Greater Than or Equal to the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because the maximum number of draws occurs when the two players with the lowest scores have all their points from draws, and the third player has no wins or losses (since `p3` is at least the sum of the other two scores).

4. **Handling the General Case:**
   - The function calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.
   - If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Analysis of the General Case Logic:**
   - The logic in the general case is more complex and needs careful analysis.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is intended to ensure that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the given scores.
   - However, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws in this case seems flawed. Specifically, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` does not necessarily represent the maximum number of draws.

6. **Correctness of the General Case:**
   - The general case logic is not correct. The maximum number of draws should be calculated based on the total points and the distribution of wins and losses.
   - A simpler and more correct approach would be to calculate the total number of games played and then determine the maximum number of draws.

### Correct Approach:
- The total number of points is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
- The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins (since each win contributes 2 points).
- The number of wins can be calculated as `(p3 - p2) + (p2 - p1)`, which simplifies to `p3 - p1`.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = p3 - p1
        max_draws = total_games - max_wins
        if max_draws < 0 or p3 > (p1 + p2 + max_draws):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect in the general case logic for calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
