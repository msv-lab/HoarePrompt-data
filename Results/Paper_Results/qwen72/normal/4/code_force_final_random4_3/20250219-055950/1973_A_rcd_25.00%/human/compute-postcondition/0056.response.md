Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` is equal to `high + 1`. If the loop breaks, `cur` is the value at which the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output is `p3`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `t` is greater than 1 and remains unchanged.
- The variable `_` is 1 and remains unchanged.
- The variables `low` and `high` are determined based on the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and remain unchanged.
- The variable `cur` starts at `low` and is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it either meets the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` or reaches `high + 1`.
- If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output is `p3`.
