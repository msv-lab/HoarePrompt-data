Output: **-1**

Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The initial state provides information about variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output will be exactly `-1` regardless of the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, or `_`.
