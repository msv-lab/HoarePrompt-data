Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is updated to `high + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `cur` is the value at which the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop completes all iterations, the output is `p3`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `t` and `_` also remain unchanged, as they are not used in the loop. The variables `low` and `high` retain their initial values, which are the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively. The variable `cur` is updated to `high + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `cur` is the value at which the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output is `p3`.
