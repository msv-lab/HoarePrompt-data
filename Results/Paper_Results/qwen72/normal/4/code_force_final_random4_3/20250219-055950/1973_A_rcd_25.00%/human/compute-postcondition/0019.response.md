To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `high >= cur`.

### Given State:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`.
- `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`.
- `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`.
- If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
- If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the condition `p_1 - cur > p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` holds.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `high >= cur`.
- At the end of the last iteration, `cur` was incremented by 1.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur` must still be less than or equal to `high`.

### Adjustments:
- The variable `cur` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- To ensure the loop condition `high >= cur` is still true, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `cur` is incremented by 1, the loop can execute one more time if `cur` is still less than or equal to `high`.
- No other adjustments are necessary.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, and `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`. `cur` is incremented by 1, and `high >= cur` must hold.**
