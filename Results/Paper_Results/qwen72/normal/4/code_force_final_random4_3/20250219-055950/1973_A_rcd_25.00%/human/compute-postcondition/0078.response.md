To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `high >= cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`.

Let's break down the current state:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `low` will always be less than or equal to `high`. Therefore, `cur` (which is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`) will be less than or equal to `high + 1` or `high + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be less than or equal to `high`. Given that `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `cur` will be less than or equal to `high` as long as `high` is at least 2 (since `cur` can be `low + 2`).

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` is at least 2 and `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be at least 2, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`**
