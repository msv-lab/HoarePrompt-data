Postcondition: ***`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`, and `cur` is incremented by 1. If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high >= cur` must hold.***
