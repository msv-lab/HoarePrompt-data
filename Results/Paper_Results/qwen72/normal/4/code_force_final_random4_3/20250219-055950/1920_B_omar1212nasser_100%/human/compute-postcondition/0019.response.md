The code snippet `s2 -= elements[-i]` updates the value of `s2` by subtracting the value at the index `-i` of the `elements` list. Given that `i` is 3, `elements[-i]` refers to the third last element of the `elements` list. Therefore, `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-3]`.

Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, the second element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, and the third element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, minus the second last element in `elements`, and minus `elements[-3]`, `i` is 3, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-3]`.**
