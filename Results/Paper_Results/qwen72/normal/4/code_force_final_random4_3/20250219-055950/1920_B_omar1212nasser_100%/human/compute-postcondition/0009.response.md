Postcondition: ***`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `s2` and `i` remain unchanged.***
