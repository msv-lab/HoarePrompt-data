Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is the result of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`. If `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` plus the sum of the `removals` integers starting from `-(negatives + removals)`. Otherwise, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop:
- The list `pos` will contain `removals + 1` elements, where each element is the result of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration.
- The variable `s` will be the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.
- The variable `s2` will be adjusted based on the value of `negatives + removals`:
  - If `negatives + removals` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements` plus the sum of the `removals` integers starting from `-(negatives + removals)`.
  - Otherwise, `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers in `elements`.
