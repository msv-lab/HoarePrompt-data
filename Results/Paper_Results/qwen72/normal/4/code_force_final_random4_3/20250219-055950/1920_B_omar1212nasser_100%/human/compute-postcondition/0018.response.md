Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the third element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, minus the second last element in `elements`, and minus `elements[-3]`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the value of `elements[-3]` from `s`.
- The initial value of `s` was the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` and minus the second last element in `elements`.
- After executing the code, `s` is now the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, minus the second last element in `elements`, and minus `elements[-3]`.
- The values of `elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged.
