The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `removals`. If `removals` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1, and `removals` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`, `i` is 1**
