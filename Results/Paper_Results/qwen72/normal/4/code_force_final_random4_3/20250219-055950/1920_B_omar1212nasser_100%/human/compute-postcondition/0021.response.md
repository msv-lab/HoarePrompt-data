Postcondition: ***`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, the second element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, and the third element is `s - 2 * (s2 - elements[-3])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, minus the second last element in `elements`, and minus `elements[-3]`, `i` is 3. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 3)]`. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.***
