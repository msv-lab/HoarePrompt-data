Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation operations.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**:
     - Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the smallest elements from the array because removing smaller elements has the least impact on the sum.
   - **Bob's Strategy**:
     - Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Bob is to multiply the largest elements by -1 because this will reduce the sum the most.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob have played their optimal moves.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in the sorted list `elements`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements and subtracts twice this sum from `s` to account for Bob's negation.
   - The function iterates over the possible number of removals from 1 to `removals` and adjusts the sum `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `s2` accordingly.
   - It appends each calculated sum to the list `pos` and returns the maximum value from this list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `removals` and `negatives` are both 0 or equal to `n`.
   - It also handles the case where the number of elements to be negated exceeds the remaining elements after removals.

5. **Output**:
   - The output of `func_1` for each test case is the result of `func_2`, which is the maximum possible sum after both players have played optimally.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
