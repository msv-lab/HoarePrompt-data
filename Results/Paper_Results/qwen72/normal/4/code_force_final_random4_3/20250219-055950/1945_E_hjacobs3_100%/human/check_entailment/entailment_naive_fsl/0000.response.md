Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the binary search and the swapping logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not perform the binary search correctly, and the logic for swapping elements to ensure the binary search works is flawed.

### Case where the program fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

### Actual Output:
```
1
2 4
```

### Explanation of the failure:
1. The binary search part of the function `func_1` is incorrect. The initial values of `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n`, respectively, but the problem description specifies `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results.
2. The swapping logic is also incorrect. The function `func_1` only performs one swap, but the problem description allows for up to two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. In the given case, the program only performs one swap, which is insufficient to rearrange the permutation to make the binary search work as expected.

To fix the program, the binary search logic should be adjusted to match the problem description, and the swapping logic should be implemented to ensure that up to two swaps can be performed to make the binary search work correctly.
