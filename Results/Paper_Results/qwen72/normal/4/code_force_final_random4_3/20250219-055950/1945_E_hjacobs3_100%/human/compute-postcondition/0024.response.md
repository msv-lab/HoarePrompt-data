Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `find` is an integer such that \(1 \leq find \leq n\).
   - `n` is the length of `array`.
   - `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` <= `find`.
   - `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`.
   - Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(0)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`.
   - The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `0`.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
