Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` <= `find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `l` and `r` will have the following properties:
- `l` will be the largest index in the array such that the value at `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`.
- `r` will be the smallest index in the array such that the value at `array[r]` is greater than `find`.
- The loop will stop when `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `r` is either `l + 1` or `l` itself.
- The other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
