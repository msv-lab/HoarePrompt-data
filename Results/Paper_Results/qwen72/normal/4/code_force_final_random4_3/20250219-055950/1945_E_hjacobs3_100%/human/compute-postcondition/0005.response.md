Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `n // 2`, `r` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, and the value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

In this output state, the variable `l` has been updated to `n // 2`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
