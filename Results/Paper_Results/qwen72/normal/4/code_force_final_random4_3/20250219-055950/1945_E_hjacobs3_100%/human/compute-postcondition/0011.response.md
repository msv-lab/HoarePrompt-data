Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is now equal to `mid`, `r` is either `n` or `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- The initial values of `array`, `find`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `mid` is still calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, but now `l` has been updated to `mid`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
- The value of `r` is still either `n` or `n // 2`, depending on its initial state.
