Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but now the variable `mid` is assigned the value of `n // 2`, which is the integer division of `n` by 2.
