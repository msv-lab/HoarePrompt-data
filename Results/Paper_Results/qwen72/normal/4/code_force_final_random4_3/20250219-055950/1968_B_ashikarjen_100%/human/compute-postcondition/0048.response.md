Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a string containing two integers separated by a space.
2. `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers.
3. `b` is a new input string.
4. `m` is the length of `b`.
5. `i` is `n - 1`.
6. `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[n-1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists.
7. If `j < m`, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order.
8. If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`, the loop breaks early and `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Parsing:**
   - `a` is a string containing two integers separated by a space. For example, `a = "3 5"`.
   - `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these integers. For example, `n = 3` and `m = 5`.
   - `b` is a new input string. For example, `b = "hello"`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `m` is the length of `b`. For example, `m = 5` (since `b = "hello"`).
   - `i` is `n - 1`. For example, `i = 2` (since `n = 3`).

3. **Finding `j`:**
   - `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[n-1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists.
   - `a[n-1]` is the second integer in the string `a`. For example, `a[n-1] = '5'`.
   - We need to find the smallest index `j` in `b` such that `b[j] == '5'`.
   - If `b` does not contain the character '5', then `j` will be equal to `m`.

4. **Loop and Matching Characters:**
   - If `j < m`, we start a loop to find the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order.
   - If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`, the loop breaks early and `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke.

### Example Scenario:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:
- `a = "3 5"`
- `n = 3`
- `m = 5`
- `b = "hello"`

1. **Finding `j`:**
   - `a[n-1] = '5'`
   - `b` does not contain the character '5', so `j = m = 5`.

2. **Loop and Matching Characters:**
   - Since `j = 5`, the loop breaks early.
   - `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke, which is 0 in this case.

### General Case:
- If `b` contains the character `a[n-1]`, `j` will be the index of the first occurrence of `a[n-1]` in `b`.
- If `b` does not contain the character `a[n-1]`, `j` will be equal to `m`.
- The loop will break early if `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`.
- `k` will be the number of matches found before the loop broke.

### Final Output:
The `print(k)` statement will print the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, or 0 if no such matches are found before the loop breaks.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, or 0 if no such matches are found before the loop breaks)**
