To ensure the `while` loop can execute the first time, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `m` is an integer derived from the input string `a`.
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a string containing two integers separated by a space.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - For the loop to execute, `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space.
- `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `k` is 0.
- `j` is 0.

We need to ensure:
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`.

Since `n` and `m` are derived from the input string `a`, and `n` must be greater than 0, we can assume `m` is also an integer. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to explicitly state that `m` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[0]`.

State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a new input string and `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
