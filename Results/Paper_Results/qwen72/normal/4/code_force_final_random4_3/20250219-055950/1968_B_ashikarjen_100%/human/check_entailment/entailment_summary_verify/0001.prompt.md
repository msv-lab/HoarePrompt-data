You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, followed by two strings `a` and `b`. The function then calculates the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order and prints this number as `k`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings `n` and `m`, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The program initializes two variables: `k` to keep track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to iterate through `b`.
   - It iterates through each character of `a` using a for loop with index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a while loop to find the same character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If the character is found in `b` (i.e., `b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and `b`.
   - If the character is not found in `b` (i.e., `j` reaches `m`), it breaks out of the loop, as the current prefix of `a` cannot be a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `a` is longer than `b` (e.g., the first and sixth test cases).
   - It also handles cases where `a` is a subsequence of `b` (e.g., the fifth test case).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\) in the worst case, but it is optimized to break early when a character in `a` is not found in `b`, which helps in reducing unnecessary iterations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described. It finds the maximum possible length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b` for each test case.
