Output State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing a single element which is a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**

Explanation:
- The code `num2 = int(nums[1])` converts the second element of the list `nums` to an integer and assigns it to `num2`.
- The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of strings representing integers, and `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`.
- The value of `num2` is updated to be the integer value of the second element in `nums`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
