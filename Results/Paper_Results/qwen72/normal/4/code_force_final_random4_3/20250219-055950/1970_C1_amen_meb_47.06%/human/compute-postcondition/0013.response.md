Output State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing a single element which is a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num1 = int(nums[0])` converts the first element of the list `nums` to an integer and assigns it to `num1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
