The function `accept_numbers` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to read input values for `n` and `t` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5), and `t` is the number of rounds (t=1). It should also read `n-1` lines of integers `u` and `v` (1 \leq u, v \leq n) representing the edges of the tree, and one additional line containing an integer `u_1` (1 \leq u_1 \leq n) representing the starting node for the round.
