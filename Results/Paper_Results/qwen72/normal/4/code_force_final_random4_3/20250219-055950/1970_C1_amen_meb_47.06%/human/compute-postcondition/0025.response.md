The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it implicitly reads input from a standard input or similar mechanism. The input consists of the first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`. The next `n-1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree. The last line contains a single integer `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

The function returns a list `numbers` which contains `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree.

Functionality: **The function reads input from a standard input mechanism, consisting of a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, and a starting node `u_1`. It returns a list of `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree.**
