Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input or a similar mechanism. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing `n-1` elements, each element is a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the last valid input line, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the loop.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, expecting a series of lines where each line (except the last) contains two integers representing an edge in a tree. It continues reading until a line does not contain exactly two integers. The function then returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing an edge in the tree. The final state of the program is that the list `numbers` contains `n-1` elements, each element being a list `[num1, num2]` representing an edge in the tree, and the input reading process has concluded.
