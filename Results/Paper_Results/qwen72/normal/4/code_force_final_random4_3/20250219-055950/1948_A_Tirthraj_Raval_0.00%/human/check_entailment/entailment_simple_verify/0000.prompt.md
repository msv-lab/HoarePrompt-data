You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each even `n` input, `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. For each odd `n` input, `n` remains an odd integer and no `pattern` is generated.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 1. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, there should be no suitable string, and the program should print "NO". However, the program only checks if `n` is odd and prints "NO" for odd `n`, but it does not handle the specific case of `n` being 1, which is also an odd number. Therefore, the program will incorrectly print "NO" for `n = 1`, even though it should print "NO" for this case. However, the problem description explicitly states that there is no suitable string for `n = 1`, and the program should print "NO" for this case, which it does. The issue is that the program does not generate a valid string for `n = 2` as it should, and the pattern generation logic is flawed.

For example, when `n = 2`, the program generates the string "AB", but "AB" does not have exactly 2 special characters. The correct output for `n = 2` should be a string like "MM" or "AA", which has exactly 2 special characters.

Let's correct the explanation:

The program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for even `n`. For example, when `n = 2`, the program generates "AB", which does not have any special characters. The correct output should be a string like "MM" or "AA", which has exactly 2 special characters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
