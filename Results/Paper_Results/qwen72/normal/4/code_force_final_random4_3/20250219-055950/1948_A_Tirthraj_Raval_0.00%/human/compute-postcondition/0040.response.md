The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables `t`, `_`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
