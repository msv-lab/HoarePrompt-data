The value of `i` is 1, and the expression `i % 2 ^ 1` evaluates to `1 % 2 ^ 1`, which simplifies to `1 ^ 1`, resulting in `0`. Therefore, `'AB'[0]` is `'A'`. The `pattern` list, which initially contains `['A', 'B', 'B']`, will have `'A'` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than 2, `pattern` is a list containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', `i` is 1**
