#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each even `n` input, `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. For each odd `n` input, `n` remains an odd integer and no `pattern` is generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, the function prints "YES" followed by a string of uppercase Latin letters where each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', repeated `n // 2` times. The length of the generated string is `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.
