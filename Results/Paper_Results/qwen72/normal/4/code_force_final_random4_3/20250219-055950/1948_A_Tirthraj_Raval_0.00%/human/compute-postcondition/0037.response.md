The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is greater than 1. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `_` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 1.

However, since the loop will execute again with `_` being 1, `t` must be greater than 1 to ensure that `_` is still less than `t`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer, and `pattern` is a list of 'B', 'A' pairs repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
