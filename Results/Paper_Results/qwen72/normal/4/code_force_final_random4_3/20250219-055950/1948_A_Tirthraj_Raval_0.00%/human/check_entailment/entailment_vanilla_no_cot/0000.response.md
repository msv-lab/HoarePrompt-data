Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair (either "AA" or "BB"), and an odd number of such pairs cannot be formed.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' and constructs a string of length `n` that meets the criteria. The pattern used is alternating "AB" or "BA" pairs, which ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example:
   - For `n = 2`, the pattern is "AB".
   - For `n = 4`, the pattern is "ABAB".
   - For `n = 6`, the pattern is "ABABAB".

4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern is constructed by appending characters to a list and then joining the list into a string. The use of `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` ensures that the characters alternate correctly.

5. **Output Length**: The constructed string has a length of `n`, which is always within the limit of 200 as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.
