You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each even `n` input, `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. For each odd `n` input, `n` remains an odd integer and no `pattern` is generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, the function prints "YES" followed by a string of uppercase Latin letters where each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', repeated `n // 2` times. The length of the generated string is `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition:**
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be part of a pair (one character equal to exactly one of its neighbors).

3. **Pattern Generation:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then generates a pattern of length `n` using the characters 'A' and 'B' in an alternating manner.
   - The pattern is generated by appending 'A' and 'B' in pairs, ensuring that each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and vice versa. This ensures that each character in the pattern is special.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the generated pattern, which is a string of length `n` with exactly `n` special characters.
   - The length of the string is at most 200, which satisfies the problem's constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Odd `n` Case:**
  - If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters. Each special character must be part of a pair, and an odd number of pairs is not possible.

- **Even `n` Case:**
  - If `n` is even, the program generates a string of length `n` with alternating 'A' and 'B' characters.
  - For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern generated is 'ABABAB'. Each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', making each character special.
  - The pattern generation ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and is of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both the odd and even cases for `n`, and it generates a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
