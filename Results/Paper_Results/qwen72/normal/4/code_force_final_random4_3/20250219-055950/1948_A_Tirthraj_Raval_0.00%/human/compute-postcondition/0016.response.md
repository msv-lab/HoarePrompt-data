The code `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends a new element to the list `pattern`. The element to be appended is determined by the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`.

- `i` is 2.
- `i % 2` is 0 (since 2 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0).
- `0 ^ 1` is 1 (the XOR operation flips the bit from 0 to 1).
- `'AB'[1]` is 'B'.

Therefore, the new element appended to `pattern` is 'B'.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 6, `pattern` is a list containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', `i` is 2.**
