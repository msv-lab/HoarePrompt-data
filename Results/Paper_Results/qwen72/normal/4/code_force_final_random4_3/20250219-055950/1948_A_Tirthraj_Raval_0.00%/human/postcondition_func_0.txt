The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, the function prints "YES" followed by a string of uppercase Latin letters where each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', repeated `n // 2` times. The length of the generated string is `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.
