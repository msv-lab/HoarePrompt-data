### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If `k` is 1, the function prints 1 and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to have a colored cell, the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the function prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. This is because in a grid of size `n x n`, the main diagonals (both primary and secondary) can cover up to `2 * n` diagonals. To cover `k` diagonals, the minimum number of cells to color is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is because after covering the main diagonals, the remaining diagonals need to be covered by additional cells. The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that the minimum number of cells is used to cover the remaining diagonals.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is 1 correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is greater than `2 * n` correctly by ensuring that the additional cells are used efficiently.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct minimum number of cells for each test case based on the logic described above.
