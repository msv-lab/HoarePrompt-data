Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer.
   - If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the current values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(k // 2 + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement will execute only if the program does not skip the iteration due to `k` being 1.
   - If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration, and the `print` statement is not executed.
   - If `k` is not 1, the `print` statement will execute.
   - The value printed is `k // 2 + 1`.

4. **Possible Values of `k`**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `k` can be any integer from 2 to `2 * n`.
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, then `k` is any integer greater than `2 * n`.

5. **Calculation**:
   - For `k` less than or equal to `2 * n`:
     - The expression `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer value.
     - For example, if `k` is 2, then `k // 2 + 1` is `2 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
     - If `k` is 4, then `k // 2 + 1` is `4 // 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For `k` greater than `2 * n`:
     - The expression `k // 2 + 1` will also be an integer value.
     - For example, if `k` is 10 and `n` is 4, then `k // 2 + 1` is `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will output an integer value that is the result of `k // 2 + 1`.
   - The exact value depends on the value of `k` provided by the user input, but it will always be an integer.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer provided by the user input and k is not 1)**
