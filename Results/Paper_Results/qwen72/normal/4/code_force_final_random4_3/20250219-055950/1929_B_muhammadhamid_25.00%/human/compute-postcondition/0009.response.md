Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer.
   - If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Additionally, `k` is greater than 2 * `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k // 2 + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The precondition states that `k` is greater than 2 * `n`.
   - The `print` statement calculates `k // 2 + 1` and prints the result.
   - Since `k` is an integer and `k > 2 * n`, the value of `k // 2` will be the integer division of `k` by 2.
   - Adding 1 to `k // 2` gives the final value to be printed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Given that `k` is greater than 2 * `n`, the value of `k // 2` will be at least `n + 1` (since `k` is greater than 2 * `n`, `k // 2` will be greater than `n`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer greater than 2 * n, and the result is the integer division of k by 2 plus 1)**
