Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Special Case for k == 1**: If `k` is 1, the program prints 1, which is correct because the minimum number of cells needed to color at least one diagonal is 1.

3. **Case for k <= 2 * n**: If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a `n x n` grid, you can color cells in such a way that each cell covers two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `k / 2` rounded up to the nearest integer.

4. **Case for k > 2 * n**: If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because when `k` is greater than `2 * n`, you need to cover more than the main and anti-diagonals. The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that you cover the remaining diagonals by adding one more cell to the minimum required to cover `2 * n` diagonals.

The program handles all the test cases provided in the example correctly, and the logic is sound for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
