Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly. According to the problem description, the maximum number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \). For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program should output the minimum number of cells required to color such that all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the program does not account for this specific case.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 10
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \). The total number of diagonals in a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid is \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \). The program should output the minimum number of cells required to color all 10 diagonals, which is 6. However, the program outputs 5, which is incorrect.

The correct output for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \) should be 6, as shown in the example provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
