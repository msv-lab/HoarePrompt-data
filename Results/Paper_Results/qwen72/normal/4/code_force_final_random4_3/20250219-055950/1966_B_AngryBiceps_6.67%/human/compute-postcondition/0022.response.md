Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `_` is 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` user inputs.
- `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together.
- `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together.
- The length of the set of the first element of `a` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
- The length of the set of `first_row` is 1.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

### Analysis:
1. **`n` and `a`**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` user inputs. Each input is a string.

2. **`first_row` and `last_row`**:
   - `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each string in `a`.
   - `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each string in `a`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The length of the set of the first element of `a` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
     - This means that either the first string in `a` is not a single character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`.
   - The length of the set of `first_row` is 1.
     - This means that all the first characters of the strings in `a` are the same.
   - `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.
     - This means that the string formed by the first characters is different from the string formed by the last characters.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the program will print 'NO' because:
- The first characters of all strings in `a` are the same, but the last characters are different.
- This implies that the structure of the input does not meet some specific criteria, leading to the output 'NO'.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
