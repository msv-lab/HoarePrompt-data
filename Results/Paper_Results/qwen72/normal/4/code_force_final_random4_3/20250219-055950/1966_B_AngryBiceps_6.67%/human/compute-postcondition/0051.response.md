Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is `n-1`.
3. `a` is a list with `n` elements, each element being a user input.
4. `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of each user input.
5. `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of each user input.
6. Either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
7. Additionally, either the length of the set of `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables.
- The conditions provided in the initial state are used to determine whether the program should reach the `print('YES')` statement. However, the statement itself does not depend on these conditions; it will always print 'YES' if it is executed.

### Conditions:
1. **Condition 1:** Either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.
   - This condition ensures that the first element of `a` is either diverse (more than one unique character) or the same as the last element of `a`.

2. **Condition 2:** Additionally, either the length of the set of `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.
   - This condition ensures that either `first_row` is not a string with all identical characters, or `first_row` is the same as `last_row`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('YES')` statement will be executed if the conditions are met.
- Since the conditions are given as part of the initial state, we can assume that they are true when the `print` statement is reached.
- Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES'.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
