The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing two user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of the first user input concatenated with the first character of the second user input, `last_row` is the last character of the first user input concatenated with the last character of the second user input.**
