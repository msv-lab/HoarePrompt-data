Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`; `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains the same as the initial input, and `m` is unchanged. The list `a` now contains `n` strings, each of which was input by the user during the loop. The string `first_row` is composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, concatenated together in the order they were added to `a`. Similarly, the string `last_row` is composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, also concatenated together in the order they were added to `a`. The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
