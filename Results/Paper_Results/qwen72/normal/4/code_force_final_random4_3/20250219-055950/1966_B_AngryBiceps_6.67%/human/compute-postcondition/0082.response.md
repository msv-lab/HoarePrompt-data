The function `func` accepts parameters representing multiple test cases. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and an `n × m` grid represented by a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the grid is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, and an `n × m` grid represented by a list of strings containing 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
