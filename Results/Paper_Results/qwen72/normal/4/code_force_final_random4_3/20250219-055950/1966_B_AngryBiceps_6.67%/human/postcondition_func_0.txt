The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an `n Ã— m` grid represented by a list of strings containing 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row.
2. If the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column.
If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the grid meets the specified conditions.
