The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
