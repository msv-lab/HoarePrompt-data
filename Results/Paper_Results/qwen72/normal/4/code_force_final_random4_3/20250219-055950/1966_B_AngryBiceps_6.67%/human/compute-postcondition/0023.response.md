Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together, and either the length of the set of the first element of `a` is not 1, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. Additionally, either the length of the set of `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
