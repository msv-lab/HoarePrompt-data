The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and starts at 0**
