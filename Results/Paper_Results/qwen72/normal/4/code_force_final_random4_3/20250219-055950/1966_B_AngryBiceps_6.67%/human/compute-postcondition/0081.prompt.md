Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called with the appropriate input as described in the problem statement, which includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and an n × m grid represented by a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together. If the length of the set of the first element in `a` is 1 (meaning the first element is composed of a single unique character) and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list with `n` elements, each element being a user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of each user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of each user input. If the first element of `a` consists of a single unique character and is not equal to the last element of `a`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character, or the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`; `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1 and the first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
