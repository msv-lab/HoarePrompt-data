You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with the appropriate input as described in the problem statement, which includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and an n × m grid represented by a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are integers input by the user for the last test case, and `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings for the last test case. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` for the last test case, and `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` for the last test case. The loop has processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has checked the conditions and printed 'NO' if either the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row, or if the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, and an `n × m` grid represented by a list of strings containing 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
