Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`. If `x` is 0, `results` has a new element 'YES' appended to it, and the program continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, which finds the position in the sorted list `v1` where `l` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
- The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` remain as they were after the previous operations.
- The `results` list is only affected if `x` is 0, in which case 'YES' is appended to it.
- The program continues to the next iteration, but this is not a change in the state of the variables, so it is not included in the output state.
