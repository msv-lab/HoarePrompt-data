Output State: **`mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 3`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = int(data[index])` updates the value of `a[2]` to `int(data[index])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
