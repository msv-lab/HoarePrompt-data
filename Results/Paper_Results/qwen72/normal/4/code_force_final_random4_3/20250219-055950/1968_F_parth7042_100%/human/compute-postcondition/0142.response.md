Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `x == 0`, the appended element is 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the appended element is 'NO'.***
