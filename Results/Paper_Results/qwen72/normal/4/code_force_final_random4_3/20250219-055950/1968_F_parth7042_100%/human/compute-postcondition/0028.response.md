Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `3 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- The list `data` remains unchanged.
- The variable `index` is now `3 + n`, indicating that the loop has processed `n` elements starting from `data[3]`.
- The list `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- The list `results` remains an empty list.
- The variable `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- The list `a` is now populated with integers, where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`.
- The list `pf` is now populated with integers, where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`.
- The defaultdict `mp` now contains keys corresponding to the values in `pf`, and each key maps to a list of indices where the corresponding `pf` value was encountered.
- The variable `i` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
