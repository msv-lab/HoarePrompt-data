Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, and `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains the list `[1]`, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[2]` is the result of `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains the list `[1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains the list `[2]`, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 6, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be at least 3, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `a[3]` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf[2]` is the result of `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, and `pf[3]` is the result of `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains the list `[1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains the list `[2]`, `mp[pf[3]]` now contains the list `[3]`, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
