Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is assigned the result of `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`.** 

The value of `pf[1]` is now the result of the XOR operation between `pf[0]` and `a[1]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
