Output State: **`index` is increased by `2 * q + n + 3`, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and must be at least 1, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[index + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1, `r` is equal to `q`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, which finds the index of the first element in the list `v1` (which is `mp[pf[r]]`) that is not less than the value of `l`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the `bisect_left` function call.
