Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the flow of the loop by causing the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid.
