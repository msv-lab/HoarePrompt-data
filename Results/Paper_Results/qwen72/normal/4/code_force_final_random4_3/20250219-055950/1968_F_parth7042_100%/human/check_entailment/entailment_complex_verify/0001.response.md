### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for handling large inputs efficiently.
   - The index variable is used to track the current position in the input list, which is incremented as elements are read.
   - The initial call to `func_1()` is incorrect and should be inside a main block or directly called after defining the function. However, this does not affect the correctness of the logic within `func_1`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n + 1`.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding segments with the same XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can be split into segments where each segment's XOR is `0`, making the subarray interesting. In this case, the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices `v1[it1]` and `v2[it2]` such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` and both indices are within the bounds of the subarray. This check is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the positions of the indices.
   - The logic for checking if there are valid indices in the lists stored in `mp` is correct. Specifically, `it1` and `it2` are used to find the positions in the lists where the prefix XOR values match the subarray bounds.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.
   - The output format is correct, with each result on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated and stored. This allows for efficient XOR calculations for any subarray.
  - The dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices of each prefix XOR value, which is useful for checking the existence of valid segments.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the XOR of the subarray is `0`, which is a sufficient condition for the subarray to be interesting.
  - For the case where the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are valid indices in the lists stored in `mp` that can form the required segments. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the positions of the indices.
  - The conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` ensure that the indices are within the bounds of the lists.
  - The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that the segments are non-overlapping and valid.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by checking the conditions on the indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The prefix XOR array and the dictionary `mp` are constructed in linear time, and each query is processed in logarithmic time using binary search.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The only issue is the initial call to `func_1()`, which should be corrected to ensure the program runs as intended. However, this does not affect the correctness of the logic within `func_1`.

Final: **True**
