Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x` is 0, `results` has a new element 'YES' appended to it, and the program continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code snippet `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` assigns the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` to `it2`. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the potential addition of 'YES' to `results` if `x` is 0. The updated state reflects the new value of `it2` and retains all other initial conditions.
