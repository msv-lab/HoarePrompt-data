Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be at least 3, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `a[3]` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `pf[1]` is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[2]` is the result of `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains the list `[1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains the list `[2]`, `i` is 3**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[5]` to `a[3]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `data[0]`, `data[1]`, `data[2]`, `data[3]`, `data[4]`, and `data[5]` are not provided, but the relationships and constraints remain as described in the initial state.
