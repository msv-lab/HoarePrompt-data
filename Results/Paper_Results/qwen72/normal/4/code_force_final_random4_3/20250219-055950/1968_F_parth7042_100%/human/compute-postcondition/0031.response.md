The code snippet `r = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `r`. Given the initial state, we know that `index` is `3 + n`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0. Therefore, `index + 1` is `3 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `4 + n`. This means `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[4 + n]`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `3 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`.**
