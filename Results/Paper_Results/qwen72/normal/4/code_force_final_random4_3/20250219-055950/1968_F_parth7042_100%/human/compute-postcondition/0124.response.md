Output State: **`q` is greater than 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2 + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` now contains the string 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is now `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operation.
- The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `results` remain as they were in the initial state, but `x` has been updated.
