Output State: **The values of `index`, `mp`, `results`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

Natural Language Explanation:
The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. As a result, none of the variables mentioned in the initial state are modified by this code snippet. The program simply proceeds to the next step in the loop or the next statement outside the loop, depending on the context. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
