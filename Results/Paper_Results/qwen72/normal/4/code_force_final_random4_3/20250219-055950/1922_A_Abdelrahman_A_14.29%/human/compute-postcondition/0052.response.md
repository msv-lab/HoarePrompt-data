To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t`: An integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n`: An integer where 1 <= n <= 20.
   - `a`: An input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `b`: An input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `c`: A new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `tests`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `i`: An integer set to 1.
   - `slength`: An input integer.
   - `x`: The third character in `c`.
   - `no`: A boolean variable that is initially True.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` (the third character in `c`) is not in `a` and not in `b`, `no` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `no` remains True.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains `print('YES')`.

Given the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, or `no`. The conditions provided do not affect the print statement directly, as the print statement is not conditional and will execute unconditionally.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
