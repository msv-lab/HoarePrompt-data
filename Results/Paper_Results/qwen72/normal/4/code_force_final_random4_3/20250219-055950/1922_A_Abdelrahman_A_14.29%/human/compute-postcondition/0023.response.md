To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
   - `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `c` is an input string of length `n` (where \(n \geq 3\)) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
   - `tests` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `slength` is an input integer.
   - `x` is the third character of `c`.
   - If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
