Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is False if any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`, otherwise `no` remains True.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `tests`, `i`, and `slength` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `no` will be set to `False` if any character in the string `c` is not found in either `a` or `b`. If all characters in `c` are found in either `a` or `b`, `no` will remain `True`.
