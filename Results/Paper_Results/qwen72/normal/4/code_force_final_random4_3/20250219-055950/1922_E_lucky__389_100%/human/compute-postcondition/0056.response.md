Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the increasing subsequences that sum up to the original `X`, and `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not 0.
- In each iteration, the loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` and subtracts it from `x`. This value (the exponent minus 1) is appended to `subseq_lens`.
- The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value appended to `subseq_lens`.
- The loop terminates when `x` becomes 0, meaning all the required subsequences have been accounted for.
- After the loop finishes, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the lengths of the increasing subsequences, and `mx` will be the maximum length among these subsequences.
