Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list of integers.
   - `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`.
   - `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` followed by the elements `subseq_lens[1]` through `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ansv` must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Understanding `ansv`:**
   - `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - Then, it adds the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element (`subseq_lens[1]`) to the last element (`subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`).

3. **Determine the value of `ansv[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is 2, we need to find the third element in the `ansv` list.
   - The first part of `ansv` is a sequence of integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - Therefore, the third element in `ansv` will be 2, assuming `mx` is at least 3 (since `ansv` must have at least 2 elements and the sequence starts from 0).

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will print the third element of `ansv` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the construction of `ansv`, the output will be:

Output: **2 ** (where 2 is the third element of the `ansv` list)
