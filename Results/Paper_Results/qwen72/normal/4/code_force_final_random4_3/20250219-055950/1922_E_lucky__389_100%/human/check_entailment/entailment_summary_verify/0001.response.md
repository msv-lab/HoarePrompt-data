### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to construct an array of integers with a length of at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` reads the integer \( X \) and initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of subsequences.
   - It also initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of subsequences found.
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints 1 and 0, which is correct because the array \([0]\) has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: \([0]\) and the empty subsequence.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into powers of 2:
     - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and appends the corresponding length to `subseq_lens`.
     - It subtracts this power of 2 from \( X \) and updates `mx` if necessary.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the lengths of the subsequences found.
   - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Function `func_1` Summary:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where \( X \) is 2.
   - The loop decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2, which is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the lengths of the subsequences, which ensures that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`, which is the correct format for the output.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is 2.
   - The loop decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2, which is a valid approach for constructing an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the lengths of the subsequences, ensuring that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`, which is the correct format for the output.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but the decomposition into powers of 2 should not result in an array longer than 200 for the given range of \( X \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where \( X \) is a large number up to \( 10^{18} \). The decomposition into powers of 2 is efficient and should handle such large numbers.
   - The program should ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200. Given the constraints and the nature of the decomposition, the length of the array will not exceed 200.
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) cannot be decomposed into a valid array, but the problem guarantees \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so this case should not occur.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1, but the problem guarantees \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so this is not an issue.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but the decomposition into powers of 2 should not result in an array longer than 200 for the given range of \( X \).

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. It correctly decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array accordingly, ensuring that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and meets all the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
