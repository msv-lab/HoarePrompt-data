The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `x` must be such that `2 ** 2 <= x`, which means `x` must be at least 4.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 4. `i` is 2**
