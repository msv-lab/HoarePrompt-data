Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly for the number of test cases. The problem description specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the program always reads 10 lines of input, regardless of the value of `t`. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will read more lines than necessary, and if `t` is greater than 10, the program will not read all the test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```

The program will still read 10 lines, leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
