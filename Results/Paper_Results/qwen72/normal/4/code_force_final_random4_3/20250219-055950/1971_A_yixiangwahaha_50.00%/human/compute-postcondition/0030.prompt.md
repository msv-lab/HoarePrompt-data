Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all 10 iterations, `i` is 9, the loop will have iterated 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes 10 integer values, each value being the first element of the `xylist` from each iteration, and `y` is a list that now includes 10 integer values, each value being the second element of the `xylist` from each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list. If `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list. If `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list. If `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
