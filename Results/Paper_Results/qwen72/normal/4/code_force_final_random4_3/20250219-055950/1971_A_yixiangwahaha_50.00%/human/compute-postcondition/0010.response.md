Output State: **`i` is 1, the loop will iterate 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of the new `xylist` twice, `y` is a list that now includes the integer value of the second element of the new `xylist` three times.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The loop will still iterate 10 times.
- `xylist` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string on spaces.
- `x` remains a list that includes the integer value of the first element of the new `xylist` twice.
- `y` is updated by appending the integer value of the second element of `xylist` again, so it now includes this value three times.
