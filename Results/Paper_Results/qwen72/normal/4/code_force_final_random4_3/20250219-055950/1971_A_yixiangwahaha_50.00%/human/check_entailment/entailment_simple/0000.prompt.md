Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are integers provided as input, with 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 10 iterations, `i` is 9, the loop will have iterated 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes 10 integer values, each value being the first element of the `xylist` from each iteration, and `y` is a list that now includes 10 integer values, each value being the second element of the `xylist` from each iteration.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `i` is 9, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers. For each iteration, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true, and the output is `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false, and the output is `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.
