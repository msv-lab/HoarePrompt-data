Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list. If `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.*** 

This postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition and applies them to both the if and else parts, as no changes are made to the variables in either part.
