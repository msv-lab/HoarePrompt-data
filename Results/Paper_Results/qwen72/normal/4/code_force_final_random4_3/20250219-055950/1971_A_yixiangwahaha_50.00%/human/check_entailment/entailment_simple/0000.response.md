Reasoning:  
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description. Here are the key points:

1. **Input Handling for `t`:** The variable `t` is supposed to represent the number of test cases, and the loop should iterate `t` times, not a fixed 10 times. The program uses `range(10)` which will always iterate 10 times, regardless of the value of `t`.

2. **Type Conversion for `t`:** The value of `t` is read as a string from `input()`, but it should be converted to an integer using `int()` before being used in the loop.

3. **Correct Loop Iteration:** The loop that reads the test cases should iterate `t` times, not 10 times. This can be fixed by changing `range(10)` to `range(int(t))`.

4. **Output Formatting:** The program uses `' '` to separate the integers in the output, which is unnecessary. The `print` function automatically adds a space between arguments, so `print(x[i], y[i])` is sufficient.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Convert t to an integer
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(t):  # Iterate t times
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    
    for i in range(t):  # Iterate t times
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], x[i])
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
