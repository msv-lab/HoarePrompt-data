The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameter `10`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The loop will iterate 10 times, so `10` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, the loop will iterate 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, `y` is a list that now includes the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.**
