To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces.
   - `x` is an empty list.
   - `y` is an empty list.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true.
   - Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false.

Given that `x` and `y` are both empty lists, accessing `x[0]` or `y[0]` will raise an `IndexError` because there are no elements in these lists. Therefore, the conditions provided are not valid and cannot be evaluated.

Since the lists `x` and `y` are empty, attempting to access `x[i]` or `y[i]` (where `i` is 2) will also raise an `IndexError`.

Thus, the `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])` statement will result in an error and will not print anything.

Output: **IndexError (since `x` and `y` are empty lists, accessing `x[2]` and `y[2]` raises an IndexError)**
