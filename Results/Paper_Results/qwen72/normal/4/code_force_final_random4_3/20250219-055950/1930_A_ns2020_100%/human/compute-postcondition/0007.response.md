The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 4999. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 4999, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order**
