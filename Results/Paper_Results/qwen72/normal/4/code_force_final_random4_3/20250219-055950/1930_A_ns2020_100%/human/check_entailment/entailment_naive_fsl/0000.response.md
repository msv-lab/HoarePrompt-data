Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading and Sorting the Array**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`.
3. **Calculating the Score**: The program calculates the maximum score by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A`. This is correct because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the even indices when pairs are formed. By summing these elements, the program ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- **Single Test Case**: The program works for a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- **Small and Large Values of n**: The program works for both small and large values of `n` within the given constraints.
- **Various Integer Values**: The program correctly handles various integer values within the given constraints.

Since the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
