To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 4999.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `A` is a list of integers in ascending order.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - `A[::2]` is a slice of the list `A` that selects every second element starting from the first element (index 0). This means it will select elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `A` is a list of integers in ascending order, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) are part of the list.
   - The `sum(A[::2])` will add up all the elements at these even indices.
   - The exact numerical value of the sum depends on the specific values in the list `A`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output will be the sum of the elements at even indices in the list `A`.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the list A (where A is a list of integers in ascending order)**
