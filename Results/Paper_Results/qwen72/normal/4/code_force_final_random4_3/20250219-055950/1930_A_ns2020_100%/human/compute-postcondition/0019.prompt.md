Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, the function should take two parameters: `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function should return a list of integers representing the maximum final score for each test case.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A.sort()
    print(sum(A[::2]))
    t = t - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 4999, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 4998, `n` is the input integer, `A` is a list of integers in ascending order.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 4997, `n` is the input integer, `A` is a list of integers in ascending order.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
