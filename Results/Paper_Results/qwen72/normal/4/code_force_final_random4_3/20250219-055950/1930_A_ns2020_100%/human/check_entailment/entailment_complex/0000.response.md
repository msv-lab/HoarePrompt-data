Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and a list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and then sums up the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing). This approach is correct because, after sorting, the minimum value in each pair of consecutive elements will always be the one at the even index. By summing these minimum values, the program effectively calculates the maximum possible score according to the problem's rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading `n` and the List `A`**: For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is necessary to maximize the sum of the minimum values.
4. **Summing Elements at Even Indices**: After sorting, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the minimum values of each pair. Summing these values gives the maximum possible score.
5. **Output**: The program prints the sum for each test case, which is the correct output format.

The program does not return any value, but it prints the results directly, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
