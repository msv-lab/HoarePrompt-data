Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It sorts the list and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the state of `n` and `A` is undefined as they are reinitialized for each test case. **
