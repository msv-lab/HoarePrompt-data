Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, the function should take two parameters: `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function should return a list of integers representing the maximum final score for each test case.**
