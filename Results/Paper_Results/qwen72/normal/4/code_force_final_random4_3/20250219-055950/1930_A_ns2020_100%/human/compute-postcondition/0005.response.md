Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000. This variable is not directly used in the code snippet.
   - `n` is an input integer. This variable is not directly used in the code snippet.
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `A[::2]` is a slicing operation that selects every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0). This means it will select elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.
   - The `print` statement will output this sum.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the elements selected by `A[::2]` will be the elements at even indices.
   - The sum of these elements will be printed.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the sum of the elements at even indices in the list `A`.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the list `A` (where `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order)**
