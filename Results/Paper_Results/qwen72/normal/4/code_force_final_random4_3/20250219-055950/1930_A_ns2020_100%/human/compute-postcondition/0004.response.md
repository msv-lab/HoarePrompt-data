The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.**
