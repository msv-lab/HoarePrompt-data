The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop uses `range(t)`, and a new iteration is about to start, `t` must be decremented by 1 to reflect the progress of the loop. The variable `_` is not used and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
