Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is equal to `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`.** 

The list `M` is now sorted in ascending order, while the values of `t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
