#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is 0, all test cases have been processed, and the total cost for each test case has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, with a daily ticket purchase limit of `m`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the total cost for each test case has been printed, and the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
