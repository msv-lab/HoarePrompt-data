To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input.
   - `n` is the length of `N`.
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is equal to `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - If `n * m` is equal to `k`:
     - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m` is not equal to `k`:
     - `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The value of `cost` depends on whether `n * m` is equal to `k` or not.
   - Since the exact values of `L`, `M`, and `n` are not provided, we need to describe the output in terms of these variables and the given conditions.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print(cost)` statement will output the calculated cost based on the provided logic. Here is the precise description:

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated as follows:**
- **If `n * m` is equal to `k`:**
  - `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- **If `n * m` is not equal to `k`:**
  - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted list `M`.
  - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
  - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`.
  - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. **)**
