The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (n, m, k, a) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
