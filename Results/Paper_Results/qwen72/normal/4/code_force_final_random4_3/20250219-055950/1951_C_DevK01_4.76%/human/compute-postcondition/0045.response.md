Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is updated to the ceiling of `k / m`.
- The values of `L`, `t`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The ceiling function ensures that `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.
