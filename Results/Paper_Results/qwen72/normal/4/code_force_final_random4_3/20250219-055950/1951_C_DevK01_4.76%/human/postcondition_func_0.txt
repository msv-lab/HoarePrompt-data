The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, with a daily ticket purchase limit of `m`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the total cost for each test case has been printed, and the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
