### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Adjusting `m` to be the Minimum of `m` and `k`:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the number of tickets that can be bought in a single day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting the Ticket Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list `M` to ensure that the cheapest tickets are considered first. This is a crucial step for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given the constraint of buying at most `m` tickets per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to get the cheapest days to buy tickets.

6. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` cheapest days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase for each subsequent day.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the program adjusts the cost calculation:
     - It pops the last element `w` from `N` and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` that need to be bought on the last day.
     - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` for the last day, plus the cost for the remaining days `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Analysis of the Cost Calculation:
- The cost calculation for the case `n * m == k` is correct. It buys `m` tickets on each of the `q` cheapest days and accounts for the price increase.
- The cost calculation for the case `n * m != k` is more complex. The program correctly identifies the last day and the remaining tickets to be bought, but the additional cost calculation seems incorrect. Specifically, the term `n * m * mu` is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect result.

### Correctness:
- The program is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the cost calculation for the case `n * m != k`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)
        
        print(cost)
        
    # State: `t` is 0, all test cases have been processed, and the total cost for each test case has been printed.

func()
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: False** due to the incorrect additional cost calculation in the case `n * m != k`. The term `n * m * mu` should be removed.

### Explanation:
- The term `n * m * mu` in the cost calculation for the case `n * m != k` is incorrect because it adds an unnecessary cost. The correct calculation should only include the cost of buying the remaining tickets on the last day and the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the previous days, plus the price increase for those days.
