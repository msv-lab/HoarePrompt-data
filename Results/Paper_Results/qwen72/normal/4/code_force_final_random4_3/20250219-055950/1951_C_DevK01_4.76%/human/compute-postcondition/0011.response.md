Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `n * m` is equal to `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the elements in `N`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the second term in the cost calculation, which is `m` squared times the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers.
- The value of `cost` is the result of the above expression.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
