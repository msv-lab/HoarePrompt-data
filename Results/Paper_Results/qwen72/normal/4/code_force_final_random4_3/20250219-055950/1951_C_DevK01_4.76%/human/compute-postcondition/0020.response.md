The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are directly modified by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The loop or conditional structure that this `continue` statement is part of is not specified, so we can only state that the program will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The program will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in.**
