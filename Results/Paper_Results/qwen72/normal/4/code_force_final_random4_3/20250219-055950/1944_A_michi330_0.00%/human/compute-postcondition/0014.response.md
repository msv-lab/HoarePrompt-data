Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided. The initial state conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the user input, and they replace the previous input values. If the new `k` is greater than or equal to the new `n - 1`, the program retains these new values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, it retains the same values but they are the updated ones from the input.
