The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer `1`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **1**
