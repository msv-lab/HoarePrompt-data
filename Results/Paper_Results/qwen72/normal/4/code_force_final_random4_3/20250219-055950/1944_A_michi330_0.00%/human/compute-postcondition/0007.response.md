Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.***
