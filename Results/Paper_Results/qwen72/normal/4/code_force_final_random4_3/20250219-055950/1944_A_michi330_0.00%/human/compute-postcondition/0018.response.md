Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`, `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the function also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- The variable `i` is now equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variables `n` and `k` are input integers that are read during each iteration of the loop.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are retained after each iteration, regardless of the condition inside the loop.
