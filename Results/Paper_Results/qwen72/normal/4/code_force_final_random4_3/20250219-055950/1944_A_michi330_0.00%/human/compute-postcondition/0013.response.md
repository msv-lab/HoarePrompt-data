The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `t` must still be greater than `i` (so `t` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, the program also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.**
