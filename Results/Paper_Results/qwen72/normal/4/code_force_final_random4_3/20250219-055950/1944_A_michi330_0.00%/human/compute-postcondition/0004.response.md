The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

Let's analyze the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because they are not used within it.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **1**
