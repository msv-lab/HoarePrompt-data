The `print(n - 1)` statement will print the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer provided to the program.

Based on the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is another input integer, and it is given that `k` is less than `n - 1`.

Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `n` is not specified, but we know that `n - 1` is a well-defined integer that is one less than `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the input integer)**
