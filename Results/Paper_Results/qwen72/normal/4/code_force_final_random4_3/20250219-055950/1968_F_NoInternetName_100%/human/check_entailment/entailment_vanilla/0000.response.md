### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1(cast)` is used to parse input lines and cast them to the specified type (int in this case).
   - The main function `func_5` reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of elements in the array) and `q` (the number of queries).

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The array `a` is read, and a prefix XOR array `x` is constructed. The prefix XOR array helps in efficiently calculating the XOR of any subarray.
   - `inds` is a dictionary that maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs in the prefix XOR array. This is useful for quickly finding the positions of the same XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero. If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray is zero, and the subarray is interesting.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is not zero, the function uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split point, and the subarray is interesting. Otherwise, it is not interesting.

4. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are binary search functions that find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_4` is a modified version of `func_2` that returns the index + 1 if a valid index is found, otherwise it returns `None`.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly constructed.
   - The binary search functions are used to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary.
   - The conditions for determining if a subarray is interesting are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient and accurate results for each query.

**Correctness: True**
