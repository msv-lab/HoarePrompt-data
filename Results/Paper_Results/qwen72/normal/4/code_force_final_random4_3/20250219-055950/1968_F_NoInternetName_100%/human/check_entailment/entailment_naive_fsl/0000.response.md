Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases for determining if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the logic for checking if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values is flawed. The program uses a binary search approach to find indices, but this approach does not guarantee that the subarray can be split into the required parts with equal XOR values.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

The program should output:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

However, the program's logic for checking the subarray from index 1 to 3 (i.e., subarray [1, 1, 2]) will incorrectly output "Yes" because it does not properly handle the case where the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR values. The correct output for this subarray should be "No" since it cannot be split into parts with equal XOR values.
