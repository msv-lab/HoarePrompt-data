Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `q` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The values of `l` and `r` are now the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, and they must satisfy the condition 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.
