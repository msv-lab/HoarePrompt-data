Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
2. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
4. `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
5. `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
6. `q` is greater than 0.
7. `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` or 0 if no such index exists.
8. `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of this context directly affects the `print` statement, which is a fixed string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **No**
