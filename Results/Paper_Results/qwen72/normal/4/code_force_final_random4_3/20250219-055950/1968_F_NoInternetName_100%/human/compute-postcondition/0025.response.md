Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` or 0 if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is greater than `lower`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
