Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `q`**: These values remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` is iterated over, and its length and element constraints remain the same.
- **`l` and `r`**: These values are also unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: Initially, `x` contains only the integer 0. After the loop completes, `x` will contain the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index. Specifically, `x[0]` is 0, `x[1]` is `a[0]`, `x[2]` is `a[0] ^ a[1]`, `x[3]` is `a[0] ^ a[1] ^ a[2]`, and so on, up to `x[n]` which is the XOR of all elements in `a`.
- **`inds`**: This is a defaultdict of lists. For each element in `x`, `inds` will map the element to a list of indices where it appears in `x`. For example, if `a = [3, 1, 2, 3]`, then `x` will be `[0, 3, 2, 0, 3]` and `inds` will be `{0: [0, 2, 4], 3: [1, 3], 2: [2]}`.
