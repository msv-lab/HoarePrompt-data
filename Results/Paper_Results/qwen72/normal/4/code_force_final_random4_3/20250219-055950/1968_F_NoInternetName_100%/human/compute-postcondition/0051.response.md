Functionality: ** The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of integers and a series of queries `q`. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR up to index `r`. If they are equal, or if there exists a subsequence within the specified range that satisfies certain conditions, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the cumulative XOR list `x` and the index dictionary `inds` are populated based on the elements of `a`. The function has processed all `q` queries. **
