Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 2 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, and `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2, `i` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index `len(x) - 1` (which is 2) to the list `inds[x[-1]]`.
- `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, which is `1 ^ a[1]`.
- Therefore, `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` now contains the integers 1 and 2.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
