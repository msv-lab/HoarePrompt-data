Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is greater than the new value of `i`, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`**

Explanation:
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The values of `n` and `q` remain the same as they were returned by `func_1(int)` in the initial state.
- The list `a` and the list `x` remain unchanged.
- The defaultdict `inds` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition that `q` is greater than the new value of `i` is still valid.
