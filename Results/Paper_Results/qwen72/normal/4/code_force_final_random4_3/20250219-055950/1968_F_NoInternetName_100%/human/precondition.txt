cast is a function that can be used to convert input strings to the appropriate data types. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an array of integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30) and a series of queries (l, r) where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the number of elements n and the number of queries q are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
