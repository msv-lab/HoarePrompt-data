The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `i`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` that must have at least 2 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[i]` now contains the integer 1, `i` is the second element of `a`**
