Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is greater than the new value of `i`, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0, `upper` is the first index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.**
