Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `q` is greater than 0, `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` or 0 if no such index exists. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.***
