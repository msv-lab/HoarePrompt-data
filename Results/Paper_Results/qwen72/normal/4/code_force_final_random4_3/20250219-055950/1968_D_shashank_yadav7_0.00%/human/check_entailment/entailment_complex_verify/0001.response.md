### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions in the array `a`. This is correct.

4. **Score Calculation Loop:**
   - The program iterates `n` times to simulate the game turns, but this is incorrect. The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times.
   - The loop also incorrectly updates `k` by decrementing it within the loop, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect behavior if `k` is greater than `n`.

5. **Score Update Logic:**
   - The program uses the following lines to update the scores:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     These lines are incorrect and do not follow the rules of the game. The correct way to update the scores is simply to add the value at the current position in the array `a` to the current score.

6. **Final Score Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly. This part is correct, but it is based on incorrect score updates.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Score Calculation:**
  - `bodya_score` and `sasha_score` are initialized with the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.
- **Score Update Loop:**
  - The loop runs `k-1` times (since the initial score is already added).
  - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated according to the permutation `p`.
  - The scores are updated by adding the value at the new position in the array `a`.
- **Final Score Comparison:**
  - After the loop, the scores are compared, and the result is printed.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the score update loop and the number of iterations.
- The corrected program follows the rules of the game correctly and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is provided above.)
