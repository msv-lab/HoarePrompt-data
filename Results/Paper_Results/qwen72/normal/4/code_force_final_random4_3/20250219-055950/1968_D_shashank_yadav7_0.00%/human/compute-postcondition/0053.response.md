Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are updated based on the input provided.
- `n` is now an input integer.
- `k` is now an input integer.
- `b` is now an input integer.
- `s` is now an input integer.
- The initial state of `t`, `i`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remains unchanged.
- The condition `bm > sm` is still evaluated based on the new values of `b` and `s`.
