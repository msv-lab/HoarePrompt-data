The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1` (or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0), and `t` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now `n`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `-(n - 1)` (or 0 if the loop breaks), `b` is the value after `n - 1` iterations of `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `n - 1` iterations of `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial `sp` plus `a[s]` added `n - 1` times, `bp` is the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
