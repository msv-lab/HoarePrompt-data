Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
