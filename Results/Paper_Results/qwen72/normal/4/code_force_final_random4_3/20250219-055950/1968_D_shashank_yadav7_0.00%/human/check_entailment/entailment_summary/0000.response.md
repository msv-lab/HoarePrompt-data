Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to simulate the "Permutation game" described in the problem statement. However, there are some issues with the logic and the way the scores are calculated, which can lead to incorrect results. Here are the key points:

1. **Initialization of Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as they start at positions `P_B` and `P_S`.

2. **Loop for Game Turns**:
   - The loop iterates `k` times, which is correct for the number of turns in the game.
   - However, the way the scores are updated is incorrect. The program uses a complex formula involving `max` and `k`, which does not correctly simulate the game's rules. According to the game rules, on each turn, a player either stays at the current position or moves to `p_x`, and the score is updated by adding `a_x` to the current score.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The correct way to calculate the score for each player is to simply add `a[x]` to the current score for each turn, where `x` is the current position of the player.
   - The program incorrectly updates `bm` and `sm` using a formula that does not reflect the game's rules. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     are not correct. The scores should be updated as:
     ```python
     bm += a[b]
     sm += a[s]
     ```

4. **Position Updates**:
   - The positions are updated correctly using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`, but the `- 1` is unnecessary because the positions are already 0-indexed after the initial adjustment.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - The final comparison of `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner is correct.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The score updates are incorrect, which can lead to wrong results.

Correctness: **False**
