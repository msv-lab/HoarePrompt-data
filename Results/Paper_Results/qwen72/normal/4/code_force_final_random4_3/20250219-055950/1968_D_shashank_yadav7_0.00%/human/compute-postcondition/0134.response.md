The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`**
