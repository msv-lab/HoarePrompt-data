Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic of the game as described. Specifically, the way the scores are calculated and the way the positions are updated is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the scores by adding the maximum of the current score and a calculated value, which does not follow the problem description. Additionally, the program does not correctly simulate the game for the full `k` turns. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect output because of the flawed score calculation and position update logic. The program does not correctly simulate the game for the full `k` turns, and the score updates are not as described in the problem statement.

The correct implementation should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, updating the positions and scores according to the rules provided in the problem description.
