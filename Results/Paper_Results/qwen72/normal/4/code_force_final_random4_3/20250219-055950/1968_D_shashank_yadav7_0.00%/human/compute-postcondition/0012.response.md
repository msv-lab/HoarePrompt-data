Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k - 1)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is the original input integer minus 1.
- The values of `bm` and `sm` are recalculated using the new value of `k` (which is now `k - 1`).
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged.
