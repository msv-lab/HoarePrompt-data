The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`**
