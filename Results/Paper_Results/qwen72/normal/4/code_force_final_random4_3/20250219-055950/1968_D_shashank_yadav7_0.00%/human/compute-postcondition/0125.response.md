Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k - 1) + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k - 1) + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`**

Explanation:
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k - 1) + bp`.
- `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k - 1) + sp`.
- `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`.
- `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
