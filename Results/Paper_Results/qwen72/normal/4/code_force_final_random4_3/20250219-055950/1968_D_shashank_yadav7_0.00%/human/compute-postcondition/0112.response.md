Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is greater than `sm` if `a[b] * k` was greater than `a[s] * k` before, otherwise `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is updated to `a[s] * k`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The condition `bm` is greater than `sm` if `a[b] * k` was greater than `a[s] * k` before, otherwise `bm` is less than or equal to `sm` is still valid.
