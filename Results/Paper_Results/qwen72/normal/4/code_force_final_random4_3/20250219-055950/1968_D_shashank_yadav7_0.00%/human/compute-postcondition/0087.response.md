Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if k is 0` is not met, so the loop or if statement is not exited.
