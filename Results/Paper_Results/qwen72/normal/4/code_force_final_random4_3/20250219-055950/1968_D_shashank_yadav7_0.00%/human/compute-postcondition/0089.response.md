Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * -3 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is updated by adding `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` to its current value. Since `k` is -3, this becomes `max(bm, a[b] * -3 + bp)`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The updated value of `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * -3 + bp)`.
- The updated value of `sm` is `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`.
- The updated value of `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`.
- The updated value of `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`.
