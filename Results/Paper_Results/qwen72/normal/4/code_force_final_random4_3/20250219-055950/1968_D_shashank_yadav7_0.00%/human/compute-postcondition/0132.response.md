Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`. If `k` was 0 before the if statement, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
