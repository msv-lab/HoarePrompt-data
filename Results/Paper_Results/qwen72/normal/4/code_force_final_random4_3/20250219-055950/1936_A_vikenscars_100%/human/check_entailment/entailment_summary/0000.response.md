### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for sending a query to the interactor and receiving the response. It correctly formats the query and prints it, then reads the response from the input.
   - The function ensures that the query is flushed to the standard output, which is necessary for the interactor to receive it.
   - The response is returned as a string, which can be one of "<", ">", or "=".

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i \oplus p_j` is maximized.
   - The function starts by finding the index `max_item_idx` of the maximum element in the permutation `p` using the bitwise OR operation. This is done by comparing `p_max_item_idx \mid p_max_item_idx` with `p_i \mid p_i` for all `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`. If `p_i \mid p_i` is greater, `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - Next, the function finds the index `pair_idx` of the element that, when XORed with `p_max_item_idx`, gives the maximum result. This is done by comparing `p_max_item_idx \mid p_pair_idx` with `p_max_item_idx \mid p_i` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `p_max_item_idx \mid p_i` is greater, `pair_idx` is updated to `i`. If they are equal, a secondary comparison is made to ensure the correct index is chosen.
   - Finally, the function prints the result in the format `! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}`.

3. **Query Count**:
   - The function `func_2` makes at most `2n - 1` queries. The first loop makes `n - 1` queries to find `max_item_idx`, and the second loop makes `n` queries to find `pair_idx`.
   - Since `2n - 1` is less than `3n`, the function does not exceed the query limit.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation using the bitwise OR operation.
   - The algorithm then correctly identifies the pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation.
   - The logic ensures that the maximum XOR value is found by comparing the results of the bitwise OR operations and updating the indices accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program meets the problem description and constraints. It correctly finds a pair of indices that maximize the XOR value using at most `3n` queries.

Correctness: **True**
