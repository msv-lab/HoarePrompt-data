Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 3, 3)`, `max_item_idx` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to the result of the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `3`, and `3`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `max_item_idx`) remain unchanged.
