Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is 2, `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 2, 2)` if `ans` is '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` is 2 and `ans` is not '<'.** 

The value of `max_item_idx` is updated to 2, while the other variables remain unchanged. If `ans` is '<', `max_item_idx` is now 2 and `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 2, 2)`. If `ans` is not '<', `max_item_idx` is also 2, but `ans` remains as it was.
