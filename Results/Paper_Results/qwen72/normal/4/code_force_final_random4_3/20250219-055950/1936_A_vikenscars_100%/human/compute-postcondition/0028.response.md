To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The other variables (`max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop `for i in range(n)` increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0.
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is '<', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. If `ans2` is greater than the current value of `pair_idx`, `pair_idx` is set to 0. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains unchanged. If `ans1` is not equal to '<' or '=', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `n` remains the same, and the loop will execute if `1 < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0. `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is '<', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. If `ans2` is greater than the current value of `pair_idx`, `pair_idx` is set to 0. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains unchanged. If `ans1` is not equal to '<' or '=', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`.**
