### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.

2. **Strategy:**
   - The program uses a two-step approach:
     1. **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
        - The first loop in `func_2` iterates through all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
        - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
        - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
        - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the index with the maximum value in the permutation.
     2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
        - The second loop iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
        - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\).
        - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
        - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is equal, it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

3. **Query Analysis:**
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \(2n - 1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum value in the permutation. This is because \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\) for any \(i\), and the loop updates `max_item_idx` to the index of the maximum value.
   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
     - The second loop is intended to find the index that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the maximum result. However, the logic here is flawed. The comparison \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) does not directly help in finding the maximum XOR. The bitwise OR operation does not provide information about the XOR result.
     - The additional comparison \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) is also not useful for finding the maximum XOR, as it only compares the values themselves, not their XOR results.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(n = 2\) correctly, as it will find the only possible pair \((0, 1)\) or \((1, 0)\).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically incorrect in its approach to finding the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. The second loop's logic does not ensure that the pair \((\text{max_item_idx}, \text{pair_idx})\) is one of the pairs with the maximum XOR value. The bitwise OR comparisons do not provide the necessary information to determine the maximum XOR.

Final: **False**
