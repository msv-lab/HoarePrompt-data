### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.

2. **Strategy:**
   - The program uses a two-step approach:
     1. **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
        - The first loop in `func_2` iterates through all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
        - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
        - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
        - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the index with the maximum value in the permutation.
     2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
        - The second loop iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
        - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\).
        - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
        - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is equal, it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

3. **Query Analysis:**
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \(2n - 1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **First Loop:**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum value in the permutation. This is because \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\) for any \(i\), and the loop updates `max_item_idx` to the index of the maximum value.
   - **Second Loop:**
     - The second loop aims to find the index `pair_idx` such that \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \oplus p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) is maximized.
     - The loop compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is equal, it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.
     - However, this approach does not guarantee that the final pair \((\text{max_item_idx}, \text{pair_idx})\) will have the maximum XOR value. The bitwise OR operation does not directly correlate with the XOR operation in a way that ensures the maximum XOR is found.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the permutation \(p = [0, 3, 1, 2]\).
     - The first loop will set `max_item_idx` to 1 (since \(p_1 = 3\) is the maximum value).
     - The second loop will compare \(p_1 \mid p_1\) with \(p_1 \mid p_i\) for \(i = 0, 1, 2, 3\).
     - For \(i = 0\), \(p_1 \mid p_0 = 3 \mid 0 = 3\), which is equal to \(p_1 \mid p_1 = 3\).
     - For \(i = 1\), \(p_1 \mid p_1 = 3 \mid 3 = 3\), which is equal to \(p_1 \mid p_1 = 3\).
     - For \(i = 2\), \(p_1 \mid p_2 = 3 \mid 1 = 3\), which is equal to \(p_1 \mid p_1 = 3\).
     - For \(i = 3\), \(p_1 \mid p_3 = 3 \mid 2 = 3\), which is equal to \(p_1 \mid p_1 = 3\).
     - The loop will not update `pair_idx` because all comparisons are equal.
     - The final pair \((1, 1)\) will be printed, which is incorrect since \(p_1 \oplus p_1 = 0\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value in all cases.
   - The approach of using bitwise OR to find the maximum XOR is flawed.
