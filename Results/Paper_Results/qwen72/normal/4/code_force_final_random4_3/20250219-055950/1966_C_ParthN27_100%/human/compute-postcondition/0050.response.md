Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` contains all integers from `arr`, `ans` is 1.**

**Natural Language Description:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged and must be at least 1. The variable `n` is still a positive integer representing the user input. The variable `i` is now equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`. The list `arr` remains the same as it was provided by the user. The set `s` now contains all the integers from the list `arr`. The variable `ans` is still 1, as the loop only adds elements to the set `s` and does not modify `ans`.
