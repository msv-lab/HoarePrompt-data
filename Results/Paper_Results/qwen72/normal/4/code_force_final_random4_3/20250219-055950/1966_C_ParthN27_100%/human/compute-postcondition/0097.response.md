Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning.
   - `ans` is 1.
   - `n` is equal to 2.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - Since `n` is given as 2, the length of `s` is 2.
   - `i` is `n-1`, so `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning. Given that `n` is 2, `s` must have exactly 2 elements: `[0, unique_element]`, where `unique_element` is the only unique element from `arr` (since `s` must have exactly 2 elements and one of them is 0).
   - `ans` is 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

4. **Execution:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string 'Alice'.
   - The values of the variables and objects do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **Alice**
