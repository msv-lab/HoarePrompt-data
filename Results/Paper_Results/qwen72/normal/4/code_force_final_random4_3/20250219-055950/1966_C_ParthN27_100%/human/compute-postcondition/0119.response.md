Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning. If `n` is equal to 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if the loop completed without breaking, `ans` is 1. If the loop broke, `ans` is 0.***
