Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning. If the difference between the first element of `s` (which is `s[1]`) and the zeroth element of `s` (which is `s[0]` and is 0) is greater than 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.***
