### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Set and Sorting**:
   - The function converts the list of stone counts `arr` into a set `s` to remove duplicates.
   - It then converts the set back into a list and sorts it.
   - The function adds a `0` at the beginning of the sorted list to handle the initial state where no stones have been removed.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The function checks if the length of the sorted list `s` is 2. If it is, it means all piles have the same number of stones, and Alice can win by removing all stones in one move.
   - If the length of `s` is more than 2, the function iterates through the sorted list to check if the differences between consecutive elements are at most 1.
   - If at any point the difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks, and the function determines the winner based on the value of `ans`.
   - The variable `ans` is toggled using the XOR operation `ans ^= 1` for each consecutive pair of elements in the list. This is used to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of unique stone counts.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints "Alice" if `ans` is 1, indicating that Alice wins.
   - It prints "Bob" if `ans` is 0, indicating that Bob wins.

### Analysis of the Winning Condition:
- **Unique and Consecutive Differences**:
  - If the stone counts are all unique and the differences between consecutive stone counts are at most 1, the game can be reduced to a sequence where each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile. This means the game will end when the number of stones in each pile is reduced to 0, and the player who makes the last move wins.
  - The XOR operation `ans ^= 1` is used to toggle the winner based on the parity of the number of unique stone counts. If the number of unique stone counts is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `3 3 3 3 3`
  - All piles have the same number of stones (3). Alice can remove all stones in one move, so she wins.
- **Test Case 2**: `1 7`
  - The stone counts are `1` and `7`. Alice must remove 1 stone, leaving Bob with `0 6`. Bob can then remove 6 stones, leaving Alice with no move, so Bob wins.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 3 9 7 4 2 100`
  - The unique stone counts are `1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 100`. The differences are not all 1, so the function correctly determines that Alice wins.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 2 3`
  - The unique stone counts are `1, 2, 3`. The differences are all 1, so the function correctly determines that Alice wins.
- **Test Case 5**: `2 1 3 4 2 4`
  - The unique stone counts are `1, 2, 3, 4`. The differences are all 1, so the function correctly determines that Bob wins.
- **Test Case 6**: `5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2`
  - The unique stone counts are `2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9`. The differences are not all 1, so the function correctly determines that Alice wins.
- **Test Case 7**: `1000000000`
  - There is only one pile with 1000000000 stones. Alice can remove all stones in one move, so she wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description and the execution summary. The logic for handling unique stone counts and their differences is sound and matches the expected behavior for the game.
