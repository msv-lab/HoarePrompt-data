The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state provides information about variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended.
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The string `'Bob'` is a literal and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **Bob**
