Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.** 

The value of `ans` has been updated to 0 by performing the XOR operation with 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
