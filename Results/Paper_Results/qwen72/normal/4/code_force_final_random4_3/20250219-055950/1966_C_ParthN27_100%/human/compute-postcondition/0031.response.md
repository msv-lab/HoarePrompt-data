The code `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1, and assigns the result back to `ans`. This operation will flip the value of `ans` from 1 to 0, or from 0 to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop
- `n` is now equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning
- If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and the loop or if statement has been broken. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1

The value of `ans` is flipped by the XOR operation. If `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. If `ans` was 0, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
