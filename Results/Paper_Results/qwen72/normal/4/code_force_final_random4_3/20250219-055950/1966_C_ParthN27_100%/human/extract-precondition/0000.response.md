Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input from the standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
