Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended.
   - `ans` is 1, indicating that there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **Alice**
