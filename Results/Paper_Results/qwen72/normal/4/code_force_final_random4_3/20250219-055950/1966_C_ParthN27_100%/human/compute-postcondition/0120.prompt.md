Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input from the standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is 2, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2 and the difference between all pairs of consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` is at most 1, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` indicates whether there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`: if `ans` is 1, there are differences; if `ans` is 0, there are no differences.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning. If `n` is equal to 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if the loop completed without breaking, `ans` is 1. If the loop broke, `ans` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
