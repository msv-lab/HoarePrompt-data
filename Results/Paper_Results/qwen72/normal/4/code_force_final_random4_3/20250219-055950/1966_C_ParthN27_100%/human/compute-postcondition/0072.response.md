Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, and `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous condition check. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to 1 or 0 depending on its previous value.***
