The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1, and `n` must still be a positive integer greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` contains the first integer from `arr`, `ans` is 1**
