The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` if `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, it returns -1.
