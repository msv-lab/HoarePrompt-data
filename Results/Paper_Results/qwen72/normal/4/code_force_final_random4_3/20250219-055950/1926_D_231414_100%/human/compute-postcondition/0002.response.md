The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `check` and the list of lists containing non-negative integers are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
