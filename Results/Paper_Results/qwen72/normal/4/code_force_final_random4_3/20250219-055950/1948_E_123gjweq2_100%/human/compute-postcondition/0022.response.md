Output State: **`i` is 2, `not_mid` is greater than 2, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `right - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` sets the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Since this is the same as the initial state, no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
