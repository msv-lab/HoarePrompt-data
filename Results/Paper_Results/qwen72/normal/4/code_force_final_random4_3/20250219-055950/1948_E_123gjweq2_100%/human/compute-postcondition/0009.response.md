The code snippet `cliquess[left + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + i`. Given that `i` is 1, the index `left + i` is `left + 1`. The value of `clique` is a positive integer, and this assignment does not change the value of `clique` itself. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 1), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 2`.**
