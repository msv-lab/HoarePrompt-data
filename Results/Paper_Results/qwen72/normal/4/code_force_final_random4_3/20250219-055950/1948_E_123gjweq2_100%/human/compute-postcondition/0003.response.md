Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `not_mid` is assigned the value `(right - left + 1) - mid`.
- Given `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` simplifies to `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`.
- The states of the other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`) remain unchanged.
