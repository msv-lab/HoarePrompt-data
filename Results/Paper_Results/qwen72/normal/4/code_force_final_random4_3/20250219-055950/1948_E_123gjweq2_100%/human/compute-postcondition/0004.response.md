The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`
- `clique` is a positive integer
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`

To ensure the loop executes, `mid` must be greater than 0. This means `(right - left) // 2` must be greater than 0, which implies that `right - left` must be at least 1 (i.e., `right` must be greater than `left`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 0**
