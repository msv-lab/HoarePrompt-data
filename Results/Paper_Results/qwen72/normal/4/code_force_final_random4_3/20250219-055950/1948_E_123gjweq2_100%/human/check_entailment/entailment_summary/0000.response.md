### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - An edge is added between vertices `i` and `j` if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to print the assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - Calculates the number of cliques as \( \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil \).
     - Initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of length `n` with zeros.
     - Calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate indices and the clique number.
     - Prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and `cliquess`.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - Fills the segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with a specific pattern.
     - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
     - The second half of the segment is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
     - Sets the corresponding segment in `cliquess` to the value of `clique`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Assignment of Integers**:
     - The function `make_array` ensures that the integers assigned to the vertices are distinct and range from 1 to `n`.
     - The pattern of filling `arr` ensures that each integer from 1 to `n` is used exactly once.

   - **Clique Formation**:
     - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as \( \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil \), which is a reasonable approach to minimize the number of cliques.
     - The function `make_array` ensures that vertices within each segment (clique) are connected according to the given condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

   - **Output Format**:
     - The function `func_1` prints the required output in the correct format:
       - The first line contains the assignment of integers to vertices.
       - The second line contains the number of cliques.
       - The third line contains the partition of the graph into cliques.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values.
   - For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program correctly outputs a single clique with both vertices assigned distinct integers.

5. **Overall Behavior**:
   - The program correctly assigns integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
