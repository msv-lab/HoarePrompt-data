To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `not_mid`. The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `mid - 1` before the loop starts. However, in the loop head, `i` is used as the loop variable, so it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. **`not_mid`**: The variable `not_mid` is defined as `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`. For the loop to execute, `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`.
- `i` is `mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively.
- `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `i` must be 0.
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

Let's verify the conditions:
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`.
- Since `left` < `right`, `right - left` is a positive integer.
- Therefore, `(right - left + 1)` is a positive integer greater than `(right - left) // 2`, ensuring `not_mid` is greater than 0.

So, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, and `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`.**
