The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + mid + i`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `not_mid` is greater than 1 (not directly relevant to the code snippet)
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`
- `clique` is a positive integer
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively
- `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`

The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` does not change the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` because it is already set to `clique` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `not_mid` is greater than 1, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**
