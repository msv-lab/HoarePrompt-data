Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 1), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`.
- Given `i` is 1, `small_element` is `left + 1`, and `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, the expression `left + mid - i - 1` simplifies to `left + mid - 2`.
- The value assigned to `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + i`, which is `left + 1 + 1` or `left + 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
