    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n, `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each segment of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter) is filled with the corresponding `i + 1` value, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros, and the function `make_array` has been called `cliques` times with arguments `i * k`, `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, and `i + 1` for each `i` from 0 to `cliques - 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive). It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function then populates an array `arr` of length `n` such that each segment of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter) is filled with the corresponding `i + 1` value, where `i` ranges from 0 to `cliques - 1`. The function prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that: 
- The elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` are filled with values in a specific pattern. The first half of this range (from `left + mid - 1` to `left`) is filled with values starting from `left + 1` and incrementing by 1, while the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) is filled with values starting from `right + 1` and decrementing by 1.
- The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. 
The function does not return any value.
