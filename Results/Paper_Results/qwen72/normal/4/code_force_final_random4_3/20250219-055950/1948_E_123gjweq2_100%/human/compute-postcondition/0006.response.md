Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**

The code snippet `cliquess[left + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + i`. Given that `i` is 0, the element at index `left` in the list `cliquess` is now equal to `clique`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
