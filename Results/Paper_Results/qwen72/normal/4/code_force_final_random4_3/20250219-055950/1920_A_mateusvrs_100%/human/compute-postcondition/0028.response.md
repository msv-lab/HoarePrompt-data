The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0 and will still be decremented by 1, `_` remains a placeholder, and `a` and `x` are still integers provided by the user input. The specific value of `ax` after the update depends on the values of `x` and `ax`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the original `ax`.**
