Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1 if the second element in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. If `tmp` was initially 1 (because the second element in `cx` is between `bx` and `ax`), it becomes 2. If `tmp` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
