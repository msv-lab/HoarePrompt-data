Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads each constraint, which is a pair of integers `(a, x)`.

2. **Constraint Types**:
   - **Type 1 (a == 1)**: The program correctly updates the maximum lower bound `bx` for `k` using `max(x, bx)`.
   - **Type 2 (a == 2)**: The program correctly updates the minimum upper bound `ax` for `k` using `min(x, ax)`.
   - **Type 3 (a == 3)**: The program correctly adds the value `x` to a set `cx` to keep track of values that `k` cannot be.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - The program checks if the maximum lower bound `bx` is greater than the minimum upper bound `ax`. If this is the case, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating that no valid `k` exists.
   - If the range is valid, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` using `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line, using `print(*r, sep='\n')`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the range is invalid (i.e., `bx > ax`) by returning `0`.
   - The program also handles the case where there are no type 3 constraints by correctly calculating the range without any exclusions.

7. **Initial Values**:
   - The initial values for `ax` and `bx` are set to `1000000000 + 7` and `-1` respectively, which are outside the valid range of `x` (1 to 10^9). This ensures that the initial bounds are updated correctly by the first type 1 and type 2 constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
