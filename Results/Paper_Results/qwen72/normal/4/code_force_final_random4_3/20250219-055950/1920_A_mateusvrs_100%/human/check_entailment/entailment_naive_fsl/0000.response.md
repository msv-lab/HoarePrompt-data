Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints as described in the problem statement. It initializes the minimum upper bound (`ax`) and the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and updates them based on the constraints. It also keeps track of the values that `k` must not be equal to (`cx`). After processing all constraints, it checks if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, in which case it appends `0` to the result list, indicating no valid `k` exists. If valid `k` values do exist, it calculates the number of such values by subtracting the count of invalid values within the range from the total range size. This approach seems to cover all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description.
