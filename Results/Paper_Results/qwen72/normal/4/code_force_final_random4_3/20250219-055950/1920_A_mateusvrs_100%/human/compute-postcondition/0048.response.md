The code snippet `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **`r`**: The list `r` is modified by appending the value of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
2. **`ax - bx + 1 - tmp`**: This expression calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx`, adds 1, and then subtracts `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 0
- `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted)
- `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1
- `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2
- `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2
- `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`
- `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`

The expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) minus the count of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. This value is then appended to the list `r`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list with one additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
