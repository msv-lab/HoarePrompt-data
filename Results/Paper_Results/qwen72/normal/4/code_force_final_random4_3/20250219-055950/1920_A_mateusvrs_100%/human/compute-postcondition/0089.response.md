The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element of `cx`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element of `cx`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, `cx` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
