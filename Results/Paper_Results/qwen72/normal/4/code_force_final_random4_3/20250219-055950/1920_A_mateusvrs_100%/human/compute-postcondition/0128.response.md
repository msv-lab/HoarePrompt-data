Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` == 1, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 1. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 2. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx` for all `a` values not equal to 1 or 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0, as it was in the initial state.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so after all `n` iterations, `_` will be `n-1`.
- The loop processes `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)` provided as input.
- If `a` is 1, the variable `bx` will be updated to the maximum value of `x` encountered during the loop where `a` was 1.
- If `a` is 2, the variable `ax` will be updated to the minimum value of `x` encountered during the loop where `a` was 2.
- For any other value of `a` (not 1 or 2), the value of `x` will be added to the set `cx`.
- The set `cx` will contain all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was not 1 or 2.
