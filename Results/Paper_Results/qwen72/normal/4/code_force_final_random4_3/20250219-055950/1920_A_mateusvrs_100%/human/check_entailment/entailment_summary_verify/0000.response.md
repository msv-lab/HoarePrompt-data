### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the minimum upper bound.
   - It initializes `bx` to a very small value (`-1`) to represent the maximum lower bound.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Updating Bounds:**
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current value and `x` if the constraint type is 1 (i.e., `k >= x`).
   - It updates `ax` to the minimum of the current value and `x` if the constraint type is 2 (i.e., `k <= x`).
   - It adds `x` to the set `cx` if the constraint type is 3 (i.e., `k != x`).

4. **Range Validation:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating no valid `k` exists.
   - If the range is valid, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by:
     - Counting the number of invalid values within the range `[bx, ax]` that are in the set `cx`.
     - Subtracting this count from the total number of integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of Bound Updates:**
  - The function correctly updates the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`) based on the constraints.
  - The use of a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to is appropriate and ensures that each value is counted only once.

- **Range Validation:**
  - The check `if bx > ax` is correct and ensures that the function returns `0` for invalid ranges, which aligns with the problem statement.

- **Counting Valid `k` Values:**
  - The function correctly calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of invalid values within this range.
  - The logic for counting invalid values within the range is implemented correctly using a loop and the set `cx`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It initializes the bounds appropriately, updates them based on the constraints, validates the range, and counts the valid `k` values accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
