Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the scenarios as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded special case for when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns `0`. This is not a general solution and will fail for other test cases that do not match this specific condition.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Moves**: The logic for Bob's moves is flawed. Bob should aim to minimize the sum by flipping the smallest elements (or the largest negative elements if any). However, the program incorrectly tries to flip the largest elements, which might not always be optimal.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Alice's Moves**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The program does not correctly handle this. It subtracts elements from the end of the sorted list, which are the largest elements, not the smallest.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation and the way Bob's flips are handled in the loop are incorrect. The program should consider the optimal way to flip the smallest elements to minimize the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest k elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Calculate the initial sum after Alice's removal
    s = sum(elements)
    
    # Bob flips the smallest x elements to minimize the sum
    elements.sort()
    for i in range(negatives):
        if elements[i] > 0:
            break
        elements[i] = -elements[i]
    
    # Calculate the final sum after Bob's flips
    final_sum = sum(elements)
    
    return final_sum

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Alice removes the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum.
- Bob flips the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum.
- The final sum is calculated correctly after both players have made their optimal moves.
