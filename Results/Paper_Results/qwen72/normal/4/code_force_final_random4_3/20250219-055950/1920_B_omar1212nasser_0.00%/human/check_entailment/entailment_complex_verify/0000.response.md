Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue in the `func_2` function, which is the hard-coded return statement `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This condition is not a general solution and will indeed fail for other inputs where the optimal strategy might not result in a sum of 0. The provided counterexample clearly demonstrates this:

For the input:
```
1
6 6 3
1 2 3 4 5 100
```

The expected output is `-100`, but the actual output is `0` due to the hard-coded condition. This is incorrect because Alice can remove the elements `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, and Bob can then multiply `100` by `-1`, resulting in a sum of `-100`.

The hard-coded condition is a specific case and does not account for the general behavior of the game. The correct approach should involve dynamically calculating the optimal sum based on the values of `removals` and `negatives` for each test case.

Additionally, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. The function attempts to calculate the sum after Alice's removals and Bob's negations, but it does not handle the cases where the number of negations and removals interact in a way that affects the final sum. For example, if Alice removes the smallest elements, Bob should focus on negating the largest remaining elements to minimize the sum. The current logic does not correctly handle this interaction.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
