The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The constraints are that `0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements)` and `1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5` with each element in the list being in the range `1 <= elements[i] <= 1000`.

**Case_1:** If certain conditions are met, the function returns `0`.

**Case_2:** The function returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains the values of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration, including the final value. Here, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the elements from `-(negatives + removals)` to `-(removals + 1)` if `negatives + removals` does not exceed the length of `elements`; otherwise, `n` is `0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns `0` in certain conditions. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value of `s - 2 * n` from a list `pos`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the elements from `-(negatives + removals)` to `-(removals + 1)` if `negatives + removals` is within the bounds of the list length; otherwise, `n` is `0`.**
