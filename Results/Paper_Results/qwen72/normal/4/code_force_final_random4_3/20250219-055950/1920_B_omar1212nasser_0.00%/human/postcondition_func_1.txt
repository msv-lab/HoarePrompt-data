The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns `0` if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. Otherwise, it calculates a series of values based on the sum of the elements in `elements` and the sum of the last `removals` and `negatives` elements, and returns the maximum value from this series. The final state of the program is that `elements` remains unchanged, and the function returns either `0` or the maximum value of `s - 2 * n` from the list `pos`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the elements from `-(negatives + removals)` to `-(removals + 1)` if `negatives + removals` is within the bounds of the list length; otherwise, `n` is `0`.
