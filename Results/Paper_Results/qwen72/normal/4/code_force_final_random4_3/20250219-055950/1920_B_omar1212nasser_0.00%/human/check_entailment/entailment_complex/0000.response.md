Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` and calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function takes three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`.
   - It has a special case where if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This special case is not explained in the problem statement and seems to be an ad-hoc condition that may not be generally applicable.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in `elements` and `n` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `removals` and updates `s` by subtracting the `i`-th largest element (since the list is sorted in ascending order, `elements[-i]` is the `i`-th largest element).
   - It updates `n` by adding the `i`-th largest element from the remaining list and subtracting the `i`-th largest element from the current `n`.
   - If `negatives + removals` exceeds the length of `elements`, it sets `n` to 0.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos` after each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the sum.
   - Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he should multiply the largest elements by -1 to reduce the sum as much as possible.
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements this strategy by sorting the list and considering the removals and negations in a way that aligns with the optimal play for both players.

4. **Special Case**:
   - The special case where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3 is not justified by the problem statement. This could lead to incorrect results for specific inputs that match this condition but should not return 0 based on the game rules.

Given the above reasoning, the special case in `func_2` makes the program incorrect for some inputs.

Correctness: **False**
