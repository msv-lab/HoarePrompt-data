### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - **Case 1**: `b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit is calculated as `n * a`.
   - **Case 2**: `b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   - **Case 3**: `b - a < n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `k = b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The formula used is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`, but this is incorrect. The correct formula should be `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program is **incorrect** because the formula used in the third case is wrong. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1)) / 2 + a * (n - k)))
```
