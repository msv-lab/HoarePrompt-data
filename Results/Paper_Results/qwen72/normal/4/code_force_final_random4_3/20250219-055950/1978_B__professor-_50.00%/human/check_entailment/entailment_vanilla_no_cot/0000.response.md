Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum profit when `b - a < n` is incorrect. The program should calculate the profit for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining buns sold at the usual price. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit_modified = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))
            profit_usual = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_modified + profit_usual)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price. The profit is `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b > a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is greater than the usual price `a`, we need to determine the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.
   - The optimal `k` is `min(n, b)` because we can only sell up to `b` buns at the modified price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is `a * (n - k)`.

### Corrected Calculation:
- **Profit from the first `k` buns**: This is the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time. The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
  \]
- **Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns**: This is simply `a * (n - k)`.

### Final Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit_modified = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            profit_usual = a * (n - k)
            print(profit_modified + profit_usual)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program should handle all the cases correctly and produce the expected output.
