To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds true.
- If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds true.
- Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### Formula to Evaluate:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `b - a`**:
   - If `b <= a`, then `b - a` is a non-positive integer.
   - If `b > a`, then `b - a` is a positive integer.

2. **Evaluate the condition `b - a >= n`**:
   - If `b - a >= n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`.
   - If `b - a < n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

3. **Calculate the expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `(b - a) / 2` is the half of the difference between `b` and `a`.
     - `(b - a + 1)` is the difference between `b` and `a` plus one.
     - `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` is the product of these two values.
     - `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`.
     - The final value is the sum of these two products, converted to an integer using `int()`.

### Cases:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
   - `b - a` is non-positive, so `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` will be zero or a negative value.
   - The expression simplifies to `int(0 + a * n) = int(a * n)`.
   - Output: **a * n (where a and n are the input integers)**

2. **Case 2: `b > a` and `b - a < n`**:
   - `b - a` is positive but less than `n`.
   - The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` will be a positive value.
   - The final value is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
   - Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where a, b, and n are the input integers)**

3. **Case 3: `b > a` and `b - a >= n`**:
   - `b - a` is positive and at least `n`.
   - The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` will be a positive value.
   - The final value is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
   - Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where a, b, and n are the input integers)**

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, the output of the `print` statement will depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. However, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where a, b, and n are the input integers)**

This output covers all possible cases based on the given conditions.
