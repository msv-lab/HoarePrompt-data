Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified operation (pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). The key insight is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container is an integer. This average value is the target amount of water each container should have to be equalized.

The program works as follows:
1. **Sum Calculation and Divisibility Check**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'No' immediately. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
2. **Target Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
3. **Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative balance (`container`). For each container, it updates the balance by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it returns 'No' because it means that the current container cannot be filled to the target amount without violating the operation constraint (pouring from a lower-index container to a higher-index container).
4. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without the balance becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

The logic of the program is sound. The balance check ensures that the water can be redistributed without violating the operation constraint. If the balance never goes negative, it means that the water can be poured in such a way that all containers eventually reach the target amount.

However, there is a critical issue in the input handling:
- The program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case, which is incorrect. The input format specifies multiple test cases, and the program should handle each test case separately.

To fix this, the program should be modified to read and process each test case individually. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

# Correct input handling
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

Given the original program's input handling issue, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**

The logic for determining if the water can be equalized is correct, but the input handling is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior for multiple test cases.
