Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `2 * (water - target) + (water - target)`, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `water` is the third element of `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, `container` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- `container` is updated by adding `water - target` to its current value.
- The new value of `container` is `2 * (water - target) + (water - target)`, which simplifies to `3 * (water - target)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
