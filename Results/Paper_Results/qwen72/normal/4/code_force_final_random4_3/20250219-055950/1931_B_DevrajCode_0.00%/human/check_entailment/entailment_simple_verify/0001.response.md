### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The original program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is indeed incorrect because it assumes that the input is a single line of space-separated integers, which is not the case. The input is structured with multiple test cases, each having its own `n` and `a`.
   - The corrected program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case separately, ensuring that the input is correctly parsed and the function `func_1` is called for each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is unnecessary.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.

3. **Container Balance Check:**
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and maintains a cumulative balance `container`.
   - For each container, it updates the balance by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the balance becomes negative, it returns 'No'. This is because a negative balance indicates that more water has been poured out than has been poured in, which is not possible with the given operation constraints (i.e., pouring from a container with a higher index to a lower index).

4. **Output:**
   - The original program prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the first test case only, which is incorrect because it should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem.
   - The corrected program correctly processes and prints the result for each test case.

### Evaluation:
- The original program's logic for handling a single test case is correct. However, it fails to handle multiple test cases correctly due to the input parsing issue.
- The corrected program addresses the input parsing issue and correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Final:
**False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The logic for a single test case is correct, but the overall program structure is flawed. The corrected program, as provided, is the correct implementation.
