The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `n` and `l` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**
