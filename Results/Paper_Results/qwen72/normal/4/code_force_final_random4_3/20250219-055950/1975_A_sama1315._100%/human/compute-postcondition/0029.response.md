The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), `n` (a positive integer between 2 and 50), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
