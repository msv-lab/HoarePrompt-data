Output State: **`t` is now 0, `n` is the last integer value of `data` that was used to determine the length of the list `a` in the final iteration, `a` is the last list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data`, `idx` is now `2 + t_initial*n_final` where `t_initial` is the initial value of `t` and `n_final` is the number of integers processed in the final iteration, `results` is a list containing `t_initial` elements, each element being the value returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The value of `n` is the last integer used in the loop to determine the length of the list `a`.
- The list `a` contains the last set of `n` integers that were processed in the final iteration of the loop.
- The index `idx` is now `2 + t_initial * n_final`, where `t_initial` is the initial value of `t` and `n_final` is the number of integers processed in the final iteration. This reflects the total number of elements processed from the `data` list.
- The list `results` contains `t_initial` elements, with each element being the result of `func_1(a)` from each iteration of the loop.
