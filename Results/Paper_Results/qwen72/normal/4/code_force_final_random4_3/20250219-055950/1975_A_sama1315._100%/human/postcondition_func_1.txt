The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` integers into a list `a`. It then calls `func_1` with the list `a` for each test case and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n` is the last integer used to determine the length of the list `a` in the final iteration, `a` is the last list of `n` integers, `idx` is the index after processing all integers, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.
