Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`, `idx` is now `3 + 2*n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `3 + n` and ending at `3 + 2*n - 1`, `results` contains the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`, where `idx` is `3 + 2*n`.
- `idx` remains `3 + 2*n` as it was not changed by the code.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `3 + n` and ending at `3 + 2*n - 1`.
- `results` still contains the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the value of `result`.
- `result` is still the value returned by `func_1(a)`.
