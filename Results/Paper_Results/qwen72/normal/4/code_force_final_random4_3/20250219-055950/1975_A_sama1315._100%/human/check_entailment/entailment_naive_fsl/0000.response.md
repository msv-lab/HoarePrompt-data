Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them). Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function checks if any contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array `a`) is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the specified operation.
   - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
- If an array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
- The function checks all possible contiguous subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
