The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, but this does not ensure that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
