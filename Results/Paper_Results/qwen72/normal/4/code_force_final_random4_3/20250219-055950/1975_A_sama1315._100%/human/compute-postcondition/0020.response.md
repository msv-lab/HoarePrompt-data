The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is not explicitly tracked but is incremented implicitly by the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, and `_` will be incremented to the next value in the range.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is now `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `3 + n` and ending at `3 + 2*n - 1`, `t` is now `t - 1`**
