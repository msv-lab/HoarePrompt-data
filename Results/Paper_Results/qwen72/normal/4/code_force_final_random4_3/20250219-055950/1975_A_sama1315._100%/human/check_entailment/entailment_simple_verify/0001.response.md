### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping these parts.
   - The key insight is that if there exists a point in the array where the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array, then the array can be sorted using the operation.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To check if such a point exists, we can concatenate the array with itself and look for a subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) that matches the sorted version of the array.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be sorted by the described operation.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness:** The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible splits of the array. If any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that the array can be sorted by the described operation.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness:** The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results. It prints the results in the required format.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The state before `func_1` is called is accurately described: `a` is a list of positive integers with the specified constraints.
   - The state after the loop in `func_1` is also accurately described: if no subarray matches `sorted_a`, the function returns 'No'.
   - The state before `func_2` is called is accurately described: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the array, and `a` is the array itself.
   - The state after processing all test cases in `func_2` is accurately described: `results` contains the results for all test cases, and the `print` statement correctly outputs these results.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will produce the correct output for the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
