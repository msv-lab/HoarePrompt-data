Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is now `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
