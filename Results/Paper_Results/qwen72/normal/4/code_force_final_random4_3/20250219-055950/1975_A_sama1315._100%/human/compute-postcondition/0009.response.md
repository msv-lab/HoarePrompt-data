Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the strings in `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n - 1`.**
