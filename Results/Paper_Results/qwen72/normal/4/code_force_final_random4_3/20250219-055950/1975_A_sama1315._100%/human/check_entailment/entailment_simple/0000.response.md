### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` and checks if it can be transformed into a non-decreasing array by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a new list `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself. This is a clever approach because it allows us to check all possible rotations of the array `a` by looking at subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a`.
   - The function iterates over the possible starting indices `i` of the subarray in `concatenated_a` and checks if the subarray from `i` to `i + n` is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without finding such a subarray, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes `t` with the first element of the list, which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results of all test cases, each on a new line.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read in a single call to `sys.stdin.read` and split into a list of strings.
   - The function correctly processes the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted, with each result on a new line.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array cannot be sorted by any number of operations, as demonstrated in the first test case of the example.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation and handles multiple test cases as required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
