The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the user, each within the range 0 to 200. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if exactly three out of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are no longer relevant, and `t` is the number of test cases processed.
