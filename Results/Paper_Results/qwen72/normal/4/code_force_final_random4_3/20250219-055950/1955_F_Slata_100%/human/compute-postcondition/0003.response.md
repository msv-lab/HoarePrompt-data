The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
