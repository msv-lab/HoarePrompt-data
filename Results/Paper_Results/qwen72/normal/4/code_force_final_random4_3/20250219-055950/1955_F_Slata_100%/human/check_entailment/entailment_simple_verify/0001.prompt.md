You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers where 0 <= p_i[j] <= 200 for j in [0, 1, 2, 3].
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game continues as Eve removes one number at a time.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair has a zero XOR.
   - Specifically, the XOR of two identical numbers is zero, and the XOR of different numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) can be non-zero.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing pairs of numbers that have the same value, as removing a pair of identical numbers will not change the XOR of the remaining numbers.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s), the maximum number of pairs that can be removed is `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` respectively.
   - After removing these pairs, the remaining numbers are `a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 2`, and `d % 2`.

5. **Remaining Numbers**:
   - If the sum of the remaining numbers (after removing pairs) is 3, it means there are three unpaired numbers left, which can be arranged to make the XOR zero.
   - This is because the XOR of three unpaired numbers (1, 2, 3) is zero.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number.
   - It then checks if the sum of the remaining numbers is 3 and adds 1 to the total count if it is.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
   - The logic for counting pairs and checking the sum of remaining numbers is correct.
