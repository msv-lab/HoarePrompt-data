The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might accept input through other means such as global variables or user input. The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, and each test case contains a list `p_i` of four integers, where each integer in the list is within the range 0 to 200. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided in the output description.
