### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of 0 with any number is the number itself.
   - XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - 1 ^ 1 = 0
     - 2 ^ 2 = 0
     - 3 ^ 3 = 0
     - 4 ^ 4 = 0
     - 1 ^ 2 = 3
     - 1 ^ 3 = 2
     - 1 ^ 4 = 5
     - 2 ^ 3 = 1
     - 2 ^ 4 = 6
     - 3 ^ 4 = 7

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) will not change the XOR result.
   - Removing a single number will change the XOR result, and Eve should aim to remove numbers that will make the XOR zero.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The program calculates the number of pairs of each number that can be removed: `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2`.
   - It then adds 1 if exactly three out of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd. This is because if exactly three numbers are odd, removing one of them will make the XOR zero.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed without changing the XOR result.
   - The additional check for exactly three odd numbers is correct because removing one of them will make the XOR zero, thus giving Bob a win.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
