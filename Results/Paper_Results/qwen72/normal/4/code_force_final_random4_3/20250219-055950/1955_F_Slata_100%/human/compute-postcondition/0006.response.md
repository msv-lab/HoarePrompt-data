The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `i` being less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2
- `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 2) for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 2.**
