The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. It returns a list containing `n` lists, where each inner list consists of `m` copies of the value `v`. The function does not modify any of its input parameters. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list, which is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, all filled with the value `v`.
