Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not contain any logic that addresses the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be cut from a regular polygon with given constraints. The functions in the program are mostly unrelated to the problem and seem to be a collection of utility functions for various purposes, such as prime number generation, greatest common divisor (GCD) calculation, and dynamic programming for longest common subsequence, among others. These functions do not directly solve the problem of maximizing the number of triangles in a polygon given a set of vertices.

To solve the problem, you would need a function that takes the number of sides of the polygon, the vertices chosen by Bessie, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version). The function should then calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices. The current program lacks this specific logic.
