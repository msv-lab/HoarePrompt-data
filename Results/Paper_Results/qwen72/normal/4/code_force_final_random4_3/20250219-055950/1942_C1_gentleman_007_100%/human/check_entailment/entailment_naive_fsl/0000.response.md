Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be cut from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions provided are a mix of utilities for various purposes, such as generating prime numbers, performing binary search, and calculating the greatest common divisor, but none of these functions are used in a way that solves the specific problem described. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for the problem at hand.
