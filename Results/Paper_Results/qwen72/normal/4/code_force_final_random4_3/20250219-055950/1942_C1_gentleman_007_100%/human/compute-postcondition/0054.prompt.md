Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q` at the start of the loop, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` remains a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` is now `True` and `q` contains these nodes in the order they were processed. Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop remain unadded to `q` and their `vis` values are unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop will remain unvisited and will not be added to `q`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. `q` will contain at least one element, and `ver` will be the first element that was removed from `q` before the loop started.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
