Output State: **`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver` but now contains `node` at the end. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes. `node` is the second node in `graph[ver]`. `node` has been added to the deque `q` at the end. `vis[node]` is now 1.**
