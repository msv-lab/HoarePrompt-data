The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` must contain at least two elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must have at least three elements, and `node` will be the third element in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least three elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `q` now contains `node` as its new last element, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged.**
