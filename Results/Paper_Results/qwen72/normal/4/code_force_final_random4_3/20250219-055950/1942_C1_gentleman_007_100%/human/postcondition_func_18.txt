The function `func_19` accepts a list `p` of distinct integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It returns the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If all elements in `p` are less than `x`, it returns the length of the list `p`, which is `n`. The function does not modify the list `p` or the integer `x`.
