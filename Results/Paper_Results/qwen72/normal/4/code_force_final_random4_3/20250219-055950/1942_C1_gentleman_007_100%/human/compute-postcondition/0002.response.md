Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, `q` is a deque containing the integer `ver`.** 

The value of `vis[ver]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
