Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. `l` is an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.**
