Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
3. `a` is greater than 0.
4. `i` is 0.
5. `b` and `c` are input integers.
6. `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`).
7. `b` is not equal to `c`.
8. `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
9. `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The output is always the same regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Output: **Yes**
