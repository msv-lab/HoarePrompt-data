### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case.

2. **Base Case**: 
   - If `b` (the number of moves) equals `c` (the desired number of cubes), the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.

3. **Impossible Case**:
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.

4. **Parity Check**:
   - The function checks if `a` (the number of test cases) and `b` (the number of moves) have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). However, this check is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct check should be whether `b` and `c` have the same parity.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes `c` after `b` moves. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will change with each move. Therefore, if `b` and `c` have the same parity, the tower can end up with exactly `c` cubes.

5. **Final Case**:
   - If `b` and `c` do not have the same parity, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Correctness:
The function is incorrect because it checks the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) instead of the parity of `b` (the number of moves) and `c` (the desired number of cubes).

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
