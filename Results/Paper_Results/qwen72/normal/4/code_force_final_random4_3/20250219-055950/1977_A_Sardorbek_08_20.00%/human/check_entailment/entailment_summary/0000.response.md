### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Conditions for Output:**
   - **If `b == c`:** This condition checks if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes. If so, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height. This is correct.
   - **If `b < c`:** This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If so, it is impossible to build a tower of height `c` with only `b` moves. This is correct.
   - **If `a % 2 == b % 2`:** This condition checks if the number of test cases `a` and the number of moves `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, this condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking if `b` and `c` have the same parity, because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for Nikita to achieve the desired height. This is incorrect.
   - **Otherwise, print 'No':** This condition is correct if the above conditions are correctly implemented.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a logical error in the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to ensure that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the final number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves.
