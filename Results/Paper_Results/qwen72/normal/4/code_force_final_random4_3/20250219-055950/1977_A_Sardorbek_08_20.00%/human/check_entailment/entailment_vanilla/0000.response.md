### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The next condition checks if `a % 2 == b % 2`. This is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases and should not be used in the logic for determining the correctness of each test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" because the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must match for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because:
     - If `b` is even, the number of cubes in the tower after `b` moves must also be even (since each move either adds or removes one cube).
     - If `b` is odd, the number of cubes in the tower after `b` moves must also be odd.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it uses `a % 2` instead of `b % 2` in the parity check. This will lead to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
