You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `a` (the final value of `i` is equal to `a`), `b` and `c` are the last input integers, and `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`). If `b` == `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` < `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` >= `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`. Additionally, if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`. If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, and then for each of the `a` test cases, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After the function concludes, `a` is the number of test cases processed, `b` and `c` are the last input integers, and `q` is a tuple containing the last values of `b` and `c`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The next condition checks if `a % 2 == b % 2`. This is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases and should not be used in the logic for determining the correctness of each test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" because the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must match for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because:
     - If `b` is even, the number of cubes in the tower after `b` moves must also be even (since each move either adds or removes one cube).
     - If `b` is odd, the number of cubes in the tower after `b` moves must also be odd.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it uses `a % 2` instead of `b % 2` in the parity check. This will lead to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
