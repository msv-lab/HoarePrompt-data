Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. This condition is incorrect because it checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to ensure that the number of moves `b` and the target number of cubes `c` have the same parity. 

For example, consider the test case where `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem description, this should be a "Yes" case because it is possible to end up with exactly 2 cubes after 4 moves (e.g., put a cube, put a cube, remove a cube, remove a cube). However, the program will incorrectly output "No" because it checks `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`.
