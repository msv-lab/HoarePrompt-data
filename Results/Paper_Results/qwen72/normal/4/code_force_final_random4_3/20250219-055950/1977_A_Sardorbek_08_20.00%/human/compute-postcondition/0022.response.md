Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
3. `a` is greater than 0.
4. `i` is 1.
5. `b` and `c` are input integers.
6. `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`).
7. If `b` == `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`.
8. If `b` < `c`, then `b` is less than `c`.
9. If `b` >= `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`.
10. Additionally, if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`.
11. If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides various conditions and values for the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q`.
- However, the code snippet does not use any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
