Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for certain inputs. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

The expected output is 2 because the only way to achieve scores of 1, 1, and 2 is if two games were played, both of which ended in draws. However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. This indicates that the logic in the program is flawed, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
