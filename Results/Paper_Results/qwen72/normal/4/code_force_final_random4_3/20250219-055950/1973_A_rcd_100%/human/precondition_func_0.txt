The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
