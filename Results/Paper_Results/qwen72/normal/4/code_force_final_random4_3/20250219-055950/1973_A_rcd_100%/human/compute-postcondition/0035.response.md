The code snippet `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from user input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This means the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now updated based on the user input. The initial conditions that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, are still valid. However, the specific values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now based on the user input.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
