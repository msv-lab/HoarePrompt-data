Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is 3, and `y` is `p3 - 3` where `p3` must be at least 4.**

Explanation:
- The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1.
- Initially, `y` is `p3 - 2`.
- After executing `y -= 1`, `y` becomes `p3 - 3`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
