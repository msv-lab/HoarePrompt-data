To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the variables `x` and `y` since they are the only ones in the loop head (`y >= x`).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is equal to `p3`.

The loop condition is `y >= x`. For the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

Right before the loop:
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is equal to `p3`.

Since `p3` is an integer and `p3` ≤ 30, `y` (which is `p3`) is already an integer. The condition `y >= x` simplifies to `p3 >= 0`. Given that `p3` is a user-provided integer and must be less than or equal to 30, it is guaranteed that `p3` is non-negative. Therefore, `y` is already greater than or equal to `x` (which is 0).

Thus, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`**
