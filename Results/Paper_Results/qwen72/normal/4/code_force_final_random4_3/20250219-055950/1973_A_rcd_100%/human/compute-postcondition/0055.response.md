Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to 2 and `y` is updated to `p3 - 2`.**
