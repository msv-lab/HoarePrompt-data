Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, with `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If this condition is never met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and then prints `p3`. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `y` is `p3 - x`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`) remain unchanged.**
