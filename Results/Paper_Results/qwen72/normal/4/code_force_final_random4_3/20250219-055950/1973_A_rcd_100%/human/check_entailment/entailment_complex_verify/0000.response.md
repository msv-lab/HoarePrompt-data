### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect, providing a counterexample where the input is `1 1 2` and the expected output is `2`, but the program outputs `3`.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - It first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, and draws contribute 1 point each, but the sum of points must still be even).
   - If the sum is even, it then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`). If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws is when the two lower scores are fully accounted for by draws.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop iterates while `y` (initially `p3`) is greater than or equal to `x` (initially `0`).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid condition, it prints `p3`.

3. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the program should output `2` because the only way to achieve these scores is if two games were played, both ending in draws.
   - Let's trace the program with this input:
     - `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 2`
     - The sum `p1 + p2 + p3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4` is even, so the program does not print `-1`.
     - `p3 < p1 + p2` is false (`2 < 1 + 1` is false), so the program enters the loop.
     - The loop initializes `x = 0` and `y = 2`.
     - First iteration: `p1 - x = 1 - 0 = 1` and `p2 - y = 1 - 2 = -1`. The condition `1 <= -1` is false, so `x` is incremented to `1` and `y` is decremented to `1`.
     - Second iteration: `p1 - x = 1 - 1 = 0` and `p2 - y = 1 - 1 = 0`. The condition `0 <= 0` is true, so the program prints `p1 - x + p3 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The program correctly outputs `2` for the input `1 1 2`.

4. **General Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the sum of scores is odd by printing `-1`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2` by printing `p1 + p2`.
   - The loop logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting `x` and `y` to balance the scores. The loop ensures that the maximum number of draws is found by checking the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The program correctly handles the input `1 1 2` and other potential cases. The logic in the program is sound and produces the correct results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
