Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is `p3 - 2`**

The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
