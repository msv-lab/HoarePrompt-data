Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`, `i` is `x-1`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.** 

The value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[x-1]` to its previous value, which was the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. The value of `ans2` remains unchanged and is still equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. All other variables retain their initial states.
