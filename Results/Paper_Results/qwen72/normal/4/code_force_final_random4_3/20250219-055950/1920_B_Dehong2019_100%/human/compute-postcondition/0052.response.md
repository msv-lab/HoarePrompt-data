Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than `x`, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the maximum value between the original `ans2` and the adjusted `ans1`.**
