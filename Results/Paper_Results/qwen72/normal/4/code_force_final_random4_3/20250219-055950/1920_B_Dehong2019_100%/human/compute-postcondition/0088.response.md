Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `i` is 2. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[2 + x]` and `ans2` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by `a[2]` and `ans2` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.***
