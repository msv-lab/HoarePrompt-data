Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `l` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `p`) remain unchanged. The new value of `l` is now a list of integers based on the user's input.
