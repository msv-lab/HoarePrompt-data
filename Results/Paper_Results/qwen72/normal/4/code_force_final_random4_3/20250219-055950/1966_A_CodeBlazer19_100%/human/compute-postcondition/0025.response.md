The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `cards` and an integer `k`. The list `cards` represents the numbers on the cards, and `k` represents the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The length of `cards` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each element in `cards` is an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). The value of `k` is constrained to be between 2 and 100 (2 ≤ k ≤ 100).

The function returns the maximum possible sum of the elements in the `cards` list after performing the allowed number of exchanges (`k` times).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `cards` and an integer `k`. It returns the maximum possible sum of the elements in `cards` after performing up to `k` exchanges.**
