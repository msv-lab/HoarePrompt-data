Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The program checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k` and, if so, prints `k - 1`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations or the fact that the minimum number of cards left can be less than `k - 1` depending on the distribution of card numbers.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many full exchanges can be made for each card number.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after all possible exchanges.
4. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of the remainders after performing the exchanges for each card number, plus the number of card types that have a count less than `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        min_cards = sum((x % k for x in p if x >= k)) + len([x for x in p if x < k])
        print(min_cards)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by summing the remainders of the counts of each card number when divided by `k` and adding the number of card types that have a count less than `k`. This ensures that the program accounts for all possible operations and gives the correct minimum number of cards left.
