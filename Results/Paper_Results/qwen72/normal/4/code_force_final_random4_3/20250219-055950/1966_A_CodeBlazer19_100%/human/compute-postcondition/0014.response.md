Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(k - 1)
```

This statement will print the value of `k - 1`. Since `k` is an input integer, the exact value of `k` is not known from the initial state. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
