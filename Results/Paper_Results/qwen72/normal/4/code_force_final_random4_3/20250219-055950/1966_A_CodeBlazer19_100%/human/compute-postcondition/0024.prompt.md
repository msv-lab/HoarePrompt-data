Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The list `cards` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element in `cards` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
    if max(p) >= k:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`, the program follows the logic for the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
