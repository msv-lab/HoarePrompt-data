Reasoning:

The problem requires dividing a set of integers into groups such that no two integers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. The function `func_1` is intended to solve this problem by counting the number of unique elements after applying a bitwise transformation. However, the transformation used in the function, `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

### Explanation of the Transformation:
- `1 << 31` is a bit shift operation that shifts the binary number `1` 31 positions to the left, resulting in `10000000000000000000000000000000` in binary, which is `2147483648` in decimal.
- `(1 << 31) - 1` is `11111111111111111111111111111111` in binary, which is `2147483647` in decimal. This is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.
- `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all the bits of `num` in the 31 least significant bits.

### Issues with the Transformation:
- The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` is intended to flip all the bits of `num` in the 31 least significant bits. However, this transformation does not help in determining the minimum number of groups required.
- The problem requires that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. The transformation does not ensure this condition. Instead, it simply flips the bits, which does not guarantee that the resulting numbers will be unique or that they will satisfy the condition of having no matching bits.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach to solve this problem is to recognize that the condition `x_2(i) \neq y_2(i)` for all `1 \leq i < 32` means that no two numbers in the same group can have the same bit pattern in the 31 least significant bits.
- The maximum number of unique bit patterns in the 31 least significant bits is \(2^{31}\), but the problem is more constrained. The minimum number of groups required is the number of unique bit patterns in the input list `a`.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should count the number of unique bit patterns in the input list `a` by using a set to keep track of the unique elements.

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    unique_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        unique_patterns.add(num & ((1 << 31) - 1))
    return len(unique_patterns)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it uses an incorrect transformation and does not count the unique bit patterns in the 31 least significant bits.

Correctness: **False**
