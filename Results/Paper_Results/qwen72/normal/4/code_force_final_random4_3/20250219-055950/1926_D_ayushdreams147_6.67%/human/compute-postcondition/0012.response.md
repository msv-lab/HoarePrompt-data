Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `count[num]` is decremented by 1, where `num` is the second element in the list `a`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
