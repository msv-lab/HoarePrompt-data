You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element. The transformation flips the highest bit of each integer in the list. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function attempts to count the number of unique numbers by using a bitwise XOR operation with `1 << 31 - 1`, which is equivalent to `0x7FFFFFFF` (a number with the 31 least significant bits set to 1). However, this approach does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- The numbers `0`, `1`, and `2` have the following binary representations:
  - `0` = `00000000000000000000000000000000`
  - `1` = `00000000000000000000000000000001`
  - `2` = `00000000000000000000000000000010`

- According to the problem, `0` and `1` can be in the same group because they do not have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.
- Similarly, `0` and `2` can be in the same group.
- Therefore, the minimum number of groups required is `2`.

However, the provided program incorrectly outputs `3`, indicating that it does not correctly handle the grouping logic.
