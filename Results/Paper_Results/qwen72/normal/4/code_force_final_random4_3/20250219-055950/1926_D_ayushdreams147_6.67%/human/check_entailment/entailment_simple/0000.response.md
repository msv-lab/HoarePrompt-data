Reasoning:

The problem requires dividing a list of integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. The function `func_1` attempts to solve this by counting the number of unique elements after applying a transformation to each number. However, the transformation used, `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, is not appropriate for the problem.

### Issues:
1. **Transformation Misunderstanding**:
   - The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all the bits of `num` except the 32nd bit (which is always 0 for the given range of numbers). This means that if `num` is 0, the transformation will result in `2147483647` (which is `1111111111111111111111111111111` in binary).
   - This transformation does not ensure that the 31 least significant bits are unique. For example, if `num` is `0` and `num` is `2147483647`, they will both be transformed to the same value, which is incorrect.

2. **Counting Logic**:
   - The logic of decrementing the count of `num` when it is already in the dictionary is flawed. This does not correctly account for the number of groups needed.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of unique bit patterns in the 31 least significant bits. This can be done by using a set to keep track of the bit patterns.

### Correct Approach:
- For each number, extract the 31 least significant bits.
- Use a set to keep track of the unique bit patterns.
- The size of the set will give the minimum number of groups required.

### Example:
- For the input `1 4 3 4`, the 31 least significant bits are `1`, `4`, `3`, and `4` respectively. The unique bit patterns are `{1, 4, 3}`, so the minimum number of groups required is 3, not 4 as the function currently returns.
- For the input `0 2147483647`, the 31 least significant bits are `0` and `2147483647` respectively. The unique bit patterns are `{0, 2147483647}`, so the minimum number of groups required is 1, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem because the transformation used does not ensure that the 31 least significant bits are unique, and the counting logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
