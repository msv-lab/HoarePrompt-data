The loop head contains the condition `i < N`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` or `N` to satisfy this condition. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `N`, which means the condition `i < N` is not met, and the loop would not execute again without modification.

To make the loop execute one more time:
- We can decrement `i` by 1, or
- Increment `N` by 1.

However, since `N` is an input integer and is part of the tuple in the `cases` list, it should not be modified. Therefore, the only viable option is to decrement `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**
