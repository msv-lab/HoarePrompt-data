Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle the case where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums intersect at more than one point. Specifically, the condition `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]): return 0` is too restrictive and will incorrectly return 0 for valid cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 4 4
1 2 3 4
4 5 6 6
```

In this case:
- The prefix maximums are at indices 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The suffix maximums are at indices 4, 5, 6, and 6.

The permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is a valid permutation that satisfies the given conditions. However, the program will return 0 because `L[-2] == 3` and `R[1] == 5`, which does not satisfy the condition `L[-2] == R[1]`. Therefore, the program incorrectly returns 0 for this valid case.
