Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer greater than 1, `M2` is an input integer greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.**
