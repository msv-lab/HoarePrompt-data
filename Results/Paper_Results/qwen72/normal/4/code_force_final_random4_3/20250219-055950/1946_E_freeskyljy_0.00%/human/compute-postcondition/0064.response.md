Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, and `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M2` > 1, `i` is `N`, and `nums_left` is `0`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is the index of the last element in `R` that is less than `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is the index of the last element in `R`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` for each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `cur` remains `M1 - 2` or 0 or -1, depending on whether `L[cur]` was encountered during the loop.***
