Output State: **`i` is `N`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is `0`. `cur` is the index of the last element in `R` that is less than `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is the index of the last element in `R`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` for each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `N`.
- The variable `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so after all iterations, it will be `0`.
- The variable `cur` is incremented each time `i` equals an element in `R`. Therefore, after all iterations, `cur` will be the index of the last element in `R` that is less than `N`.
- If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` starts as the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`, multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`.
- For each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- The loop will stop when `i` reaches `N`, and `nums_left` will be `0` at that point.
