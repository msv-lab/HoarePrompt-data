Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans`, which is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, if `M1` > 1 and `M2` > 1. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` for each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and the final value of `ans` is returned.**
