Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
