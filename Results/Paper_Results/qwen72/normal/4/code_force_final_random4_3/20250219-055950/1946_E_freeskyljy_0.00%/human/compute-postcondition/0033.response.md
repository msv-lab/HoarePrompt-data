Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer greater than 3, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `N - 3` and `i` must be greater than 1. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`. `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.
- The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `i`, `MOD`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `i` is not equal to `L[cur]` is still valid.
- The precondition that `i` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
