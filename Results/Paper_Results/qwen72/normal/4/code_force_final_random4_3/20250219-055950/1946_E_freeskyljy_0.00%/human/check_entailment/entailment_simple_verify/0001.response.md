### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, and the lists `L` and `R` containing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Basic Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. This is necessary because the last prefix maximum must also be the first suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is correct because the first prefix maximum must be at index 1, and the first suffix maximum must be at index `N`.

3. **Overlap Check:**
   - The program checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If they are equal, it returns 0 because this would imply an invalid permutation. This check is correct and necessary to avoid invalid permutations.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to arrange the elements using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is correct because it correctly counts the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the positions before the last prefix maximum, which is also the first suffix maximum.

5. **Left Side Calculation:**
   - If `M1` is greater than 1, it iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each index that is not a prefix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the left side of the permutation. This logic is correct and ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions according to the prefix maximums.

6. **Right Side Calculation:**
   - If `M2` is greater than 1, it iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each index that is not a suffix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the right side of the permutation. This logic is correct and ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions according to the suffix maximums.

7. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that the final answer is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers. This is correctly applied to ensure the answer fits within the required constraints.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Checks:**
  - The checks for `L[-1] != R[0]`, `L[0] != 1`, and `R[0] != N` are essential and correctly implemented. These conditions ensure that the permutation is valid and aligns with the given prefix and suffix maximums.

- **Overlap Check:**
  - The check for `M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]` is necessary to avoid invalid permutations where the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum overlap. This check is correctly implemented.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is correct. It counts the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the positions before the last prefix maximum, which is also the first suffix maximum.

- **Left Side Calculation:**
  - The loop that iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element correctly multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the left side of the permutation. The loop updates `ans` and `nums_left` appropriately.

- **Right Side Calculation:**
  - The loop that iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element correctly multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the right side of the permutation. The loop updates `ans` and `nums_left` appropriately.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation is correctly applied in both the left and right side calculations to ensure the answer fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It performs the necessary checks and calculations to determine the number of valid permutations. The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

### Final:
**True**
