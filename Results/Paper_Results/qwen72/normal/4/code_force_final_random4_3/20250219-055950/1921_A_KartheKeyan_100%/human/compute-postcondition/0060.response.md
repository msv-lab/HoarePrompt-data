The function `func` accepts a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of four tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The function returns the area of each square for the given test cases.
