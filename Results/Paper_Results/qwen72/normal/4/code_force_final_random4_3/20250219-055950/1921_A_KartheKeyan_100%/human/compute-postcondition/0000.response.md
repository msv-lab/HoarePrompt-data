Output State: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. `n` is an input integer, `s` is the result of the calculation `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` for each iteration, and `n` is decremented by 1 after each iteration. The value of `s` is printed for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- The while loop runs as long as `n` is non-zero.
- Inside the loop, `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts another input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- The variable `s` is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- `s` is then updated to the value of `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.
- The value of `s` is printed.
- `n` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
- The initial state variables (the list of test cases, the coordinates, and the number of test cases) remain unchanged and are still valid.
