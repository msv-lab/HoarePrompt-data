Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is decreased by 1, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code `coord = []` reassigns the variable `coord` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
