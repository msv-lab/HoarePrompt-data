Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared distance between the first and second points in the `coord` list and assigns it to the variable `p1`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `range`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The squared distance is computed using the formula for the Euclidean distance between two points, but without taking the square root, as only the squared distance is needed.
