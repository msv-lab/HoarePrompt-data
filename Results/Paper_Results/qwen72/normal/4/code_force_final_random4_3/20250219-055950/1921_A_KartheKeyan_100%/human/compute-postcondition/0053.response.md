Output State: **`i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `range` remains 4.
- The values of `x` and `y` are still the input integers.
- The list `coord` is now sorted based on the tuples `(x, y)`. Since all tuples in `coord` are the same `(x, y)`, the list remains unchanged after sorting. Therefore, `coord` still contains four tuples of `(x, y)`, but it is now explicitly sorted.
