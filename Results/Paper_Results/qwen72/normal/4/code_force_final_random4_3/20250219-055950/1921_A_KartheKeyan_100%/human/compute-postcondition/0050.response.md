Output State: **`i` is 2, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`**

Explanation: The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. The other variables, `i` and `range`, remain unchanged. The list `coord` still contains two tuples, each with the updated values of `x` and `y`.
