The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the `range` object, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range being 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `range` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The `range` remains 4 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is 1, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`**
