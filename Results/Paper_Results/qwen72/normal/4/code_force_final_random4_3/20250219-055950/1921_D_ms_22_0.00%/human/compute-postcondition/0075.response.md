Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]` and `b[tp2]` respectively. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff2`, and `ans` are still valid.***
