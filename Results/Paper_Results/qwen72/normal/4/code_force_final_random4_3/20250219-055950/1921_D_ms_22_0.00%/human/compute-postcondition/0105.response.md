Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**
