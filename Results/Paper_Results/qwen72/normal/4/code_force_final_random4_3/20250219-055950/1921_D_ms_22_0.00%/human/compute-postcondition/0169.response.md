Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

The code snippet `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` is now a sorted list of integers, while the rest of the variables retain their initial properties and values.
