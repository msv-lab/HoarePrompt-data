Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet used in the previous iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tp2` is updated to `m - 1`.
- All other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
