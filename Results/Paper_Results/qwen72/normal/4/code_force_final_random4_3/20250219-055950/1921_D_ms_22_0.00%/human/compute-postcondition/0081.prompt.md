Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple is either `(-diff1, a[j], 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, a[j], m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `j` is the index of the element in `a` and `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `a[j]` and `b[0]` and `b[m - 1]` respectively, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements from `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[m - 1])`, and if `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `abs(item[1] - b[0])`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `ans` is increased by `item[0]`, and if `item[2]` is `0`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. If `item[2]` is not `0`, `tp1` remains `0` and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` remains unchanged. If `item[2] == tp2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff1`, and `diff2` are still valid. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then if `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is updated to `ans + (-item[0])`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tp1` remains unchanged and `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
