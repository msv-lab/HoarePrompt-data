Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, and `ans` remain unchanged (except for the update to `ans`).**
