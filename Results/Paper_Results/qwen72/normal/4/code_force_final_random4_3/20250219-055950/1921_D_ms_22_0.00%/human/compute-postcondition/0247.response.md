The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases, each involving two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers, `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and the integers in the lists `a_i` and `b_i` are within the range `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`. The function is expected to handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not detailed in the provided constraints.**
