Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`.
- The initial state specifies that `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, so after executing the code, `b` is now a sorted list of integers.
- The other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.
