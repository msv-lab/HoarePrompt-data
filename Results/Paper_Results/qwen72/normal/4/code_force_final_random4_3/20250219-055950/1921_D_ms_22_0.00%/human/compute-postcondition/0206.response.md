Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the larger of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2`. The second element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b` (i.e., `b[0]`). `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[tp2]`).***
