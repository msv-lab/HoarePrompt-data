Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`. `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `diff1 = abs(i - b[0])` updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.
- The initial state already specifies that `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, so the value of `diff1` is now explicitly calculated and matches the initial state.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
