Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the user input.
- The values of `n` and `m` are now specific integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
