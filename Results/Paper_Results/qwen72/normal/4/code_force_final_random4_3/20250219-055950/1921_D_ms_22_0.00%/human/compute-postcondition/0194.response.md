Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, where each tuple is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- `max_heap` will contain a tuple for each element in the list `a`. Each tuple will have the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between the element `i` and the first element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. Otherwise, the tuple will have the form `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
- The variable `t` will be decremented by the length of the list `a` (i.e., `t` is `t - len(a)`).
- The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
