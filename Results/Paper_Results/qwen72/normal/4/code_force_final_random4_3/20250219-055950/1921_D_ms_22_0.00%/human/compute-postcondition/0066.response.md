Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` remains unchanged. If `item[2] == tp2`, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
