Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated based on the condition. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is the larger of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to 0, `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is `m - 2`.***
