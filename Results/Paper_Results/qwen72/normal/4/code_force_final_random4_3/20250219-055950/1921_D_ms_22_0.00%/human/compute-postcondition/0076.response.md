Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `ans` conditions are still valid, `ans` is updated to `ans + (-item[0])`.** 

The value of `ans` is now increased by the negative of the first element of the tuple `item` that was popped from `max_heap`. All other conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
