Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`.**

The code snippet `diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])` calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the value at index `tp2` in the list `b`. This value is stored in the variable `diff2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
