Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1 - 1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, the conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff2`, and `ans` are still valid.**

In natural language: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The `diff1` value now reflects the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element in `b` at the new `tp1 - 1` index.
