Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements for every potential case. It uses a max heap to prioritize the largest differences and ensures that the selected elements from `b` are not reused by adjusting the pointers `tp1` and `tp2`. The logic of choosing the maximum difference between the smallest and largest available elements in `b` for each element in `a` is consistent with the goal of maximizing the total difference \( D \). The program also handles edge cases, such as when all elements in `b` are the same, and multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
