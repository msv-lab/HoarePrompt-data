Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The correct output should be a string that contains all 9 possible subsequences of length 2 using the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` (i.e., `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`). However, the program generates the string `abcabc`, which does not contain all these subsequences. Specifically, it is missing `cc`.

A correct approach would involve generating a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` are present. One such approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of a given length appears as a substring. However, for this problem, a simpler approach can be used to construct the string by ensuring that each character is followed by every other character in a way that all combinations are covered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    result = s[:k]
    for j in range(n-1):
        result += s[:k-1] + s[k-1]
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are present in the generated string `s`. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 3`, it will generate `abcabcbac`, which contains all 9 required subsequences.
