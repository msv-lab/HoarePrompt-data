Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`**

Explanation:
- The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`.
- `i` is `n-1`, so the code appends `abs(a[n-1] - b[-(n - (n-1))])` which simplifies to `abs(a[n-1] - b[-1])`.
- The state of other variables remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` now includes the previous absolute differences and the new one calculated from `a[n-1]` and `b[-1]`.
