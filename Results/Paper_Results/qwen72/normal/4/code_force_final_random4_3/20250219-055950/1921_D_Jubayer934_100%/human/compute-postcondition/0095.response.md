Output State: **`i` is `temp`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the absolute difference between `a[n]` and `b[-(n - n)]` has been appended to `ans`.**
