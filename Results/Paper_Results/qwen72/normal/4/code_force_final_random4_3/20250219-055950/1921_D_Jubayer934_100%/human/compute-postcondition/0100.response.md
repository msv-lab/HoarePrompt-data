The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the length of `a_i` and `m` is the length of `b_i`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Assuming the function returns a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
