### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` which represent the lengths of Petya's array and the available integers for Vasya, respectively.
   - It then reads and sorts Petya's array `a` and Vasya's available integers `b` in descending order.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is a good strategy because it helps in maximizing the difference between corresponding elements.
   - By sorting `a` in ascending order, we ensure that the smallest elements of `a` are paired with the largest elements of `b` (and vice versa) to maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Initial Pairing:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `b` (since `m >= n` and we only need `n` elements from `b`).
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in `b` and appends it to `ans`.

4. **Optimal Pairing Adjustment:**
   - The function checks if there is a better way to pair the elements of `a` with the elements of `b` by comparing the absolute differences of the current pairing with the reverse pairing.
   - If the reverse pairing (`b[-(n - i)]`) results in a larger absolute difference, it stops the initial pairing and starts the reverse pairing from that point.
   - This adjustment ensures that the function maximizes the total difference `D`.

5. **Summing the Differences:**
   - After all the absolute differences are calculated and stored in `ans`, the function prints the sum of the differences for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The initial approach of pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` is a good starting point to maximize the absolute differences.
  - The adjustment step ensures that if the reverse pairing provides a better result, it is used instead.
  - The function correctly handles the constraints and the multiple test cases.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles cases where all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case where `b` is all 1s).
  - It also handles cases where `n` is equal to `m` and where `n` is less than `m`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting operations are efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\).
  - The overall complexity is \(O(t \cdot (n \log n + m \log m))\), which is acceptable given the constraints.
