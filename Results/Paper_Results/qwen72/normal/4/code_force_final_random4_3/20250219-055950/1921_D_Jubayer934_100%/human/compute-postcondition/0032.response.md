To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `temp` is an index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, or -1 if the condition was never met.
   - `ans` is a list that contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1` if `temp` is not -1.
   - `i` is set to `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is populated with the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is the last index where the loop executed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of the elements in the `ans` list.
   - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged, and the sum of `ans` will be the sum of whatever was in `ans` before the loop.

Given the initial state and conditions, the output will depend on the value of `temp`:

- **If `temp` is not -1**:
  - `ans` will contain the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
  - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of these absolute differences.

- **If `temp` is -1**:
  - `ans` will remain unchanged.
  - The `print(sum(ans))` statement will print the sum of the elements in `ans` as it was before the loop.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences as described.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1` if `temp` is not -1, or the sum of the elements in `ans` as it was before the loop if `temp` is -1)**
