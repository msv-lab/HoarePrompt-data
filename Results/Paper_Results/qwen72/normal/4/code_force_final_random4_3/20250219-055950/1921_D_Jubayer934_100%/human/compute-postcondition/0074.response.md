Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, and the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[-n]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.**

The value of `temp` is updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
