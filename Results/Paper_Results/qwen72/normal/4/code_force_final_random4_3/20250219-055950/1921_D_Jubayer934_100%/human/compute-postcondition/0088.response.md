Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `temp` remains -1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop completes all `n` iterations.
- The variable `i` ends up being `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`.
- The variable `temp` remains `-1` because the loop did not break early.
- The other variables (`t`, `a_i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
