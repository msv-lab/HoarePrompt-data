Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. `i` is set to `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke. `temp` remains the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and it is not -1. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is the last index where the loop executed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke.***
