Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the value of `i` where the loop breaks, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.**
