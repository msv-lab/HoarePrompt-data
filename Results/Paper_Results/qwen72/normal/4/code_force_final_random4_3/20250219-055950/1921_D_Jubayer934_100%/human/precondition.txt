t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) of integers (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second element is a tuple of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third element is a tuple of m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
