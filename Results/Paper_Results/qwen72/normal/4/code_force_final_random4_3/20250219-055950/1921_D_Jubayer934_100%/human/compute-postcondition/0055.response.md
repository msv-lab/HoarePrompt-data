Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1 or the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `t` and `a_i` remain unchanged at -1.
- The variable `temp` will be -1 if the loop completes all `n` iterations without breaking, or it will be set to the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true.
- The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain the same as they were initially, representing the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with `a` being the first `n` integers from the sorted input and `b` being the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all `n` iterations, or it will be the value of `i` where the loop breaks.
