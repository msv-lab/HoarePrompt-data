The code snippet `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` impacts the variable `b` by assigning it a sorted list of the first `m` integers from the input, in descending order. The input is split into a list of integers, which are then sorted in reverse order (from largest to smallest), and the first `m` elements of this sorted list are assigned to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. `temp` is -1. `ans` is an empty list. `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.**
