Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the list `a`.**

The value of `x` is now the integer at the index `f` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
