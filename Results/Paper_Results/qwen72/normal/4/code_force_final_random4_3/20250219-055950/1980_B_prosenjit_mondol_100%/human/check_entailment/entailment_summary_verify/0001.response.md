### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is stored in `x` using `a[f]`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Comparison:**
   - The function checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the k-th cube after sorting (`a[k]`).
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. The function prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond. The function then checks:
       - If `k == n - 1`, it means the favorite cube is the last cube after sorting, so it will not be removed. The function prints "YES".
       - If `a[k + 1] < x`, it means the favorite cube is not in the k-th position but in a position beyond `k`, so it will not be removed. The function prints "YES".
       - Otherwise, the favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond, so it may be removed or not. The function prints "MAYBE".

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `a[k] > x`**
  - This means the favorite cube's value is less than the value of the k-th cube after sorting. Therefore, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes and will not be removed.
  - **Correct**: The function correctly prints "NO" in this case.

- **Condition 2: `a[k] < x`**
  - This means the favorite cube's value is greater than the value of the k-th cube after sorting. Therefore, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes and will be removed.
  - **Correct**: The function correctly prints "YES" in this case.

- **Condition 3: `a[k] == x`**
  - This means the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting. The favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond.
  - **Sub-condition 1: `k == n - 1`**
    - If `k` is the last index, the favorite cube is the last cube after sorting and will not be removed.
    - **Correct**: The function correctly prints "YES" in this case.
  - **Sub-condition 2: `a[k + 1] < x`**
    - If the value of the (k+1)-th cube is less than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube is not in the k-th position and will not be removed.
    - **Correct**: The function correctly prints "YES" in this case.
  - **Sub-condition 3: `a[k + 1] == x`**
    - If the value of the (k+1)-th cube is equal to the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond, so it may be removed or not.
    - **Correct**: The function correctly prints "MAYBE" in this case.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when `k == 0`**:
  - If `k == 0`, the function checks if `a[0] > x` or `a[0] < x`. If `a[0] == x`, it will print "YES" if `k == n - 1` or `a[1] < x`, otherwise "MAYBE".
  - This is correct because if the favorite cube is the largest, it will be removed if `k == 0`.

- **Case when `k == n - 1`**:
  - If `k == n - 1`, the function checks if `a[n-1] > x` or `a[n-1] < x`. If `a[n-1] == x`, it will print "YES" because the favorite cube is the last one and will not be removed.
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the values and positions after sorting.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
