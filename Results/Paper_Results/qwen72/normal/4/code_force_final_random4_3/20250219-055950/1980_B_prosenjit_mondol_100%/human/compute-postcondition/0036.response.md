Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
3. `n` is the first integer from the new input.
4. `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 3.
5. `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 3.
6. `a` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in descending order.
7. `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting.
8. If `a[k]` > `a[f]`, the condition holds.
9. If `a[k]` < `a[f]`, the condition holds.
10. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string 'YES'.
- The condition described in the initial state is not directly checked in the code snippet. Therefore, we need to determine if the condition is always met based on the given information.

### Condition Analysis:
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `f` and `k` are indices into the list `a`, where `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 3, and `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 3.
- The condition checks if `a[k]` is either greater than or less than `a[f]`.

Since `a` is sorted in descending order:
- `a[0]` is the largest element.
- `a[1]` is the second largest element.
- `a[2]` is the third largest element, and so on.

Given that `f` and `k` are indices derived from the input, and assuming `f` and `k` are valid indices (i.e., they are within the bounds of the list `a`), the following scenarios can occur:
- If `k < f`, then `a[k]` will be greater than `a[f]` because `a` is sorted in descending order.
- If `k > f`, then `a[k]` will be less than `a[f]` because `a` is sorted in descending order.
- If `k == f`, then `a[k]` will be equal to `a[f]`, which means the condition does not hold.

However, the problem states that the condition holds if `a[k]` is either greater than or less than `a[f]`. Therefore, the condition will always hold unless `k == f`.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition will always hold unless `k == f`, and the code snippet does not check this condition, it will always print 'YES'.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
