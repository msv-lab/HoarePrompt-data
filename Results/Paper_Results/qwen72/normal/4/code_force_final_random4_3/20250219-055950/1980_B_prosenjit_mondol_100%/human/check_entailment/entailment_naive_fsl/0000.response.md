Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube in the sorted list, and there are multiple cubes with the same value. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if the value of the k-th cube is equal to the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube will always be removed. However, this is not necessarily true, as the favorite cube could be in a position greater than k and not be removed.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 3 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, and the favorite cube could end up in any of the positions 1 to 4. Since k = 2, the favorite cube could be removed (if it ends up in positions 1 or 2) or not removed (if it ends up in positions 3 or 4). Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE," but the program outputs "YES."
