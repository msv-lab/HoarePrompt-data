The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, which ensures that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, to clearly state the condition for the loop to run, we can rephrase it as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
