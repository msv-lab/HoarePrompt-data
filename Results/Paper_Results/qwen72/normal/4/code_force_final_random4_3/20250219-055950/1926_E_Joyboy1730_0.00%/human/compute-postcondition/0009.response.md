Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `_`, `L`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `L` are still valid.
- The value of `m` is still `(n + 1) // 2`, but `n` has been updated.
