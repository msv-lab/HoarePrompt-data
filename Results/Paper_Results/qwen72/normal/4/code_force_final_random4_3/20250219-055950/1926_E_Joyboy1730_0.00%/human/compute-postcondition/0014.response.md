Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is an empty list, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is 0.**

The variable `tot` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of `tot` being 0.
