Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations + 1, `a` is the last element in the list `L` (which is undefined since `L` is empty).**

Explanation:
- `m` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
