Postcondition: ***`L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `L`, `a`, or `tot`.***
