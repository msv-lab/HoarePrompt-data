Postcondition: ***`L` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, `tot` is updated to `tot + a`, `k` is updated to `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is updated to `4 * pow`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tot`, `k`, and `pow` retain their original values.***
