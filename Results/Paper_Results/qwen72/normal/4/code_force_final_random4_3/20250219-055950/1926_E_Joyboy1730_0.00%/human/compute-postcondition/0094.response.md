To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `L` is a non-empty list.
- `a` is the first element in `L`.
- `tot` is less than `k`.
- `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`a`**: This is the first element of the list `L`. Since `L` is non-empty, `a` is a well-defined value.
2. **`tot`**: This is a variable that is less than `k`.
3. **`k`**: This is a variable that is greater than `tot` and less than or equal to `tot + a`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

- **`pow`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is a variable that is expected to be defined in the context of the code.
- **`2 * k - 1`**: This is a formula that depends on the value of `k`. Given the constraints:
  - `k > tot`
  - `k <= tot + a`

  We can infer that `k` is a value between `tot` and `tot + a` (inclusive).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`. Since `pow` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **pow * (2 * k - 1) (where `pow` is the value of the variable `pow`, and `k` is a value such that `tot < k <= tot + a`)**
