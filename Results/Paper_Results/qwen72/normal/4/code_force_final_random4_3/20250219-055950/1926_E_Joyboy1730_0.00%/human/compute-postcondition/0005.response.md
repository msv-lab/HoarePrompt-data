Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is a non-zero input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to (n + 1) // 2.**

The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
