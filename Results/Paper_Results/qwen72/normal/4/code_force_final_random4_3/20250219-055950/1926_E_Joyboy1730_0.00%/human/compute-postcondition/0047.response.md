Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `a` is the last element in the list `L` (which is undefined since `L` is empty)**

Explanation:
- `L` remains an empty list.
- `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` remains `k - tot` after the last iteration, with `tot` still being 0.
- `_` remains a placeholder variable.
- `m` is the value of `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `tot` remains 0 since `L` is still empty.
- `a` remains undefined because `L` is still empty.
