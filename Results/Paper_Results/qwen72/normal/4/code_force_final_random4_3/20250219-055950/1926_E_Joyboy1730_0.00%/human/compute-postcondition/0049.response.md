Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `a` is undefined since `L` is empty.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `m` will be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, with `L` still being an empty list, `t` still being an input integer within the specified range, `k` still being `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` still being a placeholder variable, `tot` still being 0 (as the sum of an empty list is 0), and `a` still being undefined because `L` is empty.
