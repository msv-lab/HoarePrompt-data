Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is 0 for all test cases, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration for each test case, `L` is a non-empty list with elements that were generated during the execution of the loop, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for each test case, `pow` is `2^len(L)` if the loop did not break, or `2^(i+1)` where `i` is the index of the element in `L` that caused the loop to break, and `a` is the last element of `L` that was processed for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: The loop `for _ in range(t)` has completed all `t` iterations, so `t` is now 0.
- **`n` is 0 for all test cases**: For each test case, the loop `while n:` continues until `n` becomes 0.
- **`k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration for each test case**: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the cumulative sum `tot` after each iteration of the inner loop.
- **`L` is a non-empty list with elements that were generated during the execution of the loop**: The list `L` contains elements that were generated during the execution of the loop, specifically the values of `m` that were calculated.
- **`tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for each test case**: The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in the list `L` for each test case.
- **`pow` is `2^len(L)` if the loop did not break, or `2^(i+1)` where `i` is the index of the element in `L` that caused the loop to break**: The variable `pow` is updated by multiplying by 2 for each element in `L` that is processed. If the loop breaks due to the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, `pow` is `2^(i+1)` where `i` is the index of the element `a` that caused the break.
- **`a` is the last element of `L` that was processed for each test case**: The variable `a` is the last element in `L` that was processed during the loop execution for each test case. If the loop breaks, `a` is the element that satisfied the breaking condition.
