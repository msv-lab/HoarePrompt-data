Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is a list that must have at least `len(L)` elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, `a` is the last element in the list `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` at any iteration, the loop breaks and prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `L` is a list with at least `t` elements, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `pow` is `2^t` (2 raised to the power of `t`), `a` is the last element in `L` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `a` is the element in `L` that satisfies `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `L` is a non-empty list with at least `len(L)` elements, `tot` is the sum of the first `len(L)` elements of `L`, `k` is the input `k` minus the cumulative sum of `tot` after each iteration, `pow` is `2^len(L)` if the loop did not break, or `2^(i+1)` where `i` is the index of the element in `L` that caused the loop to break, and `a` is the last element of `L` that was processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
