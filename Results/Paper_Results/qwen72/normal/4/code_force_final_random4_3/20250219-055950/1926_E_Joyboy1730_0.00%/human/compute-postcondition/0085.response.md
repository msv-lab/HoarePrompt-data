Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is undefined, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The value of `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2` as it was defined before. All other variables remain unchanged.
