The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer, but it is not specified whether it is non-zero. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is a non-zero input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is an empty list**
