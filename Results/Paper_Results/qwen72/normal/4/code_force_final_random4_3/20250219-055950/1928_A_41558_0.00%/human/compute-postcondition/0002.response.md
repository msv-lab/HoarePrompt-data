Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input.**

The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided, where the input is split into two integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
