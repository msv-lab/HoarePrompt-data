Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the state of the variables also remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
