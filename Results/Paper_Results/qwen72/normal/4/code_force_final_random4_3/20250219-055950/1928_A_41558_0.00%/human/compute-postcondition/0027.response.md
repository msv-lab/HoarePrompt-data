The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts an integer `t` and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b`. The constraints are as follows: `1 <= t <= 10^4` and for each test case, `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically in such scenarios, the function would return some result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
