Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition holds and 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is exactly twice `b` or `b` is exactly twice `a`, the condition also holds and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `t` remains within its initial range (1 to 10^4), and `n` is the number of test cases provided. The loop index `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the loop). For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are provided by the user input, and the loop checks if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other. If either of these conditions is true, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed. The state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged for each iteration, and the loop completes its execution for all `n` test cases.
