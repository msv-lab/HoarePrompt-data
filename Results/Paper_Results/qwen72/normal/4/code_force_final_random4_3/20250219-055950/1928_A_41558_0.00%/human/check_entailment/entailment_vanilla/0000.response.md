### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`
     - This condition checks if both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd.
     - If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides because an odd number cannot be divided into two equal integers.
     - Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`
     - This condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
     - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle will result in two rectangles that are the same as the original when rotated.
     - For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, but these two 2x2 rectangles can only form a 2x4 or 4x2 rectangle, which are the same as the original.
     - Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **Else**:
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".
     - This means that at least one of the dimensions is even, and the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "NO" or "YES" for each test case, which matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the cases where both dimensions are odd and where one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- It also correctly handles the cases where at least one dimension is even, allowing for the formation of a different rectangle.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
