Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads two integers from user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial conditions regarding `a` and `b` being odd or even do not change their values after this code is executed, as the values are directly assigned from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
