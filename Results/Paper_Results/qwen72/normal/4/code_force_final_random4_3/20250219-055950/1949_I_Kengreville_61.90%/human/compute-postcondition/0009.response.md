Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[0]`, `visited[j]` is `True`, the sum of `r[i]` and `r[0]` squared is equal to the sum of `dx` squared and `dy` squared, `coef0[j]` is equal to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is equal to `-coef1[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The `dfs(j)` function call likely modifies the `visited` array, setting `visited[j]` to `True`.
- The values of `j`, `n`, `dx`, `dy`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain as specified in the initial state.
- The condition that the sum of `r[i]` and `r[0]` squared is equal to the sum of `dx` squared and `dy` squared is still valid.
- The values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated as specified in the initial state.
