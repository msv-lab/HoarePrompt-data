Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 1. `nodes` is a list with `n` elements, each element being an index from 0 to `n-1`. `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, with the index `i` starting from 0 and ending at `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if the element at index `i` in the `visited` list is `False`, it is set to `True`.
- The `coef0` list is updated such that the element at index `i` is set to 0.
- The `coef1` list is updated such that the element at index `i` is set to 1.
- The `nodes` list is populated with the index `i` for each iteration.
- The `ok` variable is set to `True` if `c1` is not 0 after processing the `nodes` list, which it always will be because `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`, and all elements in `coef1` are 1.
- The `c0` variable remains 0 because it is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes`, and all elements in `coef0` are 0.
- The `c1` variable is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`, which is `n` because all elements in `coef1` are 1 and there are `n` elements in `nodes`.

Thus, after all iterations, `visited` will be a list of `n` `True` values, `coef0` will be a list of `n` zeros, `coef1` will be a list of `n` ones, `nodes` will contain all indices from 0 to `n-1`, `ok` will be `True`, `c0` will be 0, and `c1` will be `n`.
