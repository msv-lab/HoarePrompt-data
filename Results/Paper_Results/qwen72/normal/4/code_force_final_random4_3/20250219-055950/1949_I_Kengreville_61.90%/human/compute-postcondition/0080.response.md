The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided context, it seems to operate with predefined variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. These variables are likely defined outside the function or within the function body. The function is expected to return a value or values based on the manipulation of these variables, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Since the output is not specified, I cannot accurately describe the return value. However, I can infer that the function might be designed to process a set of disks (defined by their centers and radii) and possibly return information about the disks, such as whether they have been visited, or some calculated coefficients.

Functionality: **The function operates with predefined variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. It likely processes a set of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), and may return information related to these disks, such as their visitation status or calculated coefficients.**
