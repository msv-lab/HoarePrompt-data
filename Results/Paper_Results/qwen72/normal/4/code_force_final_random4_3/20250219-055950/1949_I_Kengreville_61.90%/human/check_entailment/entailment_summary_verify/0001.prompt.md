You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the disk at index `i`. If the disk at index `i` has not been visited, it marks it as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list. For each other disk `j` that has not been visited and is exactly touching the disk at index `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`. The function modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and the `nodes` list, but does not change the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists. After the function concludes, the `visited` list will have `True` for all disks that are part of the same connected component as the disk at index `i`, and the `nodes` list will contain the indices of these visited disks in the order they were visited. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated to reflect the coefficients for the disks in the connected component.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and then initializes arrays to store the coordinates `x`, `y`, and radii `r` of the disks.
   - It also initializes arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of visited disks and coefficients for the linear equations.
   - The `nodes` list is used to store the indices of disks in the current connected component.

2. **Connected Components and DFS:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to identify connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - For each disk `i` that has not been visited, it starts a DFS from that disk.
   - During the DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the squared distance between their centers to the squared sum of their radii.
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the neighboring disk and continues the DFS.

3. **Coefficient Calculation:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the linear equation \( \text{new\_radius}_i = \text{coef0}_i + \text{coef1}_i \cdot \text{new\_radius}_0 \).
   - The program ensures that the sum of the coefficients `c1` for the current connected component is non-zero. If `c1` is zero, it means that the radii of the disks in the component cannot be changed to satisfy the conditions.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all connected components, the program checks if there is at least one component where `c1` is non-zero.
   - If such a component exists, it prints `YES`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the DFS Function:
- The DFS function correctly identifies disks that are tangent to each other.
- It updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk in the component.
- The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that the disks are tangent, not overlapping.

### Analysis of the Main Function:
- The main function correctly initializes all necessary variables and arrays.
- It iterates over all disks to ensure that each disk is part of a connected component.
- The final check for `c1 != 0` ensures that there is at least one component where the radii can be adjusted to decrease the total sum of radii.

### Potential Issues:
- **Global Variables:** The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used as global variables within the `dfs` function. This is generally not a good practice, but in this context, it does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Edge Cases:** The program assumes that the input is valid and within the specified constraints. It does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly, but this is not required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii decreases. The use of DFS to identify connected components and the coefficient calculation are appropriate for the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
