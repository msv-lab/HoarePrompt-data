The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `nodes`. For the loop to execute, `nodes` must have at least one element. Since `nodes` is currently an empty list, we need to ensure it contains at least one element. The variable `j` will be set to the first element of `nodes` when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`. `nodes` is a list with at least one element, `j` is the first element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0.**
