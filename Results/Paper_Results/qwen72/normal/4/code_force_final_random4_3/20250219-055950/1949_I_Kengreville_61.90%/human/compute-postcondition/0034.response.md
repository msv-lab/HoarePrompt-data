The code snippet `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on the condition `c1 != 0`. If `c1` is not zero, `ok` will be set to `True`. If `c1` is zero, `ok` will retain its previous value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000
- `i` is 0
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces
- `visited[0]` is `True`
- `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`
- `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`
- `nodes` contains all the indices that have been visited
- `j` is the last element in `nodes`
- `ok` might be `True` or `False` depending on the specific condition within the `dfs` function
- `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`
- `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`

Since `coef1[0]` is 1 and `visited[0]` is `True`, `c1` will be at least 1. Therefore, `c1 != 0` is always `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains all the indices that have been visited, `j` is the last element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`.**
