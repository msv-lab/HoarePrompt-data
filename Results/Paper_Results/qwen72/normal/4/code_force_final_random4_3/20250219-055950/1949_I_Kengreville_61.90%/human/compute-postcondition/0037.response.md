Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains the index `0`, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (which is 0), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is 1.**
