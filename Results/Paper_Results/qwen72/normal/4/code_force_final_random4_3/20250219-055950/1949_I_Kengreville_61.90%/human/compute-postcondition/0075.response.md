Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 1. `nodes` is a list with `n` elements, each element being an index from 0 to `n-1`. `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is `n`. Additionally, the condition `ok` is true.**
