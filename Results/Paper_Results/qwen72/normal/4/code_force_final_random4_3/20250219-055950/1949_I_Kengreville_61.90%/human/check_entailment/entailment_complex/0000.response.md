Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other.
2. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the input and storing the coordinates and radii of the disks.
2. Using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks.
3. Assigning coefficients to the disks in each connected component to check if the sum of radii can be strictly decreased without violating the tangency condition.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to keep track of the state of each disk.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The function `dfs` is called for each unvisited disk to explore its connected component.
   - For each disk `i`, it marks it as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list.
   - It then iterates through all other disks `j` to check if they are tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii).
   - If `j` is tangent to `i` and not visited, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on `j`.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - After the DFS traversal, the function `func_1` calculates the cumulative sums `c0` and `c1` for the `coef0` and `coef1` lists of the connected component.
   - If `c1` is non-zero, it means that the sum of radii in the connected component can be strictly decreased without violating the tangency condition, and `ok` is set to `True`.
   - If `ok` is `True` after processing all disks, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **DFS Traversal and Coefficients:**
   - The DFS traversal correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to check if the sum of radii can be decreased. However, the way `coef0` and `coef1` are updated is not entirely clear. Specifically, the update `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` should ensure that the sum of radii can be decreased without violating tangency. This update logic seems to be an attempt to balance the radii changes, but it is not straightforward to verify its correctness without further context.

2. **Cumulative Sum Check:**
   - The cumulative sum check `c1 != 0` is used to determine if the sum of radii can be strictly decreased. If `c1` is non-zero, it implies that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases. However, this check alone does not guarantee that the new radii will satisfy the tangency condition for all disks in the component.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where the initial radii are already the smallest possible positive real numbers (e.g., all radii are 1). In such cases, it might not be possible to decrease the sum of radii without violating the tangency condition.

### Conclusion:

While the program attempts to solve the problem using a DFS traversal and coefficient updates, the logic for updating the coefficients and the cumulative sum check is not robust enough to ensure the correctness of the solution in all cases. Specifically, the update logic for `coef0` and `coef1` and the cumulative sum check `c1 != 0` are not sufficient to guarantee that the new radii will maintain tangency and strictly decrease the sum of radii.

Therefore, the given program is not correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
