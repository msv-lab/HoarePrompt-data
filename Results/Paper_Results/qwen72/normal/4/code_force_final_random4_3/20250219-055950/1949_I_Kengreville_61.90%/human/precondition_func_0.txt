n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized to False, 0, and 1 respectively. nodes is an empty list.
