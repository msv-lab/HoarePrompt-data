Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[1]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[1]`, `visited[j]` is `False` or `True` depending on the previous iteration's condition. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, then `coef0[j]` is updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is updated to `-coef1[i]`, and the `dfs(j)` function has been called. Otherwise, `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.***
