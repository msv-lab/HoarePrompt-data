Output State: **i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, r, visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers or booleans, each of length n. The elements of x and y represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, and the elements of r represent the positive integer radii of the disks. The list visited now has the value `True` at index `i`, indicating that the disk at index `i` has been visited in the DFS traversal. The lists coef0 and coef1 are unchanged.**
