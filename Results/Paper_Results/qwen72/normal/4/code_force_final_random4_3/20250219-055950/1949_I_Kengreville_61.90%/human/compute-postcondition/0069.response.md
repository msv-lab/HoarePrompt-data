The value of `c0` is updated by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it. Since `j` is the third element in `nodes`, and `coef0` has the element at index 2 set to 0, the value of `coef0[j]` is 0. Therefore, `c0` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least three elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 2**
