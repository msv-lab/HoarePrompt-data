Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least `m` elements where `m` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (if `nodes` is not empty), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the sum of the first `m` elements of `coef1` (which is `m` because all the first `m` elements of `coef1` are 1).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged. The lists `coef0` and `coef1` also remain unchanged, with `coef0` having 0s at the first three indices and `None` elsewhere, and `coef1` having 1s at the first three indices and `None` elsewhere. The list `nodes` will have at least `m` elements, where `m` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `j` will be the last element in `nodes` if `nodes` is not empty. The variable `ok` remains `True`. The variable `c0` remains 0 because all elements in `coef0` are 0 or `None`. The variable `c1` will be the sum of the first `m` elements of `coef1`, which is simply `m` since each of these elements is 1.
