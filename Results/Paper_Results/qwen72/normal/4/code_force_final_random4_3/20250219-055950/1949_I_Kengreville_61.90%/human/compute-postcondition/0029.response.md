Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains at least one more element after `[0]`, `j` is the next element in `nodes`, `ok` might be `True` or `False` depending on the specific condition within the `dfs` function, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 1 + coef1[j].**

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` updates the value of `c1` by adding the value of `coef1[j]` to it. Given that `c1` was initially 1 and `coef1[j]` is 1 (since `j` is the next element in `nodes` and `coef1` is initialized with 1 at index `i` and `i` is 0, and `nodes` contains at least one more element after `[0]`), `c1` becomes 2. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
