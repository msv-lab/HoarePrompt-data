Postcondition: ***`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `j` is 0, and the element at index `j` of `d` is present in the slice of `e` starting from index `k`. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
