The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. The function outputs an integer `k` for each test case, which represents the index in `d` up to which all characters of `d` have been found in the corresponding positions of `e`, or the length of `d` if not all characters are found. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and their results printed.
