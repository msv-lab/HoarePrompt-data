Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` correctly. Specifically, it prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will print `9 1` instead of `1 9`.
