The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is the first integer from the new input. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, and `i` is 1. If `x` > `y`, `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.**
