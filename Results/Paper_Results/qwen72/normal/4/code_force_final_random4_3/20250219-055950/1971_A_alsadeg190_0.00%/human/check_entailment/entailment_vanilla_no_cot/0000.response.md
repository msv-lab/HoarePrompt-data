Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the output section. The problem description requires the output to be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the program prints the maximum followed by the minimum when `x > y`, and the minimum followed by the maximum when `x <= y`. This is the opposite of what is required.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

This corrected version will correctly output the minimum followed by the maximum for each test case.
