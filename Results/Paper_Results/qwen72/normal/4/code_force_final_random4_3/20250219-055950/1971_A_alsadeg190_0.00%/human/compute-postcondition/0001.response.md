The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `x` is an input integer between 0 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `x` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`x` is an input integer between 1 and 9, inclusive, `i` is 0**
