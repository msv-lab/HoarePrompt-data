Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1]`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- `i` remains 1.
- `s_a` is now increased by the value of `nums[1]`.
- `s_b` is still increased by the value of `nums[n - 1]` as it was in the initial state.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1.
