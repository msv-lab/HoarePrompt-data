The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer where 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9. The function returns one of two possible values:

- Case_1: If the function reaches a point where it returns `n`, it returns the value of `n`.
- Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns the number of times `s_a` was less than or equal to `a` plus the number of times `s_b` was less than or equal to `b` during the loop execution.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns `n` if a specific condition is met, otherwise it returns the sum of the number of times `s_a` was less than or equal to `a` and the number of times `s_b` was less than or equal to `b` during the loop execution.**
