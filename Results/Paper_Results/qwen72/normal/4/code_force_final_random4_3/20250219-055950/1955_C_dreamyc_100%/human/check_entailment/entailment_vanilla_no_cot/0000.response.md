Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sunk Ships**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of ships sunk by summing the durability of ships from the front and the back, and then comparing these sums to `a` and `b` (which are derived from `k`). However, this approach does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
   - The program incorrectly increments `ans` based on the sums of `s_a` and `s_b`, which does not reflect the actual number of ships sunk.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**:
   - The problem requires a simulation of the Kraken's attacks, where the first ship is attacked, then the last, and so on, until `k` attacks have been made or all ships have sunk.
   - The program does not simulate this attack pattern. Instead, it tries to use a mathematical approach that does not capture the alternating nature of the attacks.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is very large or when the number of ships is small.

To correctly solve the problem, a more appropriate approach would be to use a deque to simulate the attacks and keep track of the remaining ships. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = deque(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
                ans += 1
            k -= 1
        # Attack the last ship if k > 0
        if k > 0 and nums:
            if nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
                    ans += 1
                k -= 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program uses a deque to efficiently simulate the attacks on the first and last ships, and it correctly counts the number of ships sunk.
