Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining how many ships are sunk by the Kraken after `k` attacks. However, there are some issues with the logic in the function `func_1` that make the program incorrect:

1. **Sum Check**: The initial check `if (k >= sum(nums))` is correct. If the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the durability of all ships, all ships will sink, and the function correctly returns `n`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Sunk Ships**: The main issue is in the loop where the program attempts to count the number of ships sunk. The logic used to determine which ships are sunk is flawed:
   - The variables `a` and `b` are calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. This is intended to represent the number of attacks on the first and last ships, but the implementation is incorrect.
   - The loop iterates over all `n` ships, summing the durability of the first and last ships (`s_a` and `s_b`). However, the conditions `if s_a <= a` and `if s_b <= b` are not correctly identifying the ships that are sunk. These conditions are checking if the cumulative sum of the first and last ships' durability is less than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively, which does not accurately reflect the number of attacks each ship receives.

3. **Double Counting**: The loop can potentially double-count a ship if it is both the first and the last ship (i.e., when `n` is 1). This is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

4. **Incorrect Sinking Logic**: The program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks. It should keep track of the ships' durability and remove them from the list when they sink, but instead, it uses a cumulative sum approach that does not accurately model the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **False**
