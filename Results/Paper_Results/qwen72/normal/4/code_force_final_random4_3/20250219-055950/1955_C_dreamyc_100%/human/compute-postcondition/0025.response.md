Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 3]`. If `s_a` <= `a` and `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `s_a` <= `a` but `s_b` > `b`, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` increments `s_b` by the value of `nums[n - 3]` (since `i` is 2).
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- `s_a` is still increased by `nums[1] + nums[2]`.
- `s_b` is now increased by `nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 3]`.
- The conditions for updating `ans` remain the same: if `s_a` <= `a` and `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `s_a` <= `a` but `s_b` > `b`, `ans` remains unchanged.
