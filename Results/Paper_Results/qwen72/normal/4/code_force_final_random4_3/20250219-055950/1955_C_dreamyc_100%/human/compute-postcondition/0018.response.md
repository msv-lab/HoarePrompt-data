Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2]`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s_b` is updated by adding `nums[n - i - 1]` to it. Since `i` is 1, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2]`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s_a` is still increased by `nums[1]`.
- The value of `ans` is still determined by the condition that if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, `ans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
