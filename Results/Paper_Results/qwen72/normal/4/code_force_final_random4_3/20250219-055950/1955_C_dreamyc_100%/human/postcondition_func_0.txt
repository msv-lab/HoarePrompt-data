The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the value of `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the count of elements from the start and end of `nums` that, when summed, are less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. The final state of the program includes the return value, which is either `n` or a count based on the conditions described.
