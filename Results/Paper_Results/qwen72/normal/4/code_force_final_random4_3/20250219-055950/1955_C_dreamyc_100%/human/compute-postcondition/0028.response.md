Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 3]`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `s_a`, and `s_b` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if s_a <= a` is not checked in this snippet, so `ans` is always increased by 1 regardless of the value of `s_a` relative to `a`.
