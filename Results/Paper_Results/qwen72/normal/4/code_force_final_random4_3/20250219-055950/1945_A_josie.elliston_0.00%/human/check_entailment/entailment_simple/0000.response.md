### Reasoning:

1. **Introverts Handling**:
   - Each introvert must be in a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is simply `introverts`.

2. **Extroverts and Universals Handling**:
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. This means we need to ensure that we can form groups of three people for each extrovert.
   - The function `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It does this by checking if the total number of people (extroverts + universals) can be divided into groups of three.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means we have a remainder when dividing the number of extroverts by 3. We need to check if we have enough universals to fill these remaining spots to form complete groups of three. If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means we don't have enough universals to form the required groups, and the function returns `None` indicating an impossible scenario.
   - If `extroverts % 3 == 0` or if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`, the function returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - In `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`, the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is used to determine the total number of tents required. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means the accommodation is impossible, and `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the total number of tents is the sum of the tents required for introverts and the tents required for extroverts and universals.

### Verification with Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 2 more people to form a complete tent. We have 3 universals, so we can use 1 universal to form a complete tent with the 2 extroverts. The remaining 2 universals can form another tent.
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 4 more people to form complete tents. We only have 1 universal, which is not enough to form the required groups.
  - **Correct** (returns -1).

- **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 4 more people to form complete tents. We have 2 universals, which is enough to form one complete tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal. The remaining 2 extroverts and 1 universal can form another tent.
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 2 more people to form a complete tent. We only have 1 universal, which is not enough.
  - **Correct** (returns -1).

- **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
  - Introverts: 1 tent
  - Extroverts: 3 extroverts can form one complete tent. The remaining 2 universals can form another tent.
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
  - Introverts: 19 tents
  - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 7 more people to form complete tents. We have 18 universals, which is enough to form 2 complete tents with 6 extroverts and 6 universals. The remaining 1 extrovert and 12 universals can form 4 more tents.
  - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
  - No participants, so no tents are needed.
  - **Correct** (returns 0).

- **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
  - Introverts: 7 tents
  - No extroverts or universals, so no additional tents are needed.
  - **Correct** (returns 7).

- **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
  - No introverts or universals, so all 24 extroverts can form 8 complete tents.
  - **Correct** (returns 8).

- **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
  - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
  - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 1000000000 more people to form complete tents. We have 1000000000 universals, which is enough to form 333333333 complete tents with 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals.
  - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667
  - **Correct**.
