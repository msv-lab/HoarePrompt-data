You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Breaking Down the Solution:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we need `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need to ensure that the total number of people in these tents is a multiple of 3. If `b` (the number of extroverts) is not a multiple of 3, we need to use universals to make up the difference.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill in the gaps left by extroverts. If `b % 3` is not zero, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - If `b % 3 == 0` or there are enough universals, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`, which is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the result from `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `a`.
   - If there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `-1` if `b % 3 != 0` and `b // 3` otherwise.
   - If there are only universals (`a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`), the function correctly returns `ceil(c / 3)`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For a combination of introverts, extroverts, and universals, the function correctly checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and returns the minimum number of tents needed.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the edge cases, the provided program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
