### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Breaking Down the Solution:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we need `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need to ensure that the total number of people in these tents is a multiple of 3. If `b` (the number of extroverts) is not a multiple of 3, we need to use universals to make up the difference.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill in the gaps left by extroverts. If `b % 3` is not zero, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - If `b % 3 == 0` or there are enough universals, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`, which is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the result from `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `a`.
   - If there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `-1` if `b % 3 != 0` and `b // 3` otherwise.
   - If there are only universals (`a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`), the function correctly returns `ceil(c / 3)`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For a combination of introverts, extroverts, and universals, the function correctly checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and returns the minimum number of tents needed.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - **State Before Function Call:** `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= extroverts, universals <= 10^9`.
  - **Condition Check:** If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. If this condition is true, it returns `None` because there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.
  - **Return Statement:** If the condition is false or `extroverts % 3 == 0`, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - **Correctness:** The function correctly handles the case where `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. It also correctly calculates the number of tents needed when `extroverts` is divisible by 3 or when there are enough universals.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - **State Before Function Call:** `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= introverts, extroverts, universals <= 10^9`.
  - **Function Call:** It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - **Return Statement:** If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the result from `func_1`.
  - **Correctness:** The function correctly handles the case where `func_1` returns `None` and returns `-1`. It also correctly adds the number of tents needed for introverts to the result from `func_1`.
