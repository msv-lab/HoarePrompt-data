### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Breaking Down the Solution:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we need `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need to ensure that the total number of people in these tents is a multiple of 3. If `b` (the number of extroverts) is not a multiple of 3, we need to use universals to make up the difference.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill in the gaps left by extroverts. If `b % 3` is not zero, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - If `b % 3 == 0` or there are enough universals, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`, which is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the result from `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `a`.
   - If there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `-1` if `b % 3 != 0` and `b // 3` otherwise.
   - If there are only universals (`a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`), the function correctly returns `ceil(c / 3)`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For a combination of introverts, extroverts, and universals, the function correctly checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and returns the minimum number of tents needed.
