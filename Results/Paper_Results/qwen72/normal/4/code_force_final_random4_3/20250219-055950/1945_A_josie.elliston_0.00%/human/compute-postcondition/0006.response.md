The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers with a maximum value of 10^9. 

Case_1: If the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3 results in a quotient with no remainder (i.e., the sum is exactly divisible by 3), the function returns `None`.

Case_2: If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
