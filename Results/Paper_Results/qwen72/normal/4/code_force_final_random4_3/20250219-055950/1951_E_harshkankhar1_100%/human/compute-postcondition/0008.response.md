To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable will be iterated over the range from 1 to `n-1`. It starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable represents the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the range `range(1, n)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `x` is -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is True.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is -1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 1**
