Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^6\).
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `func_1(s[0:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
4. `i` is `n-1`. This means `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
5. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
6. `x` is the index of the first such character. The value of `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`.
7. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and values for variables, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints a constant string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the initial state of the program.

Output: **NO**
