You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward). If `s` is not a palindrome, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input string `s`.

            #- `s[0] = 'a'`.
            #- The first character from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]` is `s[2] = 'b'`.
            #- Therefore, `x = 2`.
            #- `s[:x + 2] = s[:4] = "aabb"`.
            #- `s[x + 2:] = s[4:] = "ccdd"`.
            #
            #### Final Output:
            #The `print` statement will output the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.
            #
            #Output:
        #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value as 1 or `n // 2`. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then `func_1(s[x + 1:])` remains False. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, and if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value as 1 or `n // 2`. If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, then `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and its length is between 1 and 1,000,000. It checks if the string `s` satisfies a condition defined by `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` is `False`, the function prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the string `s`, and then returns `None`. If `func_1(s)` is `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`. If no such character is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns nothing. If such a character is found at index `x`, the function checks if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. If it is `False`, the function prints 'YES' followed by '2', and then the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the function further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`). If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the function prints 'NO' and returns nothing. Otherwise, the function prints 'YES' followed by '2', and then the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle cases where the string is composed of the same character repeated multiple times, but the length is greater than 1. For example, for the input `s = "aa"`, the program will output `NO`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the string "aa" can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings, such as "a" and "a", but the program incorrectly concludes that no such partition exists. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the string has a length of 1, which should always return "NO" since a single-character string is a palindrome.
