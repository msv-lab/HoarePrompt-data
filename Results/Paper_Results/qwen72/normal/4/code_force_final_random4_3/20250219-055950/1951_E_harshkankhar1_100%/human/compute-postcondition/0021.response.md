Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. If any character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations:
- The string `s` remains unchanged and consists of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6.
- The length `n` of the string `s` remains unchanged.
- The function `func_1(s[0:])` is still True, as it was in the initial state.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- The variable `x` will be the index of the first character in `s` (from index 1 to `n-1`) that is not equal to the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`). If all characters from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `s[0]`, then `x` will remain -1.
