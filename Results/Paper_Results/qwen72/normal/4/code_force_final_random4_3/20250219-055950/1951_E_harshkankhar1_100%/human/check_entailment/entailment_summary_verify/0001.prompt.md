You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and its length is between 1 and 1,000,000. It checks if the string `s` satisfies a condition defined by `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` is `False`, the function prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the string `s`, and then returns `None`. If `func_1(s)` is `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`. If no such character is found, the function prints 'NO' and returns nothing. If such a character is found at index `x`, the function checks if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. If it is `False`, the function prints 'YES' followed by '2', and then the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the function further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`). If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the function prints 'NO' and returns nothing. Otherwise, the function prints 'YES' followed by '2', and then the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be considered a valid partition with one part.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it then tries to find a non-palindromic partition:
     - It iterates through the string to find the first character `s[i]` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
     - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index `i`.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, making it impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome:
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic by construction.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks:
     - If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot form a valid partition.
     - This is incorrect. The condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is not a valid criterion for determining if a partition is possible. For example, if `s = "abba"`, `x` would be 1, but the string can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings like "a" and "bba".
   - If the above conditions are not met, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This is also incorrect. The partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` is not guaranteed to be non-palindromic. For example, if `s = "abba"`, `x` would be 1, and the partition would be "abb" and "a", which is not valid.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the string is a palindrome but can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Specifically, the conditions `x == 1 or x == n // 2` and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are not valid criteria for determining the correctness of the partition.
