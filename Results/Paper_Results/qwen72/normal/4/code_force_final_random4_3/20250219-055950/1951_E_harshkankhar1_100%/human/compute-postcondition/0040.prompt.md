You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads a string `s` from the input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6)
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. If any character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: [s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the remaining substring of `s` starting from the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.
            #
            #Therefore, the final output is:
            #Output:
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement will print the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.
            #
            #### Example to Illustrate:
            #Suppose `s = "aabbccdd"`.
            #- `n = 8` (length of `s`).
            #- `s[0] = 'a'`.
            #- The first character from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]` is `s[2] = 'b'`.
            #- Therefore, `x = 2`.
            #- `s[:x + 2] = s[:4] = "aabb"`.
            #- `s[x + 2:] = s[4:] = "ccdd"`.
            #
            #### Final Output:
            #The `print` statement will output the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.
            #
            #Output:
        #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value as 1 or `n // 2`. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is `n-1`. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and `x` is the index of the first such character. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, then `func_1(s[x + 1:])` remains False. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, and if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, then `x` retains its value as 1 or `n // 2`. If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, then `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads a string `s` from the input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and its length is between 1 and 1,000,000. It either returns `None` or ends without returning any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `None`.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.
