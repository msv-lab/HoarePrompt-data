Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length `n` such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^6\).
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `func_1(s[0:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns True.
4. `i` is `n-1`. This means `i` is the last index of the string `s`.
5. There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
6. `x` is the index of the first such character. This means `x` is the smallest index greater than 0 where `s[x]` is not equal to `s[0]`.
7. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string returns True.
8. `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `x`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - Since `x` is not equal to 1, the first character that is not equal to `s[0]` must be at an index greater than 1.
   - Since `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, the index `x` must be different from the midpoint of the string.

2. **Substrings to be printed:**
   - `s[:x + 2]` is the substring of `s` from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.

### Example to Illustrate:
Suppose `s = "aabbccdd"`.
- `n = 8` (length of `s`).
- `s[0] = 'a'`.
- The first character from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]` is `s[2] = 'b'`.
- Therefore, `x = 2`.
- `s[:x + 2] = s[:4] = "aabb"`.
- `s[x + 2:] = s[4:] = "ccdd"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.

Output: **s[:x + 2] ' ' s[x + 2:] (where `s[:x + 2]` is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and `s[x + 2:]` is the substring starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of `s`)**.
