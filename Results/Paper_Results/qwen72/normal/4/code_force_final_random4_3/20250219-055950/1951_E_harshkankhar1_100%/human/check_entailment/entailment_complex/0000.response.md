### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - The function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by "1" and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s` and sets `x` to the index of this character.
   - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If such a character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by "2" and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`).
   - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES", followed by "2" and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` is a single character, `func_1(s)` will return `True` (since a single character is a palindrome), and `x` will remain -1, leading to the correct output "NO".
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same, `func_1(s)` will return `True`, and `x` will remain -1, leading to the correct output "NO".
   - **String with a Single Different Character**: If `s` has a single different character (e.g., "aaabaaa"), the function will correctly find `x` and check the remaining substrings to determine if a valid partition exists.

4. **General Case**:
   - For strings that are not palindromes, the function correctly prints "YES" and the entire string as a valid partition.
   - For palindromic strings, the function correctly identifies if a valid partition exists by finding the first different character and checking the remaining substrings.
