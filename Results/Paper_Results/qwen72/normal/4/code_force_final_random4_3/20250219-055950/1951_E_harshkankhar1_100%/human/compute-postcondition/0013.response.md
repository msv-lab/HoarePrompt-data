The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 2, `x` is -1**
