The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of the string `s` (which is `n`).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 3, `x` remains -1**
