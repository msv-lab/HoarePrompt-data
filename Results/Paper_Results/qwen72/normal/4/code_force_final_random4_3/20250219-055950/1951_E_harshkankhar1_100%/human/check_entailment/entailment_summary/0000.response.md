### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose accurately.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '1', and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the function searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`.
     - If no such character is found, the function prints 'NO' because all characters are the same, and any substring will be a palindrome.
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, the function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`, which is a valid partition.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the function further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`).
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the function prints 'NO' because it cannot find a valid partition.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'YES', '2', and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`, which is a valid partition.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` is a single character, `func_1(s)` will return `True` (since a single character is a palindrome). The function will then search for a different character, which will not be found, and correctly print 'NO'.
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same, `func_1(s)` will return `True`, and the function will not find a different character, correctly printing 'NO'.
   - **Mixed Characters**: If `s` contains mixed characters, the function will correctly identify the first different character and attempt to partition the string accordingly.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The function `func_2` has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description for all valid inputs. It correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output.

Correctness: **True**
