Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs; `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the array of previous nodes returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`; `_` is the second return value from the `bfs` function, which is not used; `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` and is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive. `path_ba` now includes `n` as its last element. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` and is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive. `path_ba` now includes `n` as its last element, and `n` has been appended to `path_ba`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-2]]` and is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive. `path_ba` now includes `n` as its second last element, and the new value of `n` as its last element. If the new value of `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
