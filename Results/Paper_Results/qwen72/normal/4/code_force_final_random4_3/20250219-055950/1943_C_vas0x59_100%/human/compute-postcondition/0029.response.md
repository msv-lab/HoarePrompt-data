Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive, but the current value of `n` is -1; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs; `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the array of previous nodes returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`; `_` is the second return value from the `bfs` function, which is not used; `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
