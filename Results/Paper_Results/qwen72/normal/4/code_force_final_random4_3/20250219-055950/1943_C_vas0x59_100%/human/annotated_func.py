    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the list `l` remains unchanged, and the function has provided the index of the largest integer in `l`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` for the tree, where `u2vs[u]` is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex `u`.

    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input, constructs an adjacency list for the tree, and finds the longest path in the tree. It then generates a list of operations based on the path length. If the path length is odd, it generates operations for the middle node and all nodes up to the middle. If the path length is even, it generates operations for the two middle nodes and all nodes up to the middle. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, and returns `None`.
