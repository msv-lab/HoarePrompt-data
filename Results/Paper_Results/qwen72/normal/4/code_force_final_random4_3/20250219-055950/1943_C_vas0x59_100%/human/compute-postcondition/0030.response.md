Postcondition: ***`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`, `path_ba`) retain their original values. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement, and all variables retain their original values.***
