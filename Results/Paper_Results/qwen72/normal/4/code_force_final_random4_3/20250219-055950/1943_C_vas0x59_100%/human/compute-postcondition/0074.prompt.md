You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` for the tree, where `u2vs[u]` is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex `u`.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs.

    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has terminated because it has reached the starting node `a`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2

        #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least `ci`. `i` is `ci`. `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`. `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]

The length of `path_ba` is even.
    #State: *`path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has terminated because it has reached the starting node `a`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is set to `ci`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci1`, `c2` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci2`, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` values from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is (L // 2) + 1 if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and L // 2 if the length of `path_ba` is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [c + 1] [i] for each tuple (c, i) in `ops`, where `c` and `i` are determined by the length of `path_ba` as described in the initial state
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input, constructs an adjacency list for the tree, and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
