To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list.
2. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has terminated because it has reached the starting node `a`.
3. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.
4. If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
   - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
   - `i` is set to `ci`.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`.
5. If the length of `path_ba` is even:
   - `ci1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1.
   - `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c1` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci1`.
   - `c2` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci2`.
   - `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` values from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, we use the odd case logic.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, we use the even case logic.

2. **Odd Length Case**:
   - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is `c` (the node at the middle index `ci`), and the second element ranges from 0 to `ci`.
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function to each tuple in `ops`, converting each tuple `(c, i)` to a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.
   - The `print` function prints each of these strings separated by a newline.

3. **Even Length Case**:
   - `ci1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1.
   - `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
   - `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
   - `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples where the first element is either `c1` or `c2`, and the second element is an odd number from 1 up to `i`.
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function to each tuple in `ops`, converting each tuple `(c, i)` to a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.
   - The `print` function prints each of these strings separated by a newline.

### Example Output Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the output:

#### Odd Length Example:
- `path_ba = [5, 3, 1]` (length is 3, which is odd)
- `ci = 1` (middle index)
- `ops = [(3, 0), (3, 1)]`
- The `map` function converts `ops` to `['4 0', '4 1']`.
- The `print` function will output:
  ```
  4 0
  4 1
  ```

#### Even Length Example:
- `path_ba = [6, 4, 2, 0]` (length is 4, which is even)
- `ci1 = 1` (half the length minus 1)
- `ci2 = 2` (half the length)
- `c1 = 4` (element at index `ci1`)
- `c2 = 2` (element at index `ci2`)
- `i = 1` (last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1 = 3 - 1 = 2`)
- `ops = [(4, 1), (2, 1)]`
- The `map` function converts `ops` to `['5 1', '3 1']`.
- The `print` function will output:
  ```
  5 1
  3 1
  ```

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a series of strings, each representing a tuple from `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and the second element unchanged, separated by newlines.

Output: **[c + 1] [i] for each tuple (c, i) in `ops`, where `c` and `i` are determined by the length of `path_ba` as described in the initial state**.
