Postcondition: ***`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` and is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive. `path_ba` now includes `n` as its last element. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.***
