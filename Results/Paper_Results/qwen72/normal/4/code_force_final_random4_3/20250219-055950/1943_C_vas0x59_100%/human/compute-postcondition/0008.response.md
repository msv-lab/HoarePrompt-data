The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive, and the loop has already executed once, so `n` is effectively decreased by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must now be between 3 and 2001, inclusive, but since `n` was originally between 2 and 2000, it must now be between 2 and 1999, inclusive.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1999, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` now contains `[u]` (in addition to any previous values); `u` is decreased by 1; `v` is decreased by 1**
