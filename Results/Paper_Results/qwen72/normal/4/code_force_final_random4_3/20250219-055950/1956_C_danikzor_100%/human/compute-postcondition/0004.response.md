Let's break down the print statement and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
   - The number of test cases `t` is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
   - The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
   - `i` starts at 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is the integer `i`, which starts at 1.
   - The `*range(n, 0, -1)` part unpacks a range of integers from `n` down to 1 (inclusive). This means it will print all integers from `n` to 1 in descending order.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The integer `2` will be printed first.
   - The integer `i` (which is 1) will be printed next.
   - Then, all integers from `n` down to 1 will be printed in descending order.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a sequence of integers starting with `2`, followed by `1`, and then the integers from `n` down to 1.

Output: **2, 1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1 (where n is the input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive)**
