### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is correct for the problem.
   - It also correctly outputs `2 * n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations.

3. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2n` operations, which is the maximum allowed.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation, setting the row `i` to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation, setting the column `i` to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

4. **Permutation Validity:**
   - The permutation used in both Type 1 and Type 2 operations is `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Matrix Sum Maximization:**
   - By setting each row and each column to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, the matrix is filled with the highest possible values, ensuring the maximum sum.
   - The sum of the matrix elements after these operations is indeed `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

6. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is correct for the problem. This formula ensures that the sum of all elements in the matrix is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, performs the required operations, and outputs the correct maximum sum and the number of operations. The operations are valid and within the allowed limit, and the matrix sum is maximized as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
