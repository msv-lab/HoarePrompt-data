Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The number of test cases `t` is also given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
