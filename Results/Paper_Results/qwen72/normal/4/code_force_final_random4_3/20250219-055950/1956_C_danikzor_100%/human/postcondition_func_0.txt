The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, where `n` is between 1 and 500 inclusive. It then prints two values: the first is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, and the second is `2 * n`. Following this, it prints a series of lines for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Each line consists of two parts: the first part is `1, i,` followed by a descending sequence of integers from `n` to 1, and the second part is `2, i,` followed by the same descending sequence. The function does not return any values; all output is printed to the console. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it processes only one test case per call.
