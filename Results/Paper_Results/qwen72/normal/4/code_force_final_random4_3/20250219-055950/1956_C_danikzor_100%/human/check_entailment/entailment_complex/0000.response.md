Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. However, the loop in the main part of the program is incorrect. It should be `for _ in range(t):` instead of `for t in range(t, 0, -1):` to ensure that `t` is not modified during the loop.

2. **Matrix Sum Calculation**: The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is correct for the problem's constraints. The maximum sum is indeed the sum of all elements from 1 to `n` repeated `n` times for each row and column, which is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.

3. **Operation Count**: The program prints `2 * n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations. This is correct because the program performs exactly `2n` operations (one type 1 and one type 2 operation for each row).

4. **Operation Execution**: The program performs the operations as described:
   - Type 1 operation: For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the row.
   - Type 2 operation: For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the column.

   This ensures that each row and each column contains the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is correct. It prints the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves in the required format.

However, the main loop in the program is incorrect. It should be:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This ensures that `t` is not modified during the loop and that the function `func_1()` is called the correct number of times.

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the loop in the main part. If we fix the loop, the program will be correct.

Correctness: **False**

If the loop is fixed, the program will be:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

In this case, the program would be correct.

Correctness: **True** (if the loop is fixed)
