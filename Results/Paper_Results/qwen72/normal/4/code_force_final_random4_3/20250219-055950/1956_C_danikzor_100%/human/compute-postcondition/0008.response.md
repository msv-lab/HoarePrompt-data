The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; the number of test cases `t` is still given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
