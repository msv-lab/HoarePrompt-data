Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; the number of test cases `t` is still given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 500,000. The loop will have printed two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, with the first line starting with `1` and the second line starting with `2`, followed by the numbers from `n` down to 1.
