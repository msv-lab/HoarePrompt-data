Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
- The number of test cases `t` is given, and it is also between 1 and 500, inclusive.
- The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 Â· 10^5.
- `i` starts at 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant integer value. It will always be printed as `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `i`**
   - `i` starts at 1. Since the initial state does not mention any changes to `i`, we assume it remains 1 for this execution.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(n, 0, -1)`**
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Example Execution:
- If `n` is 5, the `range(n, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The `print` statement will then print `1`, `i` (which is 1), and the unpacked sequence `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### General Case:
- For any given `n`, the `range(n, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.
- The `print` statement will print `1`, `i` (which is 1), and the unpacked sequence `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the constant `1`, the value of `i` (which is 1), and the sequence of integers from `n` down to 1.

Output: **1, 1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1 (where n is the input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive)**
