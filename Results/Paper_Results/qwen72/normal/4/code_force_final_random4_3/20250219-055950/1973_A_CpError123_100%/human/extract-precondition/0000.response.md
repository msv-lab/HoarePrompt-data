Precondition: **The function should accept three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def max_draws(p1, p2, p3):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **p1, p2, and p3 are integers such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.**
