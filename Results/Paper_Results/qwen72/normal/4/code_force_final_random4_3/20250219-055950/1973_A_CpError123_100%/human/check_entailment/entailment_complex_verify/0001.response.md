### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Reading Player Scores:**
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players, ensuring that \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

3. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates `x` as half of the total points: \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \). This is correct because it represents the total number of games played, which must be an integer and even.
   - It also calculates `y` as the sum of the two lowest scores: \( y = a + b \). This is correct because it represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred between the two lowest-scoring players.

5. **Determining the Result:**
   - The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the result. This is correct because:
     - `x` is the maximum number of games that could have been played.
     - `y` is the maximum number of draws that could have occurred between the two lowest-scoring players.
     - The minimum of these two values ensures that the number of draws does not exceed the number of games played.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No games were played, so no draws.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0 1 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Reason: One game occurred, and it ended in a draw.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: The total points (3) are odd, so the scores are invalid.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: Two games occurred, both ending in draws.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3 3 3`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: The total points (9) are odd, so the scores are invalid.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `3 4 5`
  - Output: `6`
  - Reason: Six games occurred, with three draws and three wins/losses.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1 1 10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: Two games occurred, both ending in draws, and the remaining points are distributed as wins/losses.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles edge cases where the total points are odd and prints `-1`.
  - It also handles cases where the total points are even and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.

- **Mathematical Validity:**
  - The sum of the scores being even is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid.
  - The calculation of `x` and `y` is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles the problem by ensuring the total points are even and calculating the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. It also handles invalid cases by printing `-1`.

Final: **True**
