Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Processing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players, which are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., `0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30`).

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total number of points in a series of chess games must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It also calculates `y` as `a + b`.
   - The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Correctness of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all draws were between the two players with the lowest scores (`a` and `b`).

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y` to ensure that the number of draws is feasible given the total number of games and the scores.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `(0, 0, 0)`, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the input `(0, 1, 1)`, the function correctly prints `1` because one draw could have occurred.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 1)`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 2)`, the function correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred.
   - For the input `(3, 3, 3)`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the input `(3, 4, 5)`, the function correctly prints `6` because six draws could have occurred.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the function correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred.

7. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic of the function is consistent with the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.
   - The function ensures that the number of draws is feasible and maximized within the constraints of the total number of games and the scores.

Correctness: **True**
