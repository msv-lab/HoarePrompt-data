The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
