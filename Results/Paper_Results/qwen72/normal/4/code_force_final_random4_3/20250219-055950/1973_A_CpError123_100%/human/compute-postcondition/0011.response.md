Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to integers provided by the user.
- The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The variables `x` and `y` are not modified by this code snippet, so they are not included in the output state.
