Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `x` is the integer result of `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`.**
