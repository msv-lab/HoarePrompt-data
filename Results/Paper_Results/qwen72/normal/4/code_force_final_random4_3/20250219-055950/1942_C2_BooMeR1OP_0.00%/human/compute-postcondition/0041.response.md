Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (including the gap between the last and first elements if `x > 1`), where each gap is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + n` if `i == x - 1` and `a[(i + 1) % x]` otherwise.**
