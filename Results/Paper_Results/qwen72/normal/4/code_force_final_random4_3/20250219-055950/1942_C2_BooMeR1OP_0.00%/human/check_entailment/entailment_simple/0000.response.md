### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called `t` times, corresponding to the number of test cases.
   - Inside `func_1`, the input is read correctly for each test case: `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, and `a` is a list of `x` chosen vertices.
   - The vertices are adjusted to be 0-indexed and then sorted, which is a valid and necessary step for further processing.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals. This is a correct starting point.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The loop iterates over the chosen vertices and checks if the next two vertices (modulo `n`) can form additional triangles.
   - The condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` ensures that the next vertex is not already chosen, but the one after it is. This correctly identifies additional triangles that can be formed without adding new vertices.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The gaps between consecutive chosen vertices are calculated and stored in a list `gaps`. This is done correctly by considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - The gaps are sorted, which is necessary for the next step of maximizing the number of triangles by adding the minimum number of vertices.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The loop iterates over the sorted gaps and calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added within each gap.
   - If `y` (the remaining vertices that can be chosen) is greater than or equal to the number of pairs, the gap is fully utilized to form additional triangles.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, the remaining `y` vertices are used to form the maximum possible triangles within the current gap, and the loop breaks.

6. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for each test case.
- The logic for calculating the initial number of triangles and then maximizing the number of triangles by adding additional vertices is sound and follows the problem constraints.
- The handling of gaps and the circular nature of the polygon is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Correctness: **True**
