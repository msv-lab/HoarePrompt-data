The only objects in the loop head are `gap` and `gaps`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` list. If `gaps` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in `gaps`.

At the end of the last iteration, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`, and `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `gaps` must have at least two elements, and `gap` must be the second element in `gaps`.

State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least two elements, `gap` is the second element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`**
