You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen and adjusts them to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each vertex.

2. **Initial Triangle Count:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the chosen vertices and checks if adding a vertex at `(a[i] + 1) % n` or `(a[i] + 2) % n` (if not already present) can form additional triangles.
   - If `t1` (which is `(a[i] + 1) % n`) is not in the set of chosen vertices and `t2` (which is `(a[i] + 2) % n`) is in the set, it increments the triangle count `ans` by 1.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices in a circular manner.
   - These gaps are stored in the list `gaps`.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The gaps are sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then iterates through these gaps and tries to add vertices to form more triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (i.e., `gap // 2`).
   - If the number of pairs is less than or equal to `y`, it adds the entire gap to the triangle count and decrements `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If the number of pairs is greater than `y`, it adds `2 * y` to the triangle count and breaks the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final count of triangles for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The initial triangle count `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles.
- The additional triangle check is also correct, as it ensures that adding a vertex at `(a[i] + 1) % n` can form a new triangle if the next vertex `(a[i] + 2) % n` is already chosen.
- The gap calculation and the subsequent addition of vertices to maximize the triangle count are logically sound. By sorting the gaps and adding vertices in the smallest gaps first, the program ensures that it maximizes the number of triangles without exceeding the limit `y`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out, given the constraints and the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
