Postcondition: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`, and `t1` is not in `present` while `t2` is in `present`.**
