Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x > 2`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`, if `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is 1, this becomes `next_elem - a[1] - 1`.
- If `x > 2`, `next_elem` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `gap` is `a[2] - a[1] - 1`.
- If `x <= 2`, `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`. Therefore, `gap` is `(a[1] + n) - a[1] - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.
- If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, `ans`, and `next_elem` remain unchanged.
