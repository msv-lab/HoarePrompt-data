Postcondition: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `y` is updated to `y - pairs`, and `ans` is updated to `x - 2 + count + gap`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, then `ans` is updated to `x - 2 + count + 2 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
