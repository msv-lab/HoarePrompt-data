Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (including the gap between the last and first elements if `x > 1`), where each gap is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + n` if `i == x - 1` and `a[(i + 1) % x]` otherwise.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `y` is updated to `y - pairs`, and `ans` is updated to `x - 2 + count + gap`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, then `ans` is updated to `x - 2 + count + 2 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least two elements, `gap` is the second element in `gaps`, `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`. If `y` >= `pairs`, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, and `y` is decreased by the value of `pairs`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least three elements, `gap` is the third element in `gaps`, `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`. If `y` >= `pairs`, `ans` is now `ans + gap`, and `y` is now `y - pairs`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
