Postcondition: ***`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `x > 3`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.***
