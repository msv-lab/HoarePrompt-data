Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `gaps` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `x > 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.** 

Explanation:
- The code calculates `next_elem` based on the current value of `i` and the length `x`.
- If `x > 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[1]` because `(i + 1) % x` is `1` when `i` is `0`.
- If `x == 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` because `i == x - 1` is true, and the expression `n if i == x - 1 else 0` evaluates to `n`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, `ans`, and `gaps` remain unchanged.
