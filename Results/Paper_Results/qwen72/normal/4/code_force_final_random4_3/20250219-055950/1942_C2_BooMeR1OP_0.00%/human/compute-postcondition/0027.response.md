Postcondition: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `gaps` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `x > 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `gap` is greater than 0.**
