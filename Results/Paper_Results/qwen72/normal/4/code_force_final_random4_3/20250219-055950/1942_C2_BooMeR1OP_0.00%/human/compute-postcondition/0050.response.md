Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count + 2 * y`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `y` is less than `pairs`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
