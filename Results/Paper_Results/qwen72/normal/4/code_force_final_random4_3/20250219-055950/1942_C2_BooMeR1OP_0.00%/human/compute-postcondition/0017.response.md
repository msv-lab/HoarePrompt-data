The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `x` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `x` must be greater than 2

State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is `x`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 1`.**
