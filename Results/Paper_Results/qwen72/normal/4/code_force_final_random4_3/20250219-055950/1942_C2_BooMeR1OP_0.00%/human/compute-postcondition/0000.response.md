Output State: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` chosen vertices. `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.**
