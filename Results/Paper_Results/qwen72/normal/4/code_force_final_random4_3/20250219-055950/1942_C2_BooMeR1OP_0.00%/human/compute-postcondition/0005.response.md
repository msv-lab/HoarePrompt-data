Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`.**

The code snippet `ans = x - 2` assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `present` remain unchanged. The new value of `ans` is `x - 2`.
