The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, but since the state already specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, this condition is already met. The variable `j` is initialized to `n` before the loop starts, but for the loop to execute, `j` should start at 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
