To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head step by step.

### Given State:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `sum` is `4j^2 + 10j + 8`
- `i` is `j` + 2
- `j` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is in the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). This means `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute again.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `j` + 2
   - `j` is `n`
   - Therefore, `i` is `n` + 2

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n` + 3.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` + 1.
   - Therefore, `n` + 3 must be less than or equal to `n` + 1, which is not possible unless `n` is adjusted.

5. **Adjusting `n`**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `n` + 3, the loop will not execute again unless `n` is increased.
   - However, the loop head does not allow us to adjust `n` directly. We can only adjust `i`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n` + 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` + 1, which is not possible with the current values.

### Adjusted State:
Since the loop head only allows us to adjust `i`, and the current value of `i` is `n` + 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n` + 3. The loop will not execute again because `n` + 3 is greater than `n` + 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is `4j^2 + 10j + 8`, `i` is `n` + 3, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
