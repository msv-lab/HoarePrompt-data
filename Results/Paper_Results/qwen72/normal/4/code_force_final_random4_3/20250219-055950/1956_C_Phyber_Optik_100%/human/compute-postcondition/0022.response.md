The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body and is incremented internally by the `range` function, we don't need to explicitly adjust it. However, `t` is decreased by 1 after each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the next iteration starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `i` is n + 1, `j` is n**
