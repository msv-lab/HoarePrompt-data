The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition that `j` must be less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure that `j` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
