Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1, `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t` - 1**

The code snippet `sum = 1` updates the value of `sum` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still `n` + 1, `j` is still `n`, `n` is still an input integer, and `t` is still `t` - 1.
