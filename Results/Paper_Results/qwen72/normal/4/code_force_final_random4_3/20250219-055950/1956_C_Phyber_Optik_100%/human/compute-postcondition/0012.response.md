The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but given the state, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute. The variable `j` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `n + 1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not in the loop head and does not affect the loop execution, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (this is in the loop head and must be adjusted to ensure the loop executes).
- `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n (this is not in the loop head and does not affect the loop execution, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is n + 1 (this is not in the loop head and does not affect the loop execution, so it remains unchanged).

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `j` must start at 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `i` is n + 1, `j` is 1**
