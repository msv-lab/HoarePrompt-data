Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since the matrix is \( n \times n \), the maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \), which simplifies to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \).
   - This formula is indeed incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Operations Output**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - For each row \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it sets the row \( n - j + 1 \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For each column \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it sets the column \( n - j + 1 \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Effectiveness of Operations**:
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This means that each element in the matrix will be one of the integers from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of the matrix will be maximized.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect, as it uses \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \) instead of \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - However, the operations themselves are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.
   - The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

Final: **False**

The program's sum calculation is incorrect, even though the operations it performs are correct and will achieve the maximum sum. The sum should be calculated as \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \). Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.
