Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning it will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Values:**
   - Since `n` must be at least 3, let's consider the minimum value of `n` which is 3.
   - For `n = 3`:
     - `n - 2` is `3 - 2`, which is `1`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.

5. **Output:**
   - For `n = 3`, the print statement will output: `2, 1, 1, 2, 3`.
   - For any other value of `n` (where `n >= 3`), the output will be: `2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 3)**
