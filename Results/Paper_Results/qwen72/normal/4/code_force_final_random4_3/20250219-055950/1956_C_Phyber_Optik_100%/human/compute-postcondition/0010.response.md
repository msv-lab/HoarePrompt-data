Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `i` is n + 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- The variable `n` must have been greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `sum` will be the sum of the initial value 1 and the series of terms calculated in the loop, where each term is `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`.
- The variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 2 to `n`, and the loop condition `i <= n` will no longer be true after the last iteration, so `i` will be `n + 1` when the loop exits.
