Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1, `i` is `j` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `sum` is reset to 1. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `j` + 1, `j` is `n`, and `n` is an input integer. These conditions are still valid after the code execution.
