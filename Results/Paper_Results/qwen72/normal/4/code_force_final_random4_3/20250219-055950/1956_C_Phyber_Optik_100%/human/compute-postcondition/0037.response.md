Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 1`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, let's consider a specific example to illustrate:

- If `n` is 2:
  - `n - 1` is 1.
  - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 3)`, which is `[1, 2]`.
  - The output will be: `1, 1, 1, 2`.

- If `n` is 3:
  - `n - 1` is 2.
  - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 4)`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The output will be: `1, 2, 1, 2, 3`.

- If `n` is 4:
  - `n - 1` is 3.
  - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 5)`, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - The output will be: `1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4`.

Therefore, the general form of the output is:

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2)**
