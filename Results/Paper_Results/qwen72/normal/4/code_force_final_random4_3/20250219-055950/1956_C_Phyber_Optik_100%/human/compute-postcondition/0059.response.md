Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. This will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Combining the Values:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 1`.
   - The subsequent values printed are all integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, let's consider the smallest possible value of `n`, which is 2.
   - For `n = 2`:
     - `n - 1` is `2 - 1`, which is `1`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 3)`, which is `[1, 2]`.
   - Therefore, the output for `n = 2` is: `2, 1, 1, 2`.

   - For a general `n` (where `n` is at least 2):
     - `n - 1` is `n - 1`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

Output: **2, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
