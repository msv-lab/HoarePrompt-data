Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `sum` is \( n^3 \).
- `i` is `n` + 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Print Statement:
```
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant integer value. It will always be printed as `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - `j` is given as 1.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual elements.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, `range(1, 3 + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`, and `*range(1, 3 + 1)` will unpack it to `1, 2, 3`.

### Final Output:
- The first element printed will be `2`.
- The second element printed will be `n`.
- The subsequent elements printed will be the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, n, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n)**
