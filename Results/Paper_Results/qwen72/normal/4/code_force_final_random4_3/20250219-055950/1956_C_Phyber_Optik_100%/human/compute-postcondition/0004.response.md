The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range defined by `2` to `n + 1`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. The variable `i` will start at 2, and `sum` being 1 does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1, `i` is 2**
