Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `k` is 0 or 1, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m` plus 2, and `b[j]` must be different from `a[i]` and `j` must be less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m` plus 2. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
