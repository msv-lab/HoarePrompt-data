Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `k` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i + 1]` or `j == m` is still valid, but now `j` is one step closer to either meeting this condition or reaching `m`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid.
- The value of `k` remains 2.
