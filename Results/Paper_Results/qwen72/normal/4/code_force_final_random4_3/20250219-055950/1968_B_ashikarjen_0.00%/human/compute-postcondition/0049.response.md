The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. 

- `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are binary strings.
- `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the inputs `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Assuming the function processes the binary strings `a` and `b` in some way related to their lengths `n` and `m`, and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, two binary strings `a` and `b`, and their respective lengths `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5). It processes the binary strings for each test case and returns a result for each test case. The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
