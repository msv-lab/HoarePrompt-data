The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, regardless of the state of the program (the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and the tuple `q`), the `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
