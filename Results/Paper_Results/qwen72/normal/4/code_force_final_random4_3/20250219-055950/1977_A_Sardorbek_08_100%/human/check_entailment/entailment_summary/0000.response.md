### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This case is correctly handled by printing 'YES'.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. This case is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to build a tower with `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even to maintain the same parity. This case is correctly handled by printing 'Yes'.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be odd to change the parity, which is not possible. This case is correctly handled by printing 'No'.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function prints the results in the correct format, either 'YES', 'Yes', or 'NO'. The problem description allows for any case (lowercase or uppercase) for the output, so the function's output is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
