Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers `b` and `c`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `b == c`, it means Nikita can simply put `c` cubes on the tower in `b` moves, so the answer is "YES".
   - If `b < c`, it means Nikita cannot have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves he has, so the answer is "NO".
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it means the parity of `b` and `c` is the same. This is a valid condition because Nikita can always end up with a tower of `c` cubes if the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity. For example, if `b` is odd and `c` is odd, or if `b` is even and `c` is even, it is possible to achieve the desired tower.
   - If `b % 2 != c % 2`, it means the parity of `b` and `c` is different, which means it is impossible to achieve the desired tower. For example, if `b` is odd and `c` is even, or if `b` is even and `c` is odd, the answer is "No".

The program correctly covers all these cases and outputs the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential input.
