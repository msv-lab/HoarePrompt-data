Output State: **`a` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The variables `b` and `c` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user.
- The initial state variables `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `a` and `i`, and the new values for `b` and `c` as input integers.
