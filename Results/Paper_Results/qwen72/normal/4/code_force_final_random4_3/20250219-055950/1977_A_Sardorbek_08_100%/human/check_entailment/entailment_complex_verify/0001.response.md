### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, then Nikita can simply add one cube in each move to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves. If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads `b` and `c` (which correspond to `n` and `m` in the problem description).
   - It checks the following conditions:
     - If `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'.
     - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (`b % 2 == c % 2`), it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is equal to `m`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` and checks the parity.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' in the correct format, which is acceptable according to the problem description.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func` does not take any parameters, which is consistent with the given code.
  - The function reads `a` (number of test cases) from the input.
  - For each test case, it reads `b` and `c` (which correspond to `n` and `m`).

- **State of the program during the loop:**
  - The tuple `q` is created but not used, which is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the program.
  - The conditions are checked in the correct order:
    - If `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'.
    - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
    - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it prints 'Yes'.
    - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

- **State of the program after the loop:**
  - The program has processed all `a` test cases and printed the corresponding results.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases, and the output format is correct.

Final: **True**
