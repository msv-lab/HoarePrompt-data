The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n, representing the edges of the tree.

The function returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree, which could be a specific configuration of the tree, a list of the remaining edges, or some other relevant output based on the removal of `k` edges.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a positive integer `k` (1 <= k < n) representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree. It returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree.**
