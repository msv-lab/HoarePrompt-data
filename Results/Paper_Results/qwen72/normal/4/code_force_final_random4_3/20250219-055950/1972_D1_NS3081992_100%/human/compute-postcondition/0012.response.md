Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were initially, within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6.
- The variable `i` will be the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i` is greater than `n + i`, whichever comes first.
- The variable `ans` will be the sum of the integer division `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the point where the loop condition fails (either `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`).
