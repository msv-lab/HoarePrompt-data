### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the implementation to understand why:

1. **Problem Description:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Function `func_15()`:**
   - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that \(i \cdot i > n + i\) or \(i > m\).
   - For each valid `i`, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Analysis of `func_15()`:**
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the way the answer is incremented `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the function `func_15()` does not compute the gcd or check the condition involving the gcd.
   - The logic in `func_15()` seems to be counting pairs based on a different, unrelated condition, which is why it does not solve the problem correctly.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct pairs are:
     - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
   - The function `func_15()` does not generate these pairs or check the gcd condition, so it will not return the correct count of 14.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
