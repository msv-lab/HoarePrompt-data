Correctness: **False**

**Reasoning:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The primary issue is that the function `func_15` is not implementing the logic required to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_15` is attempting to count the number of valid pairs, but it uses a loop that iterates over \(i\) and calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\). This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
import math
import sys

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

The provided program's `func_15` and `func_16` are not correct for the given problem, and thus the overall program is incorrect.
