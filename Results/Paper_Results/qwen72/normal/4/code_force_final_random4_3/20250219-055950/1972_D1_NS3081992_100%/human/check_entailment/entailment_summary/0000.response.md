### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`, which splits the input line into integers.

2. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16()` is the main function that processes the test cases. It calls `func_10()` to get the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_15()` for each test case and printing the result.

3. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`.
   - For each valid `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` does not directly address the problem's conditions. It calculates a sum based on a different formula, which does not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not checked in `func_15()`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic to find the valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem.
   - Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as specified.

### Correctness: **False**
