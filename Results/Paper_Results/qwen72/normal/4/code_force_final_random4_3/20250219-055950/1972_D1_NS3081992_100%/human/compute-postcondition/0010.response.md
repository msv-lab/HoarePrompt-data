Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its previous value. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `(n + 3) // 9` is added to `ans`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
