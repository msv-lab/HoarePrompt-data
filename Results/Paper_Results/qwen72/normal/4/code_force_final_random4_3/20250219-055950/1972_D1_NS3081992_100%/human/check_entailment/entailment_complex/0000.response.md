### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`.
   - `func_16()` iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.

2. **Function `func_15` Logic:**
   - `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`.
   - For each `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Correctness:**
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
   - This implies that `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15` uses a loop to count the number of valid pairs by checking the condition `(n + i) // (i * i)`, which is a simplified form of the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function `func_15` correctly handles the constraints `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`.
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` ensures that the loop does not run indefinitely and only considers valid `i` values.
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end of `func_15` is necessary to exclude the invalid pair `(1, 1)` which is counted in the loop.

5. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` and calculating the number of valid pairs.
   - The output is correctly formatted, with each result printed on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
