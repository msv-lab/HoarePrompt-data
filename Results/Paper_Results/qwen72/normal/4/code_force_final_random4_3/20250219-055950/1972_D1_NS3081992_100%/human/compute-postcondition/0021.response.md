Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()) and initially filled with zeros except `rank[da - 1]` which is now `tmp + 1`, `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all elements `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.
- All other variables (`d`, `processing`, `da`, `rank`, `tmp`) retain their initial properties and values, except for the specific change in `rank[da - 1]`.
