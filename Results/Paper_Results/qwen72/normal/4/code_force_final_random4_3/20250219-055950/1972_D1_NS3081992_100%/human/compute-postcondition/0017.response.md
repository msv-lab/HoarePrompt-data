Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()) with the element at index `di - 1` set to 1, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()) and initially filled with zeros, `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `di` is the third element of `d[da]`.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (1000000000) and the result of the function `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.
- All other variables (`d`, `processing`, `da`, `rank`, `di`) remain unchanged in their state and values as described in the initial state.
