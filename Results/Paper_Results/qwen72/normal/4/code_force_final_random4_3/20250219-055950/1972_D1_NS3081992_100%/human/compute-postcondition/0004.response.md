The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `func_10()`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than the value returned by `func_10()`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than the current value of `_`.

Given that `_` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must now be incremented by 1 again, and `func_10()` must still return a positive integer greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value of `func_15()` is printed followed by a newline.** 

To be more specific:
- `_` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1 again, so `_` is now `_ + 1`.
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than `_ + 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value of `func_15()` is printed followed by a newline.**
