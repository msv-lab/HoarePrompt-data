The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`. The loop can execute again if the return value of `func_10()` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder that represents the current iteration index, and `func_10()` must return a positive integer. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `func_10()` must still return a positive integer greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than the current value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1**
