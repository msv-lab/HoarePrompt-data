To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

1. `i <= m`
2. `i * i <= n + i`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i <= m`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than or equal to `m`.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Condition 2: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Substituting `i` with 3, we get: `3 * 3 <= n + 3`.
   - Simplifying, we get: `9 <= n + 3`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i` must both be satisfied. Given that `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 3, `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
