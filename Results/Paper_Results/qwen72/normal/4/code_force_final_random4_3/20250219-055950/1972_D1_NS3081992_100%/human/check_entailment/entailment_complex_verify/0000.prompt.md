You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, updating `processing` and `rank` accordingly. The function ultimately returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is one more than the minimum value returned by the recursive calls.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.

    #The program returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. `y` is the second value returned by `func_13`, `x - a // b * y` is calculated using the first value `x` returned by `func_13` and the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `g` is the third value returned by `func_13`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that if `b` is 0, the tuple is `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and returns a new tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, but the exact purpose and the final state of `x`, `y`, and `g` depend on the recursive calls and the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):

If `a[i]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[i])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), `m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, and `k` is updated based on the condition `a[i] < m` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[i])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns the value of a sum minus 1. The sum is calculated by iterating over integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7` and are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The sum is the result of adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each valid `i`.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on external functions `func_10` and `func_15` which are expected to return non-negative integers.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `func_10()` has returned a positive integer `n`, and `func_15()` has been called `n` times, printing `n` non-negative integers to the console, each followed by a newline.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It relies on two external functions, `func_10` and `func_15`. `func_10` is expected to return a non-negative integer `n`, and `func_15` is expected to return a non-negative integer each time it is called. The function prints `n` non-negative integers to the console, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` integers have been printed to the console, and the state of any external variables or functions used by `func_10` and `func_15` remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the problem requires counting ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 â‰¤ a â‰¤ n, 1 â‰¤ b â‰¤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the function `func_15()` does not seem to correctly handle the condition involving the gcd. Instead, it appears to be counting pairs based on a different logic, which is not aligned with the problem description. For example, the loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the way the answer is incremented `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not reflect the required condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
