The function `func_12` accepts the following parameters:
- `d`: a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers.
- `processing`: a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`.
- `da`: an integer key present in `d`.
- `rank`: a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`, initially filled with zeros.

The function returns:
- Case_1: The program returns 1.
- Case_2: The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all elements `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, plus one.**
