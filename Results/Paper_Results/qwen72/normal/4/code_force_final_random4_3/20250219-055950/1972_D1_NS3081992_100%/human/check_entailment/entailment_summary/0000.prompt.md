Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. The function does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program has an integer value that was read from the standard input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line from the standard input buffer, splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It then converts these integers into a list of integers and returns this list. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function concludes, the user will have a list of integers derived from the input line.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of the function `func_3()`. The specific value of each element depends on the implementation of `func_3()`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the next line of input from the standard input stream, with trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes it from bytes to a string. The function then returns this processed string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, where the input is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. The function then returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, they will cause a `ValueError` to be raised.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling the function `func_7()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list has been created and returned, with each element being the output of `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input being returned.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned the integer value provided by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings. Each string in the list is a part of the input provided by the user, split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing` of integers, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, updating `processing` and `rank` accordingly. The function ultimately returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is one more than the minimum value returned by the recursive calls.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that if `b` is 0, the tuple is `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and returns a new tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, but the exact purpose and the final state of `x`, `y`, and `g` depend on the recursive calls and the initial values of `a` and `b`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns the value of a sum minus 1. The sum is calculated by iterating over integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7` and are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The sum is the result of adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each valid `i`.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It relies on two external functions, `func_10` and `func_15`. `func_10` is expected to return a non-negative integer `n`, and `func_15` is expected to return a non-negative integer each time it is called. The function prints `n` non-negative integers to the console, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` integers have been printed to the console, and the state of any external variables or functions used by `func_10` and `func_15` remains unchanged.
