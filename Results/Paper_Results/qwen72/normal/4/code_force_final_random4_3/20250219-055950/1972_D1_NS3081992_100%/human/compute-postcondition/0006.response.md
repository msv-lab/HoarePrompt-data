Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `func_10()` has returned a positive integer `n`, and `func_15()` has been called `n` times, printing `n` non-negative integers to the console, each followed by a newline.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished running the number of times specified by the positive integer returned by `func_10()`. Each time the loop ran, it called `func_15()` and printed the resulting non-negative integer to the console, followed by a newline character. The placeholder variable `_` was used to control the loop but was not stored or used outside the loop.
