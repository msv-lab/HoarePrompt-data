### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and initializes an empty list `result` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculate Total Space Required**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`). These calculations are correct.
   - It also calculates the total space required for all icons (`total_space = space_y + space_x`), but this variable is not used in the subsequent logic, which is fine as long as the logic for determining the number of screens is correct.

4. **Determine Screens Required for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program correctly determines the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, one additional screen is needed.

5. **Calculate Remaining Cells**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons on the determined number of screens (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
   - This calculation is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

6. **Check if 1x1 Icons Fit in Remaining Cells**:
   - The program checks if the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells.
   - If they fit, it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If they do not fit, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the space that still needs to be filled.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` calculates the number of additional screens required. This is correct because if `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, one additional screen is needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The program then appends the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons to the result list.

7. **Output the Results**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line, using `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where `x` and `y` are zero. For example, if `x = 0` and `y = 0`, it correctly outputs `0`.
- It also handles cases where there are only 1x1 icons or only 2x2 icons. For example, if `x = 15` and `y = 0`, it correctly outputs `1`, and if `x = 0` and `y = 3`, it correctly outputs `2`.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is sound and correctly follows the problem description.
- It efficiently calculates the minimum number of screens required for both types of icons and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
