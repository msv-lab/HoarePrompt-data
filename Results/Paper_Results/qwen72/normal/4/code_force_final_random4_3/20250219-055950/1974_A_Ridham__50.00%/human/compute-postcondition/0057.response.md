To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `result` is a list that will contain the calculated number of screens required for each iteration.
- `x` and `y` are integers where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`.

### Iteration Logic:
For each iteration:
1. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is \( y // 2 \).
2. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is \( y // 2 + 1 \).
3. `remaining_cells` is calculated as \( 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y \).
4. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.
5. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated:
   - If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is \( x // 15 \).
   - If `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is \( (x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1 \).
6. The value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list, separated by newlines.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
Since the initial state does not specify the number of iterations or the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration, we need to consider the general logic for any given `x` and `y`.

1. **Even `y`**:
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( y // 2 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4) \)
   - If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, append `screen_require_for_y` to `result`.
   - Otherwise, calculate `extra_screen` and append `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to `result`.

2. **Odd `y`**:
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( y // 2 + 1 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4) \)
   - If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, append `screen_require_for_y` to `result`.
   - Otherwise, calculate `extra_screen` and append `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to `result`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider a few specific examples to illustrate the logic:

1. **Example 1: `x = 10`, `y = 4`**:
   - `y` is even.
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 4 // 2 = 2 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * 2 - (4 * 4) = 30 - 16 = 14 \)
   - `space_x` = 10 (which is less than or equal to 14)
   - Append `2` to `result`.

2. **Example 2: `x = 20`, `y = 5`**:
   - `y` is odd.
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 5 // 2 + 1 = 3 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * 3 - (5 * 4) = 45 - 20 = 25 \)
   - `space_x` = 20 (which is less than or equal to 25)
   - Append `3` to `result`.

3. **Example 3: `x = 20`, `y = 6`**:
   - `y` is even.
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 6 // 2 = 3 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * 3 - (6 * 4) = 45 - 24 = 21 \)
   - `space_x` = 20 (which is less than or equal to 21)
   - Append `3` to `result`.

4. **Example 4: `x = 30`, `y = 7`**:
   - `y` is odd.
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 7 // 2 + 1 = 4 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * 4 - (7 * 4) = 60 - 28 = 32 \)
   - `space_x` = 30 (which is less than or equal to 32)
   - Append `4` to `result`.

5. **Example 5: `x = 40`, `y = 8`**:
   - `y` is even.
   - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 8 // 2 = 4 \)
   - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 * 4 - (8 * 4) = 60 - 32 = 28 \)
   - `space_x` = 40 (which is greater than 28)
   - `extra_screen` = \( (40 - 28) // 15 + 1 = 12 // 15 + 1 = 1 \)
   - Append `4 + 1 = 5` to `result`.

### General Output:
The `result` list will contain the number of screens required for each iteration based on the given logic. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` for each iteration are not provided, the output will be a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each iteration.

### Final Output:
Output: **\n.join(map(str, result)) (where result is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each iteration based on the given logic)**
