Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, if `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`; otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15, `n` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers input by the user.
- `space_x` is updated to be equal to the new value of `x`.
- `space_y` is updated to be equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is updated to be equal to `x + y * 4`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is updated based on whether the new value of `y` is even or odd.
- `remaining_cells` is updated to be equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- The condition for updating `result` remains the same, but it is now based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells`.
- `n` is decremented by 1.
