You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers x and y as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `result` is a list containing the calculated number of screens required for each iteration. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. For each iteration, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated as `x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `(x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: \n.join(map(str, result)) (where result is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each iteration based on the given logic)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively. It returns the total number of icons on the screen, calculated as `x + 4*y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
