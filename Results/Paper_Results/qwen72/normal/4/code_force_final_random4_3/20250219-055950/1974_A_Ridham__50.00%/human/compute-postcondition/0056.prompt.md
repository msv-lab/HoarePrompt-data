Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, representing the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively. `n` is an input integer. `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if space_x % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = space_x // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as follows: if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` and `space_x` is not divisible by 15.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`, `screen_require_for_y` remains the same, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` <= `remaining_cells`, `result` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, and if `space_x` % 15 == 0, `extra_screen` is equal to `x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1`. The value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` has been appended to the list `result`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains an additional element equal to `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `x // 15` if `space_x % 15 == 0` or `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
