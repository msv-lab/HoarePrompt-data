Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`; otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15, `n` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `screen_require_for_y` is updated to `y // 2`.
- The values of `n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `remaining_cells` remain the same.
- The condition for `result` and `extra_screen` calculations remains unchanged.
- `n` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 1`.
