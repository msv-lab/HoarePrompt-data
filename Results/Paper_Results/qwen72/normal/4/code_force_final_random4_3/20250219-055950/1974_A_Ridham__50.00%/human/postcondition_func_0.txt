The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. These integers represent the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. The function calculates the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 15 cells (3x5 grid). The result for each test case is appended to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `result` on a new line. The final state of the program is that `n` is 0, `result` contains the calculated number of screens for each test case, and `x` and `y` are the last input values for the last test case.
