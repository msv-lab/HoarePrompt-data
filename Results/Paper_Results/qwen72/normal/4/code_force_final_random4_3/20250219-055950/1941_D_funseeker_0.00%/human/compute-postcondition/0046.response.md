Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`. `temp` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in `ans`. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `ans` will contain all the unique values that were generated by either adding `r` to each element `q` in the original `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`, or subtracting `r` from each element `q` in the original `ans` and taking the result modulo `n`, depending on the value of `c`. The set `temp` will be the final set of these unique values. The variables `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` will remain the same as they were in the initial state.
