To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that lead to the final value of `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, for all iterations of the loop.
- If `0` is in `ans`, the value `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
- `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- `_` is the final value of the range, which is `m - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial `ans` Set**:
   - The initial `ans` set is not explicitly defined, but it is constructed based on the values of `q` in the original `ans` set.
   - The values in `ans` are determined by the expressions `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates `m` times, with the loop variable `_` ranging from `0` to `m - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the set `ans` is updated by adding the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the current `ans`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - After the loop, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.

4. **Final `ans` Set**:
   - The final `ans` set will contain all unique values that were generated by the loop, with the condition that if `0` was present, it is replaced by `n`.

### Example Scenario:
To illustrate, let's assume some values for `n`, `m`, and `r`:
- Suppose `n = 5`, `m = 3`, and `r = 2`.
- Let's assume the initial `ans` set is `{1, 2, 3}`.

### Loop Execution:
1. **First Iteration (`_ = 0`)**:
   - `ans` is updated with `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `{1, 2, 3}`.
   - `(1 + 2) % 5 = 3`
   - `(1 - 2) % 5 = 4`
   - `(2 + 2) % 5 = 4`
   - `(2 - 2) % 5 = 0`
   - `(3 + 2) % 5 = 0`
   - `(3 - 2) % 5 = 1`
   - New `ans` set: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 0}`

2. **Second Iteration (`_ = 1`)**:
   - `ans` is updated again with `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `{1, 2, 3, 4, 0}`.
   - `(1 + 2) % 5 = 3`
   - `(1 - 2) % 5 = 4`
   - `(2 + 2) % 5 = 4`
   - `(2 - 2) % 5 = 0`
   - `(3 + 2) % 5 = 0`
   - `(3 - 2) % 5 = 1`
   - `(4 + 2) % 5 = 1`
   - `(4 - 2) % 5 = 2`
   - `(0 + 2) % 5 = 2`
   - `(0 - 2) % 5 = 3`
   - New `ans` set: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 0}` (no new unique values added)

3. **Third Iteration (`_ = 2`)**:
   - `ans` is updated again with `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `{1, 2, 3, 4, 0}`.
   - The same calculations as the second iteration will be performed, and the `ans` set will remain `{1, 2, 3, 4, 0}`.

### Final Condition Check:
- After the loop, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added.
- `ans` becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` (since `0` is removed and `5` is added).

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the final `ans` set, which contains all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` after the loop, with `0` replaced by `n` if `0` was present.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5 (where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are the unique values in the final `ans` set after the loop and condition check)**
