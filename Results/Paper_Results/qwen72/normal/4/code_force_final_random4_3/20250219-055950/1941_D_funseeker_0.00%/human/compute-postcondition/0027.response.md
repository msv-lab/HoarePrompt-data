Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, `_` is 1, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `r` is now explicitly an integer, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = int(r)` converts `r` to an integer.
- `r` was previously the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, so after the conversion, `r` remains the same integer value.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `_`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `m` must be greater than 1 and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?' is still valid.
- The set `ans` still contains the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`.
- The value of `_` remains 1.
