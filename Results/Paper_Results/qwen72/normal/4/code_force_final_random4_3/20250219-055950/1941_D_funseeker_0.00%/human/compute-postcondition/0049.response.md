Output State: **`r` and `c` are updated to the values returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in `ans`. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` updates the values of `r` and `c` to the values returned by `func_1().split()`. The function `func_1()` returns a string, which is then split into two parts, and these parts are assigned to `r` and `c` respectively. The other variables (`ans`, `temp`, `c`, `r`, `n`, `_`, and `m`) remain unchanged, and the conditions specified for `ans`, `temp`, `c`, `r`, `n`, `_`, and `m` still hold true.
