Output State: **`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least three elements, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and an additional `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the third element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The value `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, so after the code execution, `temp` will contain both values, with `(q + r) % n` appearing once more.
- If `c` is '0', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, so after the code execution, `temp` will contain `(q + r) % n` twice.
- `r`, `c`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- `m` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `q` remains the third element in `ans`.
