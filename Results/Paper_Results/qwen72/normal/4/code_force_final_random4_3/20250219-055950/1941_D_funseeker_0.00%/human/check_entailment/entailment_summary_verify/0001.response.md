### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which reads a line and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which reads a line and splits it into a list of integers.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1().split()`, where `func_1()` reads a line and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - This part of the input handling is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.
   - This initialization is correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - This logic is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue with the modulo operation when `q - r` is negative. The expression `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative value, which is not what we want. Instead, we should use `(q - r + n) % n` to ensure the result is always non-negative.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Indexing:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and a position of `0` should be adjusted to `n`.
   - This adjustment is correct and matches the problem description.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans`.
   - It then prints the players in the set `ans` in increasing order.
   - This output is correct and matches the problem description.

### Analysis of the Issue:
- **Modulo Operation for Counterclockwise Throws:**
  - The expression `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative value if `q - r` is negative. For example, if `q = 1` and `r = 2`, then `(1 - 2) % 5` would result in `-1 % 5`, which is `-1`. This is incorrect because we need the result to be a non-negative integer.
  - The correct expression to use is `(q - r + n) % n`, which ensures that the result is always non-negative. For example, `(1 - 2 + 5) % 5` would result in `4 % 5`, which is `4`.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is mostly correct, but it overlooked a potential issue with the modulo operation for counterclockwise throws.
- The program can be corrected by changing the expression `(q - r) % n` to `(q - r + n) % n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the potential issue with the modulo operation for counterclockwise throws. The corrected expression should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
