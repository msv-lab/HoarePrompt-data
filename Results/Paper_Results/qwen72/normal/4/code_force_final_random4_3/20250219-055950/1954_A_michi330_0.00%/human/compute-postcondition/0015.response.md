Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `itest` is 2.
- The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true if:
  - `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.
- Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is a simple string literal `'NO'`.
- The output of the `print` statement will always be `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, or `itest`.

### Explanation:
- The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is described in the initial state, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
