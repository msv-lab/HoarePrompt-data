The function `func` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be `def func(n, m, k):` where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
