Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `func` is not properly defined: This information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
   - `t` must be greater than 0: This is a condition that must be true, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement.
   - `itest` is 0: This is a variable, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers: These are variables that are provided as inputs.
   - `n` is greater than `k`: This is a condition that must be true.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`: This is another condition that must be true.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
   - The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the `print` statement directly. They are constraints that must be satisfied, but they do not change the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant string `'Yes'`, the output will always be `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as long as the conditions are satisfied.

Output: **Yes**
