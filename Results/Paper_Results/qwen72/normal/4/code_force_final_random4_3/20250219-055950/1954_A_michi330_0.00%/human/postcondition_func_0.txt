The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
