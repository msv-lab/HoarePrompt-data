### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - Alice wins if `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

4. **Explanation of the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:
     - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' (Bob wins).
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' (Alice wins).

5. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` gives the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color.
   - If this number is less than `k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `n <= k` correctly.
   - The code also handles the case where `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function Definition:**
  - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is correct for the given problem since the inputs are read inside the function.
  - The function reads `t` test cases and processes each one.

- **Input Reading:**
  - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.

- **Conditions:**
  - The condition `n <= k` is correctly identified as a case where Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
  - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is correctly identified as a case where Bob can still make all parts the same color even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.

- **Output:**
  - The code prints 'NO' if either of the conditions is true, and 'Yes' otherwise, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the logic are sound and cover all the necessary cases.

Final: **True**
