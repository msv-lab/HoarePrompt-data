Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `itest` is `t-1`, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'Yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop has run `t` times, and the variable `itest` is one less than `t` (i.e., `t-1`). For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are taken from the input, and the loop checks whether `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than `k`. If either of these conditions is true, 'NO' is printed for that iteration; otherwise, 'Yes' is printed. The function `func` is still not properly defined, and this does not change throughout the loop.
