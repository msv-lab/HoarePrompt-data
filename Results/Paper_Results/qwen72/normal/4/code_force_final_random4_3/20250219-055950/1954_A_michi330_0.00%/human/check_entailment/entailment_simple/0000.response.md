Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition Issue**: The function `func` is defined without parameters. According to the problem description, the function should take three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. The correct function definition should be `def func(n, m, k):`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each case.

3. **Logic for Determining the Output**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is used to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. The logic here is that if the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color (which is `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can achieve his goal.
   - Otherwise, the answer is 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Mathematical Consideration**:
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if Alice paints the ribbon optimally. This is because if Alice uses all `m` colors, the maximum number of parts with the same color is `math.ceil(n / m)`.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if Bob can repaint fewer than `k` parts to make all parts the same color. If this condition is true, Bob can win; otherwise, Alice can win.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints 'NO' or 'Yes' for each test case, adhering to the problem's output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct but has a minor issue with the function definition. However, since the function is not called with parameters in the provided code, the program still works as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The function definition should be corrected to `def func(n, m, k):` to match the problem requirements. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func(n, m, k):
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')

t = int(input())
for itest in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    func(n, m, k)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function `func` is properly defined and called with the correct parameters.
