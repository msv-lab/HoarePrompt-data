Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `counter` is 0, `i` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `i` is now explicitly set to 0.
