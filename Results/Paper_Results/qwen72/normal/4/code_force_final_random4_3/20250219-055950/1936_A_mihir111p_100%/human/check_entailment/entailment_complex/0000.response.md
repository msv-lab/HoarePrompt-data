### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, using at most \( 3n \) queries.
   - Each query involves four indices \( a, b, c, d \) and returns a comparison of \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index `ans1` such that \( (p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1}) \) is maximized.
   - Next, it initializes `mx` to 0 and a list `v` with a single element 0.
   - It iterates over the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) again to find indices `i` such that \( (p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1}) \) is less than or equal to \( (p_i \mid p_{ans1}) \).
   - It then iterates over the list `v` to find the index `ans` such that \( (p_{ans} \mid p_{ans}) \) is maximized.
   - Finally, it prints the result in the format `! [ans] [ans1]`.

3. **Query Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to make queries and return the comparison result.
   - The function correctly prints the query in the required format and reads the input.

4. **Finding Maximum XOR:**
   - The program uses the bitwise OR operation to indirectly find the maximum XOR.
   - The first loop finds an index `ans1` such that \( p_{ans1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop finds indices `i` that are candidates for the maximum XOR with `ans1`.
   - The third loop ensures that among the candidates, the one with the maximum value is chosen.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes at most \( 3n \) queries:
     - \( n-1 \) queries in the first loop.
     - \( n-1 \) queries in the second loop.
     - \( |v|-1 \) queries in the third loop, where \( |v| \) is the number of candidates, which is at most \( n \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will always find the maximum XOR of 1.
   - The program ensures that the indices are within the valid range \( 0 \le a, b, c, d < n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The query count is within the allowed limit, and the program handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
