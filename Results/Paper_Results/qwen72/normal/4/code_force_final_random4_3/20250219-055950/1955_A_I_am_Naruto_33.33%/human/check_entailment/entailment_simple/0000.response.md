Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

For each test case, the program calculates two potential costs:
1. `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
2. `ans2` is the cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, where `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotional price, and `n % 2` gives the number of yogurts that cannot be paired and must be bought at the regular price.

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs. If `n` is 1, it directly prints the regular price `a` because the promotional price does not apply.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

1. For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - The minimum is `9`, which is correct.

2. For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - The minimum is `14`, which is correct.

3. For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - The minimum is `15`, which is correct.

4. For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - The minimum is `20`, which is correct.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
