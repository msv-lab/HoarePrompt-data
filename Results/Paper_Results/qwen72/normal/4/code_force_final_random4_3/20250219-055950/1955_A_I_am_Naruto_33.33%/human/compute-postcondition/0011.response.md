Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`. If `n` ≤ 1, `ans1` and `ans2` are not yet assigned. If `n` > 1, `ans2` is not yet assigned.**
