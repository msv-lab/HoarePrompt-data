Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `a` is the second integer provided by the user input, `b` is the third integer provided by the user input. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` ≤ 1, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.**
