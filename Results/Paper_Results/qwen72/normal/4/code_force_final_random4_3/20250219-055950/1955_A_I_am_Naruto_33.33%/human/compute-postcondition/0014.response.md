Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user input for `t` is a positive integer.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `a` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `b` is an integer provided by the user input.
- If `n` > 1, `ans1` and `ans2` are not yet assigned.
- If `n` ≤ 1, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(a)` statement will print the value of the variable `a`.
- The value of `a` is provided by the user input, and it is an integer.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the value of `a`, which is an integer provided by the user input.

Output: **a (where a is the integer provided by the user input)**
