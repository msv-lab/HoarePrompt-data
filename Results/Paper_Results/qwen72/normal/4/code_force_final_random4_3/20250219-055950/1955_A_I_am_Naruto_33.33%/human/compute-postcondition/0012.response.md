Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`, `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans1` remains `a * n`.
- The placeholder `_` and the condition for `int(input())` and `t` remain unchanged.
