### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price. This is correct.

3. **General Case**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price: `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts (if any) are bought at the regular price:
       - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
       - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost for buying the remaining `n % 2` yogurts at the regular price.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Correctness of Calculation**:
   - The calculation `ans1 = a * n` is straightforward and correct.
   - The calculation `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is also correct:
     - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
     - `b * n // 2` gives the total cost for these pairs.
     - `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts (0 or 1), and `a * n % 2` gives the cost for these remaining yogurts.
     - Adding these two costs gives the total cost if Maxim uses the promotion as much as possible.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case, which is the correct approach to find the minimum cost.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `min(10, 9) = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 14) = 14`
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
  - Minimum cost: `min(15, 16) = 15`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22 + 0 = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `min(20, 22) = 20`
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The function summary and the original assessment are accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
