The only object in the loop head is the placeholder `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another input that is also greater than 0. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not a state variable but rather a variable used to discard the iteration count.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` ≤ 1, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.**
