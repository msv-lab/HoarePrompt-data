The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and `n` is equal to `k`. However, the `print` statement does not use `n` or `k` in any way; it simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
