The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. For the loop to execute, the list `costs` must have at least one element. Given the state before the loop starts, `costs` is defined as a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as `costs` has two elements.

However, to fully describe the state at the start of the first iteration, we need to specify the value of `i` and the state of `costs`:

- `i` will take the value of the first element in `costs` during the first iteration, which is `n - k + 1`.
- `costs` remains a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `h`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`**
