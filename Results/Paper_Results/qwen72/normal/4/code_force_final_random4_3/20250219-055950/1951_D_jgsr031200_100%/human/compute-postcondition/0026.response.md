Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `curr` is `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n` because any number divided by 1 is itself.
   - `h` is `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
   - `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Breaking Down the Initial State:**
   - `costs` is a list with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `curr` is simply `n`.
   - `h` is updated by adding two terms:
     - `n // (n - k + 1)`: This is the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1`.
     - `(n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`: This is the integer division of the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1` by 1, which simplifies to the remainder itself.
   - `n` is updated to `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`. Since any number modulo 1 is 0, `n` will be 0 after this operation.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the operations, `n` is 0.
   - `h` is updated to `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
     - Since `n` is 0, `n // (n - k + 1)` is 0.
     - Since `n` is 0, `n % (n - k + 1) // 1` is also 0.
     - Therefore, `h` remains `h` (unchanged).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
