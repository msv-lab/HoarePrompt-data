Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `curr` is `n // 1`.
- `h` is `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
- `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `costs`**:
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - To find the value of `n - k + 1`, we need to know the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Determine the value of `n` and `k`**:
   - The exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, but we can infer that `n` and `k` are integers.
   - The expression `n % (n - k + 1) % 1` will always result in 0 because any integer modulo 1 is 0. Therefore, `n` is 0.

3. **Substitute `n` into the expression for `costs`**:
   - Since `n` is 0, `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`.

4. **Determine the value of `h`**:
   - `h` is defined as `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
   - Since `n` is 0, `n // (n - k + 1)` is `0 // (1 - k)`, which is 0.
   - `n % (n - k + 1)` is `0 % (1 - k)`, which is 0.
   - `0 // 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is `h + 0 + 0`, which simplifies to `h`.

5. **Final value of `costs`**:
   - `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(*costs)
```
- The `*` operator unpacks the list `costs` into its elements.
- Therefore, the print statement will print the elements of `costs` separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 - k 1 (where k is the value of k)**

This output describes the values of the elements in the `costs` list, which are `1 - k` and `1`, respectively.
