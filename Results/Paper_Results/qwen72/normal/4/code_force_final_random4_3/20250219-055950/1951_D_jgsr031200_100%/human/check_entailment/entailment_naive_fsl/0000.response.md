Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only considers two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using these two stalls. However, this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios where Bob needs to set up more than two stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
n = 10
k = 3
```
According to the problem description, Bob needs to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. One valid solution could be:
```
YES
3
4 3 3
```
Here, Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall (10 // 4 = 2, 10 - 8 = 2 coins left), 1 jewel from the second stall (2 // 3 = 0, 2 coins left), and 1 jewel from the third stall (2 // 3 = 0, 2 coins left). However, the program will output:
```
YES
2
7 1
```
In this output, Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 7 = 1, 10 - 7 = 3 coins left) and 3 jewels from the second stall (3 // 1 = 3, 3 - 3 = 0 coins left), which results in Alice buying 4 jewels, not 3. This is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
