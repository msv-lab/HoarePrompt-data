Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is increased by 1. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, if the second character of `a` is not '0' or the first character of `b` is not '1', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
