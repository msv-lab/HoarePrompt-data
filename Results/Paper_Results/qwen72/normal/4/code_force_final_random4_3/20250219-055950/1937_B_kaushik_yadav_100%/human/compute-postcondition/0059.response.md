Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, `counter` is 1, `j` is 0. If the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in `b` is '1', the program continues with the current values of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is not '0' or the character at index `j` in `b` is not '1', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
