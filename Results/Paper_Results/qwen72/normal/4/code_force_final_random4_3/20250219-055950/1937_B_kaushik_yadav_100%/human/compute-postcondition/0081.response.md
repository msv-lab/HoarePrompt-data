Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` that match the corresponding characters in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]`, or 1 if the loop was reset due to a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop was broken if any character in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` did not match the corresponding character in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]` and was not a '0' followed by a '1'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains incremented by 1.
- The value of `t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
- The value of `a` remains a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters.
- The value of `b` remains a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters.
- The value of `ans` remains an empty string.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `work` is now True.
- The value of `j` remains `len(a) - 2`.
- The value of `counter` remains the number of consecutive characters from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` that match the corresponding characters in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]`, or 1 if the loop was reset due to a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop was broken if any character in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` did not match the corresponding character in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]` and was not a '0' followed by a '1'.
