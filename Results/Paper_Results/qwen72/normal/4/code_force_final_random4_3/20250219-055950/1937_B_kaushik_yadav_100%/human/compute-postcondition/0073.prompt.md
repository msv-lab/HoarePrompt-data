Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a non-empty string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, `counter` is 1 or 2, `j` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is 2. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is '0' and the character at index `j` in `b` is '1', the program continues with the current values of `a` and `b`. If the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is not '0' or the character at index `j` in `b` is not '1', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, and `j` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is set to 2 or 3. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. If `a[j + 1]` is not '0' or `b[j]` is not '1', `counter` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 3 characters. `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's conditions, and `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
