Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` if `work` is True and `b` if `work` is False, `i` is 0 if `work` is True and 1 if `work` is False, and `work` is False if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, `work` remains True, and if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, `i` is incremented to 1.***
