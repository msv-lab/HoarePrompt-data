Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings, each containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. `ans` is a string containing the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions until the loop terminates. `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is False, `j` is 1, and `counter` is 1 or 2. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `counter` is 2.**
