Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` if `work` is True and `b` if `work` is False, `i` is 0 if `work` is True and 1 if `work` is False, and `work` is False if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, `work` remains True, and if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, `i` is incremented to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 1. If `work` is True, and `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False. Otherwise, `i` is 2 if `i + 1` is not equal to `len(a)`, and `ans` is updated to include the second character of `b` if `work` is True or False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` if `work` was initially True and `b` if `work` was initially False, followed by the second character of `b`, and `i` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b` followed by the second character of `b`. If `work` is True, `ans` is extended by the third character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` remains 2 and `work` remains False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is further extended by the third character of `b`, `i` remains 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 3 and `work` remains False. If `work` is False, `ans` is extended by the third character of `b`, `i` is 3, and `work` remains False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
