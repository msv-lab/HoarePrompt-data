Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings, each containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False, followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` depending on the condition. If `work` is True, `i` is 1 or 2, and `j` is `len(a) - 2`. If `work` is False, `i` is 2, and `j` is `len(a) - 2`. `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` that match the corresponding characters in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]`, or 1 if the loop was reset due to a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop was broken if any character in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` did not match the corresponding character in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]` and was not a '0' followed by a '1'. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is extended by the character at index `i` of `a` and the character at index `i` of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is extended by the character at index `i` of `a`.**
