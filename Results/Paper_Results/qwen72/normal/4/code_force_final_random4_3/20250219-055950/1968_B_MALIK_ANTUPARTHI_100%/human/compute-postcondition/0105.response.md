Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5`. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The function returns the result of some operation on these binary strings for each test case, ensuring that the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**
