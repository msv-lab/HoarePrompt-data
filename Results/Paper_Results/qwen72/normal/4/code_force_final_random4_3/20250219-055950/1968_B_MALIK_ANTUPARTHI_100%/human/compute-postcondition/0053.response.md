Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 1, and `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.
- The initial value of `k` is 0.
- `d[j]` is the value of the second element in `d` (since `j` is 1).
- `e[k:]` is a slice of `e` starting from the first element (since `k` is 0).
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`.
- The new value of `k` is this index plus 1 plus the initial value of `k` (which is 0).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`) remain unchanged.
