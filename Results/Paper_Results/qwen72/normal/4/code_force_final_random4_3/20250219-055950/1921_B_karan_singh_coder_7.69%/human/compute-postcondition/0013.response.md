Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in the strings `s` and `t` differ. The loop index `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`) will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
