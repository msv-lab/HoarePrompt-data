### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s`, and the desired state `t`.

2. **Counting '1's:**
   - The function counts the number of '1's in both `s` and `t` using `s1 = s.count('1')` and `t1 = t.count('1')`. This is necessary to determine the number of cats in the initial and desired states.

3. **Counting Differing Positions:**
   - The function iterates through each box and counts the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ using `cnt += s[i] != t[i]`. This is a correct approach to find the total number of changes needed.

4. **Handling Equal Number of '1's:**
   - If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` is the same (`s1 == t1`), the function prints `s1` if `cnt` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0. This is incorrect because the number of operations required is simply the number of differing positions `cnt` when `s1` equals `t1`.

5. **Handling Different Number of '1's:**
   - If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` is different, the function calculates the absolute difference `d` between `s1` and `t1`.
   - It then calculates the number of operations as `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`. This is correct because:
     - `d` represents the number of operations needed to either add or remove cats to match the number of '1's.
     - `(cnt - d) // 2` represents the number of operations needed to move cats to the correct positions, as each move operation can fix two differing positions (one '1' to '0' and one '0' to '1').

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the case where the number of '1's in `s` and `t` is different.
- However, the function incorrectly handles the case where the number of '1's in `s` and `t` is the same. It should print `cnt` instead of `s1` if `cnt` is greater than 0.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = input()
        
        s1 = s.count('1')
        
        t1 = t.count('1')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            cnt += s[i] != t[i]
        
        if s1 == t1:
            print(cnt)  # Corrected: print the number of differing positions
        else:
            d = abs(s1 - t1)
            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
