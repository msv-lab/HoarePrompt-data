Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes; the second line contains a string s of n characters, each character being '0' or '1', representing the initial state of the boxes; the third line contains a string f of n characters, each character being '0' or '1', representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a new input integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, and `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a new input string, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, and `i` is `n`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
