The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is already set to `n-1`, which is appropriate for the loop to start from the last index if `n` is greater than 0. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0, not `n-1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0.

State: **`t` is a new input integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `t`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0**
