Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.***
