To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is `n-1`, but for the loop to start, `i` should be 0. 

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
