Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and it has exactly one element; `c` is 1, indicating that only one element greater than `x` was found in `a`; `i` is the last index of `a` because fewer than two elements greater than `x` were found. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list.**
