Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is an empty list, indicating that no elements in `a` are greater than `x`; `c` is 0, as no elements greater than `x` were found; `i` is undefined, as there are no elements greater than `x` to determine an index for.**
