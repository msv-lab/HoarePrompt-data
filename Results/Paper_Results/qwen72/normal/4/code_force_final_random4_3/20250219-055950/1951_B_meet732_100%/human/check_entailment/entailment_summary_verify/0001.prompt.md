You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of unique integers, where the length of the list `n` is between 2 and 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9. It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
- If no elements in `a` are greater than the element at index `k`, it returns `n - 1`.
- If the first element in `a` (index 0) is greater than the element at index `k` and it is the only such element, it returns `k - 1`.
- If the first element in `a` that is greater than the element at index `k` is at an index greater than `k`, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
- If the first element in `a` that is greater than the element at index `k` is at an index less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- If there are two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k`, and the first element is at index 0, it returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- If there are two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k`, and `k` is greater than the index of the second such element, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- If there are two elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to the index of the second such element, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches, where each match is between the cow in position `i+1` and the winner of the previous match.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win by either swapping its position with another cow once or doing nothing.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list of ratings `l`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It initializes `x` to the rating of cow `k` (adjusted by subtracting 1 from `k` to make it zero-indexed).
   - It initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of such higher-rated cows.
   - The function iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - Depending on the number of higher-rated cows found, it returns the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve:
     - If no higher-rated cows are found, cow `k` can win all `n-1` matches.
     - If one higher-rated cow is found:
       - If it is at index 0, cow `k` can win `k-1` matches.
       - If it is after cow `k`, cow `k` can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
       - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If two higher-rated cows are found:
       - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, cow `k` can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1` matches.
       - If cow `k` is after the second higher-rated cow, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
       - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` matches.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the indices of the first two cows with higher ratings than cow `k`.
   - It handles the cases where no higher-rated cows are found, one higher-rated cow is found, and two higher-rated cows are found.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is based on the positions of these higher-rated cows and the position of cow `k`.
   - The program correctly accounts for the possibility of swapping cow `k` to a position that maximizes its wins.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly handles all the edge cases and scenarios described in the problem statement.
