Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of unique integers, where the length of the list `n` is between 2 and 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns one of the following values based on the conditions:**

- **Case_1:** **If the list `a` has no elements greater than the first element, the function returns `n - 1`.**
- **Case_2:** **If the first element of the list `a` is greater than the second element, the function returns 0.**
- **Case_3:** **If the first element greater than the second element is at index `ind[0]` and `ind[0] > 1`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.**
- **Case_4:** **If the first element greater than the second element is at index `ind[0]` and `ind[0] <= 1`, the function returns the maximum value between `1 - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.**
- **Case_5:** **If the second element greater than the second element is at index `ind[1]`, the function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `1 - 1`.**
- **Case_6:** **If the first element greater than the second element is at index `ind[0]` and the second element greater than the second element is at index `ind[1]`, and the index of the second element `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.**
- **Case_7:** **If the first element greater than the second element is at index `ind[0]` and the index of the second element `k` is greater than `ind[0]` but less than or equal to `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
