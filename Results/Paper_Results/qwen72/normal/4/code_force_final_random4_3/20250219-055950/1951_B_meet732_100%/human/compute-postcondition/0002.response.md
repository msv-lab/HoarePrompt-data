Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `ind`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
