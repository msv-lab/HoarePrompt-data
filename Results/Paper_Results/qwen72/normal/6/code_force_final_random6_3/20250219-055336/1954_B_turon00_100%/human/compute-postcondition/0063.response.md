The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state, but it updates the value of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, if `n` is not 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, no further changes are made.**
