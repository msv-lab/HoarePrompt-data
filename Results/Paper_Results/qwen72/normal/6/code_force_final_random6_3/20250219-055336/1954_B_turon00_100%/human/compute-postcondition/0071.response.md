Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value (`n`) and the value of `cnt` (which is 0). Since `n` is a positive integer, the minimum value between `n` and 0 will always be 0. Therefore, `ans` is now 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
