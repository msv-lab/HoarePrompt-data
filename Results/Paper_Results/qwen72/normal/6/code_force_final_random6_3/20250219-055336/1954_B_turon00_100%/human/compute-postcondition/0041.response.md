Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` (which was equal to `n`) and `cnt` (which is 0).**

Since `cnt` is 0 and `ans` was initially equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` will be 0 if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0. Therefore, `ans` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
