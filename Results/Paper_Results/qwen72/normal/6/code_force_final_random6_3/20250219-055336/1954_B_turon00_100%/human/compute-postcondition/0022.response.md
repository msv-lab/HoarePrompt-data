Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the value of `cnt` to 0. Since `cnt` was previously 2 if `a[1]` was equal to `tmp`, or 0 otherwise, it is now explicitly set to 0. The value of `ans` is recalculated as the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, which is now 0 since `cnt` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
