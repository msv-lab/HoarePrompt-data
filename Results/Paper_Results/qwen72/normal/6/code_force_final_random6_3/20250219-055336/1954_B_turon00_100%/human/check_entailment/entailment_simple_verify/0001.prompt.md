You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 0, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - It also initializes `cnt` to 0, which will be used to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

3. **Loop through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array `a` using a for loop.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if it is equal to `tmp`.
     - If it is, it increments `cnt`.
     - If it is not, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - It then checks if `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n`.
     - If either condition is true, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
- A beautiful array can be made not beautiful by breaking the pattern of consecutive elements that can be replaced.
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive elements and finds the minimum length of these segments.
- However, the logic for determining if the array can be made not beautiful is flawed. The program only checks the length of the longest segment of consecutive elements, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made not beautiful.

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. According to the program:
- `tmp` is set to `1`.
- The segments of consecutive `1`s are `[1, 1, 1]` and `[1]`.
- The segments of consecutive `2`s are `[2, 2, 2]`.
- The program will output `3` (the length of the longest segment of `1`s or `2`s).

However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing any `2` will break the pattern and make the array not beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. It only considers the length of the longest segment of consecutive elements, which is not sufficient.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
