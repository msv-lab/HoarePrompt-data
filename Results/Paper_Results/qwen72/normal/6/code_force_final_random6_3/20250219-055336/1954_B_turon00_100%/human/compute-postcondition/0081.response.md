The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. We need to consider the initial conditions to determine the final values of `ans` and `cnt`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop
- `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`
- `i` is 2
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`
- Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0

Let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. **If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`**:
   - `cnt` is 2
   - `ans` is `n`
   - The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` will compare `n` and 2, and `ans` will be updated to the minimum of these two values.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, `min(n, 2)` will be 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or `n` if `n` is less than 2 (but `n` is greater than 1, so this case is not possible).
   - Therefore, `ans` will be 2.

2. **If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**:
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0
   - The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` will compare the minimum value between `n` and 0 with 0.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, the minimum value between `n` and 0 is 0.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be 0.

Output State:
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `ans` is 2.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is 0.
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop
- `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`
- `i` is 2
- `cnt` is either 2 or 0 (depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`)

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 0, `ans` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
