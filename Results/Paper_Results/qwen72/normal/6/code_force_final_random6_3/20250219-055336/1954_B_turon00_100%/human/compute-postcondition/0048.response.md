Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, and `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.***
