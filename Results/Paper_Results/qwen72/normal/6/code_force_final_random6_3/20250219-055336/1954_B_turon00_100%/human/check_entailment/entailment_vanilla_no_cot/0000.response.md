Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are a few issues:

1. **Logic for Determining the Minimum Removals**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`). However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the requirement that the array must stop being beautiful.
   - The problem requires that the array should no longer be beautiful after removing the minimum number of elements. The current logic only checks the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by outputting `-1` because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - However, the program also outputs `-1` if `ans == n`, which is incorrect. An array where all elements are the same can be made non-beautiful by removing one element, but the program incorrectly outputs `-1` in such cases.

3. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `ans` as the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
- Check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements from this subarray.
- If the array cannot be made non-beautiful, output `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest subarray where all elements are the same
        max_same = 0
        current_same = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i - 1]:
                current_same += 1
            else:
                max_same = max(max_same, current_same)
                current_same = 1
        max_same = max(max_same, current_same)
        
        # If the longest subarray is the entire array, check if it can be made non-beautiful
        if max_same == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest subarray
            print(max_same)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Edge Case for `n == 1`**: If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful, so we output `-1`.
- **Finding the Longest Subarray**: We iterate through the array to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
- **Checking if the Array Can Be Made Non-Beautiful**: If the longest subarray is the entire array, it means all elements are the same, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, we output `-1`.
- **Output the Minimum Removals**: If the longest subarray is not the entire array, the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is the length of the longest subarray.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all cases and outputs the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
