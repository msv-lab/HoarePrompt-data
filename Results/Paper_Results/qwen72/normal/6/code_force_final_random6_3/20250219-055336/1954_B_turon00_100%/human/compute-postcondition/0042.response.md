Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` (which was equal to `n`) and `cnt` (which is 0).**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt = 0` reassigns the value of `cnt` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `cnt` remains 0, and no other variables are affected. The initial state remains unchanged.
