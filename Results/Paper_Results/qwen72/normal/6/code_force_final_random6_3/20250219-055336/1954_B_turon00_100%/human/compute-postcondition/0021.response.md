Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- If `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2, and `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 2.
- If `a[1]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 0, which is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
