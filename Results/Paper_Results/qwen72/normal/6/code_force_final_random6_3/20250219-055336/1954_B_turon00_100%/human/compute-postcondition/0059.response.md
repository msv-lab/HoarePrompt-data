To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a` (since `i = n-1` and `n` is the length of the list).
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` starting from the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

3. **Logic of the Code:**
   - The code snippet provided only contains the `print(ans)` statement.
   - To understand what `ans` will be, we need to consider how `cnt` is calculated and how `ans` is updated.

4. **Calculation of `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` starting from the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`.
   - If the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be at least 1.
   - If the last element and the second-to-last element are both equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be at least 2, and so on.

5. **Update of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - Since `ans` is not equal to `n`, it must be some value that has been updated during the execution of the program.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the final value of `ans`, which is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between the previous ans and the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list a that are equal to a[0])**
