Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print the results. However, there is a logical error in the handling of the AM/PM designation and the hour conversion:

1. **AM/PM Designation**:
   - The program sets `day` to 'AM' initially.
   - If `h` is 0, it correctly sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it correctly sets `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
   - However, for hours between 1 and 11, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM'. This is a mistake because these hours should be 'AM'.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format for `h` equal to 0 and greater than 12.
   - For `h` equal to 12, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when it should be 'PM'.

Given these issues, the program will produce incorrect outputs for times between 01:00 and 11:59, and for 12:00 (which should be 'PM' but is set to 'AM').

Correctness: **False**
