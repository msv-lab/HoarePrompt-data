Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` using a binary search after performing at most 2 swaps to make the binary search effective. However, the program as written does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The binary search should be adjusted to find the position where `x` would be if the array were sorted. The current implementation of the binary search is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the case where `array[mid]` is equal to `find`. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly move the search boundaries.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not perform the necessary swaps to make the binary search effective. The problem statement requires that you can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search. The current program only checks if the binary search result `l` is equal to the index of `find` and prints the swap if necessary, but it does not actually perform the swap in the array.

3. **Output Format**: The program's output format is incorrect. According to the problem statement, for each test case, the first line should output the number of swaps `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 2), and the next `k` lines should output the indices of the elements to be swapped. However, the current program prints `1` or `0` directly within the function, which is not the correct format. The function should return a list of swaps, and the main loop should handle the printing.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases, but it does not ensure that the swaps are performed and the array is modified accordingly before the binary search is run.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
