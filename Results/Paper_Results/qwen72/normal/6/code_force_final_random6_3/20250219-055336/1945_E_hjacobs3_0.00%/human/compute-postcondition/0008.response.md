Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`n` - 1) // 2. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `r` is set to `mid` - 1. If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, `l` is set to `mid` + 1.***
