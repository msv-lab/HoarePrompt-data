### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to perform a binary search on the array.
   - The binary search loop is correctly implemented with the condition `while l <= r`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - The comparison `if array[mid] >= find` is used to adjust the search range:
     - If `array[mid] >= find`, it sets `r = mid - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `l = mid + 1`.

3. **Finding the Correct Position:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if the index `l` (which should be the position where `find` is located if the array were sorted) is equal to the actual index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap to correct the position.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints `0` and returns `None`.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` prints the number of operations (`0` or `1`) and returns the indices to swap if needed.

5. **Correctness of the Swap Logic:**
   - The program only swaps elements if the binary search does not find the correct position for `x`.
   - The swap is performed between the index `l` and the actual index of `x` in the array.
   - This ensures that `x` is moved to the correct position in the array, making the binary search work correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap to move `x` to the correct position.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
  - `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.

- **State After Binary Search Loop:**
  - `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`.
  - `r` is `l` - 1.

- **State After Swap Check:**
  - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, the program prints `1` and returns the indices to swap.
  - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, the program prints `0`.

### Issues Identified:
- **Binary Search Termination Condition:**
  - The binary search loop terminates when `r - l = 1`, but the condition used in the loop is `while l <= r`. This is correct because when `l` and `r` converge, the loop will terminate.

- **Index Off by One:**
  - The function `func_1` uses `l` and `r` as 0-based indices, but the problem description specifies 1-based indices. Therefore, when returning the indices to swap, the program correctly adds 1 to both `l` and the index of `find`.

- **Handling of `r` and `l` Initialization:**
  - The initialization of `l` and `r` as `0` and `n - 1` respectively is correct for a 0-based index array.

- **Correctness of Swap:**
  - The swap logic is correct. It ensures that `x` is moved to the correct position in the array, which is the smallest index where `array[l]` >= `find`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to perform a binary search and swap elements to ensure the search works correctly. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and performs the necessary operations to find the correct position of `x` in the permutation.

Final: **True**
