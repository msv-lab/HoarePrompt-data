Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2. If `array[mid]` >= `find`, `r` is updated to `mid` - 2. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid` + 1. In both cases, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.***
