### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to perform a binary search on the permutation.
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `n - 1` respectively, which are correct for a 0-indexed array.
   - The loop continues while `l <= r`.
   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, the search range is adjusted to the left half by setting `r = mid - 1`.
   - If `array[mid] < find`, the search range is adjusted to the right half by setting `l = mid + 1`.

3. **Final Check and Swap:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the elements at positions `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` to make the binary search work correctly.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints `0` and returns `None`.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop prints the number of operations and the indices for the swaps if any are needed.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly adjust the search range.
  - The loop should continue while `r - l > 1` to ensure the correct termination condition for binary search.

- **Output Format:**
  - The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices in the correct format.
  - The main loop should handle the output format correctly, including printing the number of operations and the indices.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(res[0])
        for i, j in res[1:]:
            print(i, j)
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        return [1, (str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1))]
    else:
        return None
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly handles the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the binary search works as intended.
- **False**: The original program has issues with the binary search implementation and the output format, making it incorrect.

Given the original program, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
