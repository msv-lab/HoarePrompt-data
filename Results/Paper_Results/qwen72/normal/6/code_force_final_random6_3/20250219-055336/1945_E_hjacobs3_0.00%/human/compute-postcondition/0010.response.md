Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` is `mid` + 1, `r` is `mid` - 1, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is recalculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.
- The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition `l` must be less than or equal to `r` is still valid.
