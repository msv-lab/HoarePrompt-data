Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
   - `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`.
   - `n` is the length of `array`.
   - `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`.
   - `r` is `l` - 1.
   - The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
   - The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
