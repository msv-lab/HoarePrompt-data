The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l <= r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the condition to be true.

Given that `n` is the length of `array` and `n` is at least 1 (since `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`), `r` will be at least 0. Therefore, the loop condition `l <= r` will be satisfied, and no adjustments are needed.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1**
