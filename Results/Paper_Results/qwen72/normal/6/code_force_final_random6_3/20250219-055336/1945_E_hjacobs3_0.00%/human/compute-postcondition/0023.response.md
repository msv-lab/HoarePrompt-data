Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, and `r` is `l` - 1. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.***
