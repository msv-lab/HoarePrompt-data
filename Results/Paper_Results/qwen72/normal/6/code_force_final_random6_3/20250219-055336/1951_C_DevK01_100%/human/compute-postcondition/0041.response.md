Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `M` is now a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns `M` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`) remain unchanged or are still defined by the initial state.
- The new value of `M` is a list of integers input by the user, replacing the previously sorted list of integers.
