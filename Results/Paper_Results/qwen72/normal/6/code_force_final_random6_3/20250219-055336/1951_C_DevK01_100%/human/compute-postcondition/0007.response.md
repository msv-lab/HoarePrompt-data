Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is equal to `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

Explanation: The value of `q` is calculated as the ceiling of the division of `k` by `m`. The ceiling function rounds the result up to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
