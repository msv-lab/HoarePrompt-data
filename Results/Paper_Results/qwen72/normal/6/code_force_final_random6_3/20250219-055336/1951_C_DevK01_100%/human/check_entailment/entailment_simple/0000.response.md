### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Initialization and Constraints:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the number of tickets bought per day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - This is a valid step because the maximum number of tickets you can buy per day should not exceed the total number of tickets required.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of prices `M` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given the constraint that you can buy at most `m` tickets per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought on the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days (i.e., `n * m`) is equal to `k`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase for subsequent days.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not equal to `k`, the program calculates the cost as follows:
     - It pops the last element `w` from `N` and calculates `mu` as `k - (n - 1) * m`, which is the number of tickets to be bought on the last day.
     - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` for the last day, plus the cost for the remaining days `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for the Last Day:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the last day. The additional cost due to the price increase should be applied to the remaining days, not just the last day.
  - Specifically, the line `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` is incorrect. The term `n * m * mu` should not be added to the cost.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:
- If `n * m == k`, the cost calculation is correct.
- If `n * m != k`, the correct cost calculation should be:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + mu * (w + (n - 1) * m)`

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect due to the flawed cost calculation for the last day.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
