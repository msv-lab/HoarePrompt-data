Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` or `q-1` elements of `M` depending on the condition, `cost` is calculated as described, and `w` and `mu` are set if `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `L`.
- This changes the value of `L` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, and `mu`) remain unchanged, but their values are now based on the new `L` list.
- The specific values of `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, and `mu` will depend on the new values in `L` and the subsequent calculations.
- The length of `N` (`n`) and the conditions for setting `w` and `mu` are still valid, but their specific values will be determined based on the new `L` list.
