Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cost` is assigned the value of `mu * w`.
- `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
