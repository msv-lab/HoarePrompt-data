Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a`. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and their respective minimum costs have been printed. **
