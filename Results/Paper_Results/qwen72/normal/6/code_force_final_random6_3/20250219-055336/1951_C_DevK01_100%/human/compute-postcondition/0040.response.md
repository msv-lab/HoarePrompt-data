The code snippet `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `L` by reading a line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and storing the result in `L`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is now the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is calculated as per the conditions given in the task.**
