To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the execution step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5\).
   - `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input.
   - `queries` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
   - `_` is incremented by `n` again.
   - `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

2. **Understanding the `result` Variable:**
   - The value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of this function.

3. **Understanding the `print(*result)` Statement:**
   - The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the elements of the `result` list and print them separated by spaces.

4. **Constraints and Implications:**
   - The condition `t > _` implies that after `_` is incremented by `n`, the value of `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
   - This condition is important for the context of the problem but does not directly affect the output of the `print` statement.

Given the initial state and the constraints, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **the elements of the list `result` separated by spaces (where `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`)**

This format captures the essence of the output without making assumptions about the specific values of `result` since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context.
