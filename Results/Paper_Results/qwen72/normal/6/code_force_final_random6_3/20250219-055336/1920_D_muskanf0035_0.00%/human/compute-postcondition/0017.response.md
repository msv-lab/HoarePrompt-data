Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n` again, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- `_` is incremented by `n` again, so the new value of `_` is the previous value of `_` plus `n`.
- The value of `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `result` is not known, but it is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
