Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input. `queries` is a list of integers.**
