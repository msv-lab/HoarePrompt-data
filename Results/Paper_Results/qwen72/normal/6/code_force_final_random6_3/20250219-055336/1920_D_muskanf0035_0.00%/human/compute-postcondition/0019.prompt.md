Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
    print(*result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input. `queries` is a list of integers. `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n`, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n` again, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
