### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries, storing them in lists `operations` and `queries`.

2. **Operation Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array.
   - It iterates through each operation in `operations`:
     - If the operation type is `1`, it appends the value to the `array`.
     - If the operation type is `2`, it appends `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is done by extending the `array` with a list comprehension that copies the current `array` `x` times.
   - This part of the function correctly simulates the operations as described in the problem statement.

3. **Query Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the results of the queries.
   - It iterates through each query `k` and appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list.
   - This part of the function correctly handles the queries by using the modulo operation to handle the repeated structure of the array.

4. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - The function prints the results of each test case, which are the elements at the specified indices in the `array`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Memory Efficiency:**
  - The current implementation of `func_1` can be inefficient in terms of memory usage, especially for large values of `x` in operation type `2`. The array can grow exponentially, which can lead to memory issues for large inputs.
  - However, the problem constraints guarantee that the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\), and the maximum value of `x` in operation type `2` is \(10^9\). This means that while the array can grow large, it is still within the bounds of the problem constraints.

- **Correctness of Queries:**
  - The use of `(k - 1) % len(array)` ensures that the query indices are correctly mapped to the elements in the array, even when the array is repeated multiple times.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the provided implementation, the program appears to be correct in terms of logic and handling the operations and queries as described. The potential memory issue is a concern for very large inputs, but it is not explicitly stated that the program must handle such inputs efficiently, only that it must be correct.
