The code snippet `n, q = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `q` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n` again, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. The new values of `n` and `q` are specific positive integers read from the input.**
