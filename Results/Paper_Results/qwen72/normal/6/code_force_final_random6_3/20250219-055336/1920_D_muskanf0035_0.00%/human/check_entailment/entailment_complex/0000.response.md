Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly processes the operations to build the array `a` based on the given operations.
   - For `op_type == 1`, it appends the integer `value` to the array.
   - For `op_type == 2`, it duplicates the current array `value` times. However, the code provided only duplicates the array once, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The correct implementation should duplicate the array `value` times.
   - After processing all operations, the function correctly handles the queries by using the modulo operation to find the correct element in the array, even if the array is very large.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The results from `func_1` are printed for each test case.

However, the critical issue is in `func_1` where the array duplication for `op_type == 2` is not implemented correctly. The current implementation only duplicates the array once, whereas it should duplicate the array `value` times. This can lead to incorrect results for large values of `value`.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the required behavior for the second type of operation.

Correctness: **False**
