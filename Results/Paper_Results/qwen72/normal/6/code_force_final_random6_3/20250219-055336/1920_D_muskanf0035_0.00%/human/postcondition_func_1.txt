The function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from the user. It first reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` (1 <= n, q <= 10^5), followed by `n` lists of integers (each representing an operation) and a list of `q` integers (representing queries). It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments, and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results of each test case have been printed.
