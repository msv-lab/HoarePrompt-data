Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to handle two types of operations on an initially empty array:
     - Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer queries about the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of queries).
   - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
   - It iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by appending `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After all operations, it processes each query by appending the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
   - Finally, it returns the result list.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array can grow very large, especially with operation type 2, which appends `x` copies of the current array. This can lead to memory issues and slow performance.
     - For example, if `x` is a large number (up to \(10^9\)), the array can become extremely large, which is not feasible to store in memory.
   - **Correctness of Query Handling:**
     - The query handling in `func_1` uses `(k - 1) % len(array)` to find the `k`-th element. This assumes that the array is cyclic, which is not always the case.
     - For large `x` values in operation type 2, the array length can exceed the query indices, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

5. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` will work for small inputs and simple cases, but it will fail for large inputs due to memory and performance issues.
   - The query handling is also incorrect for large `x` values in operation type 2, as it does not account for the actual size of the array after each operation.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
