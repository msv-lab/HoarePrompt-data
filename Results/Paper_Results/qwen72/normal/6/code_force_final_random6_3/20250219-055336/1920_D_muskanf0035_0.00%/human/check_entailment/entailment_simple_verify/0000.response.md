Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the second type of operation correctly. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` in `func_1` should append `x` copies of the array to itself, but it only appends one copy. This means that when the operation type is 2, the array is not being expanded as required by the problem description. 

For example, consider the input provided in the original assessment:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```
- After the first operation (1 1), the array is `[1]`.
- After the second operation (1 2), the array is `[1, 2]`.
- After the third operation (2 1), the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2]` because it appends 1 copy of `[1, 2]` to itself.
- After the fourth operation (1 3), the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
- After the fifth operation (2 3), the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` because it appends 3 copies of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` to itself.

However, the program will only append one copy in the fifth operation, resulting in:
```
[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
```
This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
