Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with `n` tuples, `array` is a list that contains the elements added by the operations in `operations` and possibly repeated based on the `op_type` values, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` repeated three times, `op_type` is the last tuple's `op_type` in `operations`, `value` is the last tuple's `value` in `operations`, `queries` is a non-empty list, `k` is the next element of `queries`**

Explanation:
- The code `result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])` appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` to the `result` list.
- Initially, `result` contained the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` repeated twice.
- After executing the code, `result` now contains the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` repeated three times.
- The values of `n`, `operations`, `array`, `op_type`, `value`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is still the next element of `queries`.
