The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

- `n` is a positive integer representing the initial length of the array.
- `operations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(op_type, value)` has `op_type` as an integer in {1, 2} and `value` as a positive integer. These tuples represent operations to be performed on the array.
- `queries` is a list of positive integers, where each integer `k` satisfies `1 <= k <= min(10^18, c)`, with `c` being the length of the array after all operations have been applied.

The function returns a list `result` which contains the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The elements in `array` are determined by the operations specified in the `operations` list, and the final `op_type` and `value` are from the last tuple in `operations`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple represents an operation on an array, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It returns a list `result` containing the elements at specific indices in the array, as determined by the operations and the queries.**
