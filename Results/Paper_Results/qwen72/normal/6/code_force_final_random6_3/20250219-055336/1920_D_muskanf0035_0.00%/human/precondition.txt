n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple (b, x) has b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q positive integers (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), with c being the size of the array after all operations.
