Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers from the input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n` again, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. The new values of `n` and `q` are specific positive integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]` reads `n` lines of input, each line containing integers separated by spaces, and stores these integers in a list of lists called `operations`.
- The variable `n` remains the same, and the variable `q` is not affected.
- The variable `t` is still an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- The variable `result` is still the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by `n` again, but its exact value is not specified, only that it is incremented by `n`.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds.
- The new values of `n` and `q` are still specific positive integers read from the input.
