Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
