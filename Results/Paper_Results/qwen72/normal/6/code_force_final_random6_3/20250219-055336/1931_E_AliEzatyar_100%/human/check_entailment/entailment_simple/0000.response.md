### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into a list of strings.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of each string.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the list `zeros` in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros to be subtracted by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list.
   - The idea is to simulate the optimal play where Anna can reverse the integers to minimize the number of trailing zeros, and Sasha can concatenate the integers to maximize the number of digits.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If this condition is met, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
   - This condition is based on the assumption that the game will end with a single integer, and Sasha wins if this integer has at least `m + 1` digits.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Misuse:**
  - The function `func_1` is designed to count trailing zeros in a string, but the program is passing individual elements of `array` (which are strings) to `func_1`. This is correct, but the function name `func_1` is not descriptive and could be misleading.
  - The function `func_1` should be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `count_trailing_zeros`.

- **Logical Flaw:**
  - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program assumes that the total number of digits minus the trailing zeros should be compared to `m + 1`, but this does not accurately reflect the game's rules.
  - The game's rules state that Sasha wins if the final integer is not less than \(10^m\). This means the final integer must have at least `m` digits, not `m + 1` digits.
  - The correct condition should be `if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m:` instead of `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:`.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has a logical flaw in the winning condition check. The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is incorrect and should be `if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m:`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if count_trailing_zeros(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(count_trailing_zeros(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def count_trailing_zeros(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
