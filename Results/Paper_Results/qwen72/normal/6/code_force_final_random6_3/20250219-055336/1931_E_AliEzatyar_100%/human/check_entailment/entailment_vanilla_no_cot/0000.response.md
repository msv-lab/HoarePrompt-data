Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, the logic of the game involves reversing the digits of the number, not just counting trailing zeros. The function `func_1` is not used correctly in the context of the game.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `subtract_zero`**:
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is calculated by summing the values of `func_1(item)` for every other element in the `zeros` list. This does not align with the game's rules. The game involves reversing digits and then concatenating, not subtracting the number of trailing zeros in a specific pattern.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Winning**:
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not a valid way to determine the winner. The game's outcome depends on the final number formed after all moves, not just the total number of digits minus some trailing zeros.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Move**: Anna reverses the digits of a number. This can potentially change the number of digits in the number.
- **Sasha's Move**: Sasha concatenates two numbers. The goal is to ensure that the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits.

The key to solving this problem is to understand that:

- If the total number of digits in the list is less than \(m + 1\), Anna will always win because Sasha cannot form a number with \(m\) or more digits.
- If the total number of digits is \(m + 1\) or more, Sasha can always win by strategically concatenating numbers to form a number with \(m\) or more digits.

### Corrected Program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = sum(len(item) for item in array)
    
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list and determines the winner based on the total number of digits compared to \(m + 1\).
