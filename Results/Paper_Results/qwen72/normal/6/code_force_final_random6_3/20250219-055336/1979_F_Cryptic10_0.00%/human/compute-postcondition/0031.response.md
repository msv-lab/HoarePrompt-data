To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```
This loop will iterate over the range starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of the range (`n - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the ending value (`-1`).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5
   - `d` is -1
   - `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set
   - `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop head is `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `n - 1` will always be at least 1, which is greater than `-1`. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once given the initial constraints on `n`.
   - The variable `d` needs to be adjusted to start from `n - 1` and decrement to `-1`.

4. **Final State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 (unchanged)
   - `d` is `n - 1` (adjusted to the starting value of the loop)
   - `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set (unchanged)
   - `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex (unchanged)

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex**
