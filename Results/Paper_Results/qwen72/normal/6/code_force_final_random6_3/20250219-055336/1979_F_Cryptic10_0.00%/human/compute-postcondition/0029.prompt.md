Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the graph; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or if `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
