Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes `v` from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is appended to the `path` list.
- The initial state mentioned that `path` includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. After appending `v`, `path` now includes `v`.
- The other variables (`n`, `d`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex remains valid.
- The current value of `v` is still in `remaining_vertices`.
