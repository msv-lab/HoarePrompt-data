The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices in a graph. The function returns a value based on the input `n`.

Since the output details are not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the given parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. It returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not specified in the provided information.**
