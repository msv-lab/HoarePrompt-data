The code snippet provided is:
```
print(a[i], end='')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and both must have at least one element.
- `i` is 0.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is called with `a[i]` as the argument.
2. `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
3. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added after the output, and the cursor will remain on the same line.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the list `a` without a newline character.

Output: **[first element of list a]**
