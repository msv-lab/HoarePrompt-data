Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `m`, and `b[0]` is updated to `n`. If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `n`, and `b[0]` is updated to `m`.***
