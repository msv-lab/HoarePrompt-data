Based on the initial state, we know that `a` and `b` are lists of characters with at least two elements, and `i` is 1. The `print` statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a` and will not add a newline at the end due to the `end=''` parameter.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. `a` is a list of characters with at least two elements.
2. `i` is 1.
3. The `print` statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.
4. The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is added after the printed element.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
