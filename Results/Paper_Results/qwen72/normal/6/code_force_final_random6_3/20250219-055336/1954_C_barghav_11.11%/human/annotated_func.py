#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. `b` has been fully iterated, and all its elements have been printed. `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two strings `a` and `b` from the user, where each string represents an integer of the same length and consists only of digits from 1 to 9. It then modifies `a` and `b` such that the first half of `a` contains the maximum values and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values of the corresponding elements from the original `a` and `b`. Conversely, the second half of `a` contains the minimum values and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values of the corresponding elements from the original `a` and `b`. After the modifications, the function prints the modified `a` and `b` as strings, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
