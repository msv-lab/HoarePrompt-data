Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters and handle multiple test cases. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def maximize_product(t, cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # cases is a list of tuples, each containing two strings x and y
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and cases is a list of length t, where each element is a tuple (x, y) with x and y being strings of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.**
