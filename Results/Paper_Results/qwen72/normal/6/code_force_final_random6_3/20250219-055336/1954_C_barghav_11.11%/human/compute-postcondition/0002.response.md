The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
