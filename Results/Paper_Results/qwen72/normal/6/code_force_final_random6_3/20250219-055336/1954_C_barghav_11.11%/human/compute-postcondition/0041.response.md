Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all iterations, the lists `a` and `b` have been modified such that the first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. Conversely, the second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. The loop variable `i` is equal to the index of the last element in `a` (which is `len(a) - 1`).
