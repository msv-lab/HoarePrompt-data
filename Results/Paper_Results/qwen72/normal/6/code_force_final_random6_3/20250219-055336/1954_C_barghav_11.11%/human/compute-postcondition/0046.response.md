Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
- The first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- The second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
- `b` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `b`**:
   - `b` is a list of characters.
   - The first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - The second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.

2. **Index `i`**:
   - `i` is 1, which means we are accessing the second element of the list `b`.

3. **Value at `b[i]`**:
   - Since `i` is 1, we are looking at the second element of `b`.
   - According to the initial state, the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - Therefore, `b[1]` is the minimum value between the second elements of the original `a` and `b`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `b[1]` without a newline at the end (due to `end=''`).

### Final Output:
Output: **b[1] (where b[1] is the minimum value between the second elements of the original a and b)**
