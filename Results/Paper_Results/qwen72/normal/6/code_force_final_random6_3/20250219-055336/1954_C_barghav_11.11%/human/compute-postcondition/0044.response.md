To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.
   - The first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - The first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - The second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - `b` must have at least 1 element.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Understanding the Lists**:
   - Since `i` is 0, the `print(b[i], end='')` statement will print the first element of the list `b`.
   - According to the initial state, the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
   - Therefore, `b[0]` will be the minimum value between the first elements of the original `a` and `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(b[i], end='')` statement will print the first element of `b`, which is the minimum value between the first elements of the original `a` and `b`.

Output: **b[0] (where b[0] is the minimum value between the first elements of the original a and b)**
