Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets, considering the constraints and the ticket hoarding measures described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current ticket price. This ensures that the tickets are bought at the minimum possible cost.

3. **Price Increase Mechanism**: The program correctly handles the price increase mechanism. Each time tickets are bought, the `price_increase` variable is updated, and the price of the ticket for the selected day is increased accordingly.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`. This is achieved by the line `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price of the ticket by the number of tickets bought on that day and adding it to `total_cost`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as:
   - When `k` is less than or equal to `m` (i.e., all tickets can be bought in one day).
   - When `k` is greater than `m` and tickets need to be bought over multiple days.
   - When the number of days `n` is 1.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
