To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `tickets_bought < k`. The variables involved in this condition are `tickets_bought` and `k`.

- `tickets_bought` is 0.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).

For the loop to execute, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is 0, the condition `tickets_bought < k` will be true as long as `k` is greater than 0. Given the constraints, `k` is always at least 1, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.

Therefore, the program state right before the loop is already sufficient to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap (a list of tuples where each tuple contains (price, index) for each price in the `prices` list, and the index is the position of the price in the `prices` list). `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
