Output State: **`total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets, `tickets_bought` is `k`, `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought, and `pq` is a heap with `n` elements reduced by the number of elements that have been popped.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`total_cost`**: This variable accumulates the total cost of buying `k` tickets. Each time the loop runs, it adds the cost of buying the current batch of tickets (determined by `tickets_to_buy`) at the current price (which is the smallest price in the heap plus the `price_increase`).
- **`tickets_bought`**: This variable tracks the total number of tickets bought. After the loop has executed all iterations, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, meaning all the tickets have been bought.
- **`price_increase`**: This variable keeps track of the total increase in the price of tickets due to the number of tickets bought. Each time tickets are bought, `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought (`tickets_to_buy`), so after the loop finishes, `price_increase` will be the total number of tickets bought.
- **`pq`**: This is the heap (priority queue) used to keep track of the prices and their corresponding days. After the loop has executed all iterations, `pq` will have fewer elements than it started with, specifically, it will have `n` elements reduced by the number of elements that were popped during the loop execution. The remaining elements in `pq` will still be a valid heap, but they will represent the prices and days that were not used to buy tickets.
