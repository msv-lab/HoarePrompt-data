Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` before the operation.**
