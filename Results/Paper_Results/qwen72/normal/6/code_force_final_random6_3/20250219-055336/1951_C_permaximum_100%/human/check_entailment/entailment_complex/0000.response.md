Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, with the constraint that a maximum of `m` tickets can be bought per day, and the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets bought on any previous day. The approach taken by the program is to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day, while keeping track of the total price increase due to tickets bought.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` (the number of days, the maximum tickets per day, and the total tickets needed), and the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day. This ensures that the heap is sorted by the ticket prices.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a while loop to buy tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`. In each iteration:
   - It pops the cheapest ticket price from the heap.
   - It increases the price by the total number of tickets bought so far (`price_increase`).
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
   - It updates the total number of tickets bought and the price increase accordingly.

4. **Heap State**: The heap is correctly maintained such that it always contains the remaining days with their updated prices. The heap is reduced by the number of elements that have been popped, and the prices are adjusted based on the tickets bought.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the total cost for each test case.

However, there is a subtle issue with the way the price increase is applied. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days, not just the current day. The current implementation only increases the price of the day being considered, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the price increase should be applied to all days in the heap, not just the current one. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate variable for the price increase and applying it to the price of each day when it is popped from the heap.

Given the current implementation, the price increase is not correctly applied to all subsequent days, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

To correct the program, you would need to adjust the price increase logic to ensure it is applied to all subsequent days. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import heapq

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # Apply the price increase to the current day's price
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        # Increase the price for all subsequent days
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    return total_cost
```

This corrected version ensures that the price increase is applied to all subsequent days, making the program correct.
