Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap (a list of tuples where each tuple contains (price, index) for each price in the `prices` list, and the index is the position of the price in the `prices` list). `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` before the operation.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `tickets_to_buy`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy` plus the previous `total_cost`. `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `price`, `day`, `total_cost`, and `tickets_bought` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
