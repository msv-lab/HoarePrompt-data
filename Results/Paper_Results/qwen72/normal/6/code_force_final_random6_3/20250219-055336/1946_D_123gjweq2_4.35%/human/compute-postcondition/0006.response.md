The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `i` will take the value of the first element in `cur_arr`.

To ensure the loop executes, `cur_arr` must have at least one element. The state of `i` is not something we need to explicitly set, as it will be assigned by the loop from the elements of `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
