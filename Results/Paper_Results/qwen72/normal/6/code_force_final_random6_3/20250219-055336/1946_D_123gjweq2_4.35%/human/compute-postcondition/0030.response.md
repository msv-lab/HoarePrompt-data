Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with any number of elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation, `xor` is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. Additionally, the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0.***
