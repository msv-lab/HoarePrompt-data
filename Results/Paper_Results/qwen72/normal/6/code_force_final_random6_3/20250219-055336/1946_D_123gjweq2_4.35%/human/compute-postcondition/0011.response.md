Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0.***
