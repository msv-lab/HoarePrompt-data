Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, and `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `xor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `i`.
- The value of `i` remains the second element in `cur_arr`.
- The value of `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.
- The value of `new_arr` is determined by the bit at position `bit` in the new value of `xor`.
- The value of `thing1` remains 0.
