The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor` if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is an empty list. `xor` is 0 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, otherwise `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`. `thing1` is 0.**
