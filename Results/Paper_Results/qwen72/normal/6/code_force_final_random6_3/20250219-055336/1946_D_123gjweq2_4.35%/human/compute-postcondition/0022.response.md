Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with any number of elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`cur_arr`**: The loop iterates over all elements in `cur_arr`, so the state of `cur_arr` remains unchanged.
- **`bit`**: The value of `bit` is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`new_arr`**: After the loop completes, `new_arr` will contain the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation. This means that if the bit at position `bit` in the cumulative XOR value was 0 after each iteration, the current cumulative XOR value was appended to `new_arr` and then reset to 0.
- **`xor`**: The loop resets `xor` to 0 each time the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, so after the loop completes, `xor` will be 0.
- **`thing1`**: The variable `thing1` is not modified within the loop, so it remains 0.
