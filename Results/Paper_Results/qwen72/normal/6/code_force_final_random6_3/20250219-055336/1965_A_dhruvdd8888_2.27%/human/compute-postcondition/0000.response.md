Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `N` is now assigned the value of an integer input by the user.
