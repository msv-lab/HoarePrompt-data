Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers with a 0 inserted at the beginning and has at least 3 elements, `cd` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
