You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and piles is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers converted from the set of unique strings from the input. The length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers converted from the set of unique strings from the input. The length of `nums` is greater than 1, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers with a 0 inserted at the beginning and has at least 2 elements, `i` is the index of the last element in `nums` that was checked (i.e., `len(nums) - 2`), `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that have a difference of 1, starting from the first element (0) up to the point where the difference is not 1 or the loop ends.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on some internal logic related to the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `piles`, and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
