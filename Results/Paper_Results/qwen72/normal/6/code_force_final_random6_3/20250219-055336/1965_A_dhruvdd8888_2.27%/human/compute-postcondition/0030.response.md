The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the context of the parameter constraints and the output cases, it is implied that the function likely operates on some global variables or inputs provided outside the function signature, such as `t`, `n`, and `piles`.

The function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on some internal logic or conditions and returns `None` in all cases. The specific conditions that determine whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed are not provided in the function signature, but they are likely related to the values of `t`, `n`, and the elements in the list `piles`.

Functionality: **The function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on some internal logic related to the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `piles`, and returns `None`.**
