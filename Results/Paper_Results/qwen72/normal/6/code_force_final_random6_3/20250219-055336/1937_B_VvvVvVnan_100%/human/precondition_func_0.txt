The function should accept three parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two binary strings a1 and a2 of length n, where each character in a1 and a2 is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
