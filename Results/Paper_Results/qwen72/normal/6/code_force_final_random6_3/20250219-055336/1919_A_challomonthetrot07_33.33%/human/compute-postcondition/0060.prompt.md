You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is `T-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1, and the current value of `b` is not 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple containing two integers (a, b) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is a string indicating whether Alice or Bob has more coins, or if they have the same number of coins. If `a` is greater than `b`, the result is "Alice"; if `b` is greater than `a`, the result is "Bob"; if `a` equals `b`, the result is "Equal".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
