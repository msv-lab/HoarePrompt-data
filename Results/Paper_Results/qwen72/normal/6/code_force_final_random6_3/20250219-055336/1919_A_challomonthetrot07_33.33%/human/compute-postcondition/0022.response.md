Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `a` is not equal to `b`, `b` is not equal to 1, `a` is even, and either `b` is even or `a` is odd. If `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`. If `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
