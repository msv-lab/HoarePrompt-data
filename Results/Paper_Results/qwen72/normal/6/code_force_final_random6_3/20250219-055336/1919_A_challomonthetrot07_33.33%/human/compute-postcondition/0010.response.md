The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The precondition provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **Bob**
