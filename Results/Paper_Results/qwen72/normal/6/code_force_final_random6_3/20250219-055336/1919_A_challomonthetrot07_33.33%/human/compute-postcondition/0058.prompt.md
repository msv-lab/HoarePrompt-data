Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases. The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `T`, is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(T, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1, and the current value of `b` is not 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
