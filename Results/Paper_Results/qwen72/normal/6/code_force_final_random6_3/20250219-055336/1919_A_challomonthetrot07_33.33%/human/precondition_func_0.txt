The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).
