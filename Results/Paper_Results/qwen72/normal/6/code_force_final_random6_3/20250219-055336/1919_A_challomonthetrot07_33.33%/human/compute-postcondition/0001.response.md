The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0. The state of `T` is already given as an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is specified that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, so `T` is already in a valid state for the loop to execute. However, the variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state before the loop starts, so we need to ensure it is properly initialized.

State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 0**
