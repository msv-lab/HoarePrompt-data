### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined without parameters, but it correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and the values of `a` and `b` for each test case from the standard input. This is a common practice in competitive programming where the function reads input directly.
   - The function uses a loop to handle each test case, which is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The game logic is based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and whether they are even or odd.
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins because Alice cannot make a move that changes the state, and Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to remove the last coin.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice wins because she can remove the coin and force Bob to play with an empty wallet.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob wins because he can remove the coin and force Alice to play with an empty wallet.
   - If `a % 2 == 1` (i.e., `a` is odd), Bob wins because he can always force Alice to play with an even number of coins, and Alice will eventually be forced to remove the last coin.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` (i.e., `a` is even and `b` is odd), Alice wins because she can force Bob to play with an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually be forced to remove the last coin.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins because he can always force Alice to play with a smaller number of coins, and Alice will eventually be forced to remove the last coin.
   - If `a <= b`, Alice wins because she can force Bob to play with a smaller number of coins, and Bob will eventually be forced to remove the last coin.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1, as Bob wins.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where one of the wallets has 1 coin, which is a critical point in the game.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The function assumes both players play optimally, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of `a` and `b` and their relative values is sound and aligns with the optimal play strategy.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The logic for determining the winner is flawed in several cases:
  - **If `a == 1` and `b > 1`:** Alice should win because she can remove the coin and force Bob to play with an empty wallet. However, the function incorrectly prints "Alice" in this case.
  - **If `b == 1` and `a > 1`:** Bob should win because he can remove the coin and force Alice to play with an empty wallet. However, the function incorrectly prints "Bob" in this case.
  - **If `a % 2 == 1` and `b % 2 == 1`:** Bob should win because he can always force Alice to play with an even number of coins. However, the function does not handle this case correctly.
  - **If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`:** The function does not handle this case correctly. The correct logic should be that the player with the larger number of coins will win, but the function does not consider this.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif (a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1) or (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and a > b):
            print('Bob')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1) or (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and a <= b):
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected program should handle all the edge cases and logical conditions correctly.
