Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a` is not equal to 1, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer. If `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd. Otherwise, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
