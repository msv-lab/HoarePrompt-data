Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. Here's why:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - If `a == b`, the program correctly prints "Bob" because the game will end in a draw, and Bob will win.
   - If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the program's logic is incorrect. For example, if `a == 1` and `b > 1`, Alice will always win because she can swap wallets and then Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his now-empty wallet, making Bob lose.

2. **Even and Odd Conditions**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if `a % 2 == 1`, Bob will always win. This is not true. For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 1`, Alice will win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin from Bob's wallet.
   - Similarly, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is not always correct. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 3`, Alice will win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin from Bob's wallet.

3. **Comparison Conditions**:
   - The conditions `a > b` and `a < b` are not sufficient to determine the winner. The game's outcome depends on the parity of the coins and the strategic moves of the players.

### Correct Logic:
To determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the coins and the strategic moves:

- If both `a` and `b` are even, the game will end in a draw, and Bob will win.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the game will also end in a draw, and Bob will win.
- If one of the wallets has 1 coin, the player with 1 coin will always lose because they cannot remove a coin from their wallet.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin from Bob's wallet.
- If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Bob can always win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin from Alice's wallet.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected program should correctly determine the winner based on the given problem description.
