The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing a string literal `'Bob'`.
- The initial state describes the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` but does not affect the `print` statement in any way.
- The relationship between `a` and `b` is described, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- The value of `i` is 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- The value of `T` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Bob**
