Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple containing two integers (a, b) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is a string indicating whether Alice or Bob has more coins, or if they have the same number of coins. If `a` is greater than `b`, the result is "Alice"; if `b` is greater than `a`, the result is "Bob"; if `a` equals `b`, the result is "Equal".**
