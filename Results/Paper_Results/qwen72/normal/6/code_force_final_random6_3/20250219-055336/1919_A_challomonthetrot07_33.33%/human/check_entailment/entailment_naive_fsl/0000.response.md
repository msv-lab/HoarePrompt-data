Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and greater than 1 correctly. According to the game rules, if both players have an even number of coins, the player with the larger number of coins will always win because they can force the game into a state where the other player is left with an even number of coins, which is always less than the larger player's even number of coins. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if `a > b`, Bob wins, and if `b > a`, Alice wins, regardless of whether the numbers are even or odd.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
```
The program will output "Bob", but the correct output should be "Alice". Alice can always win by swapping wallets, leaving Bob with 4 coins and herself with 2 coins. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin, leaving 3 coins, and Alice can swap again, leaving Bob with 2 coins and herself with 3 coins. This process will continue until Bob is left with 0 coins, and Alice wins.
