The provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should take the number of test cases and the details of each test case as input. Here is the correct function definition and precondition based on the problem description:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of test_cases is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
