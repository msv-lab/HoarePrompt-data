Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 4 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 4`, `nw` is the same as the previous value of `cw`. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` is True.***
