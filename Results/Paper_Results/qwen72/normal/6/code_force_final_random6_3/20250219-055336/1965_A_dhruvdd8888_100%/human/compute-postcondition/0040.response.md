The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, the function determines the outcome of a game where players take turns removing stones from the piles according to specific rules, and returns the result of the game for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns a list of results, each indicating the outcome of a game for the corresponding test case.**
