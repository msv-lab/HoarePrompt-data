Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `nw` is True, `cw` is True, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and the current value of `nums[i]` is 1.**
