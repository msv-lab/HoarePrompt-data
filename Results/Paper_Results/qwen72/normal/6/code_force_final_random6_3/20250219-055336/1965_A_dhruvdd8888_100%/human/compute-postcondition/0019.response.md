Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `nw` is True, `cw` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and the current value of `nums[i]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cw` is updated to `False` because `cw` is assigned the value of `not nw`, and `nw` is `True`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, `i`, and the current value of `nums[i]`) remain unchanged.
