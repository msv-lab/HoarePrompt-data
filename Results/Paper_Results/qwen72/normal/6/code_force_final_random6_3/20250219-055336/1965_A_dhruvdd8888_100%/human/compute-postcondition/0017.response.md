The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if the range defined by `range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)` has at least one value. This means that `len(nums) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, so `len(nums)` must be at least 3. 

Given the initial state, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, and each element in `nums` is now 0. To ensure the loop can execute, `nums` must have at least 3 elements. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `nums` has at least 3 elements, and `i` is set to `len(nums) - 2` (which is the starting point of the loop).

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `nw` is True, `cw` is True, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
