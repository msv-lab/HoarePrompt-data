Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is 1, `nw` is the same as the last value of `cw`. If `nums[1]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` is True and `nums[1]` is not equal to 1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to 1 (inclusive).
- After all iterations, the index `i` will be 1, as the loop stops when `i` reaches 0.
- The variables `test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, and `ls` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `nw` will be the same as the last value of `cw` after the loop completes.
- The value of `cw` depends on the last iteration of the loop, which checks `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is 1, `cw` will be False; otherwise, `cw` will be True.
