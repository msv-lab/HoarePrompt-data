Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0, `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 0` (which is the same as `nums[0]`), `len(nums)` is at least 1.** 

The value of `nums[0]` is unchanged because `ls` is 0. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
