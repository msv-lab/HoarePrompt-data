Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input for each test case inside the loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` but does not define the function `func_1()` until after the loop. This means that `func_1()` is not defined when the loop tries to call it, leading to a runtime error.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` is flawed. The program attempts to determine the winner by manipulating the list of pile sizes and then iterating through it to decide the winner. However, the logic used to determine the winner is not correct for the game described.
   - Specifically, the program adds '0' to the set of pile sizes and then sorts it, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The game's outcome should be determined based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, not by adding a zero and manipulating the list in this way.

3. **Incorrect Use of Variables**:
   - The variables `nw` and `cw` are used to track the current and next player's winning status, but the logic for updating these variables is not correct. The program should instead focus on the parity of the number of odd-sized piles.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of odd-sized piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in nums if x % 2 == 1)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the number of piles and the pile sizes.
- **Odd Count Calculation**: The program counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
- **Determine Winner**: The winner is determined by checking if the number of odd-sized piles is odd. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

This solution is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
