The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `nums` is that it is a sorted list of integers and includes the integer 0. This means `nums` has at least one element (0), ensuring the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `i` is 0 (the starting index of the loop) and `nums` has at least one element (which it does, since it includes 0).

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0, `len(nums)` is at least 1**
