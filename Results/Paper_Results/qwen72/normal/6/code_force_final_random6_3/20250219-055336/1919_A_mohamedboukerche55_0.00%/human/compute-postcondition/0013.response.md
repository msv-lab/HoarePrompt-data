Postcondition: **`i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`, and the sum of `a` and `b` is even.**
