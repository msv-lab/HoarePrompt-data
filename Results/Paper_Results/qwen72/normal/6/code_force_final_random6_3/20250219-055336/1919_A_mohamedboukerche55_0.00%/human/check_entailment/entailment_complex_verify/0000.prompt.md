You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the string `'bob  '` exactly as it is written.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program retains these values. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2, the program also retains these values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from user input. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, the function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob  '; otherwise, it prints 'alice'. After processing all test cases, the function retains the values of `a` and `b` from the last test case, but does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints "bob" and "alice" with extra spaces, which does not match the expected output format ("Bob" and "Alice" without extra spaces).

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd to determine the winner. This is not the correct logic for the game. The game involves strategic moves where players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove a coin. The winner is determined based on the optimal play of both players, not just the parity of the sum of coins.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop that reads the test cases.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
1 1
1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
bob  
alice
```

The program prints the results for only the last test case and with incorrect formatting. Additionally, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. For example, in the case where both Alice and Bob have 1 coin each, the program incorrectly prints "bob" instead of "Bob".
