You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the string `'bob  '` exactly as it is written.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program retains these values. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2, the program also retains these values.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., the player whose wallet is empty) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If both players play optimally, the key to determining the winner is the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a draw or Bob will win because Alice will always be the one to make the last move that leaves both wallets empty.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be the one to make the last move that leaves both wallets empty, and thus Bob will lose.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not handle the output correctly. It should print "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces.
   - The program does not print the result for each test case immediately after processing it. Instead, it processes all test cases and then prints the result for the last test case only.

5. **Corrected Program:**
   - The program should print the result for each test case immediately after processing it.
   - The output should be "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program is incorrect because it does not print the results for each test case and includes extra spaces in the output.

Correctness: **False**
