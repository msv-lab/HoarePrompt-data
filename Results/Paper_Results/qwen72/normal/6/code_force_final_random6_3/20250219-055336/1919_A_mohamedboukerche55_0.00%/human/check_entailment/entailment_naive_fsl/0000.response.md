Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints "bob" and "alice" with extra spaces, which does not match the expected output format ("Bob" and "Alice" without extra spaces).

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd to determine the winner. This is not the correct logic for the game. The game involves strategic moves where players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove a coin. The winner is determined based on the optimal play of both players, not just the parity of the sum of coins.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop that reads the test cases.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
1 1
1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
bob  
alice
```

The program prints the results for only the last test case and with incorrect formatting. Additionally, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. For example, in the case where both Alice and Bob have 1 coin each, the program incorrectly prints "bob" instead of "Bob".
