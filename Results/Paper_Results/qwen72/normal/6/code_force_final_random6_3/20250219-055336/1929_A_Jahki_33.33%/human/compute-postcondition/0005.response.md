The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num2`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `num2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num2` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `num2` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 2, and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, `order` is set to 1. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.**
