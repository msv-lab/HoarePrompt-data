Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `order` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `order` to 0. The values of `a` and `num2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `a` and `num2`, along with the new value of `order`.
