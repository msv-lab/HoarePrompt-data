Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are the same correctly. According to the problem description, if all elements in the array are the same, the beauty should be 0. However, the function `func_1` is used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if it is, the program prints 0. This is incorrect because the function `func_1` checks for a non-increasing order, not all elements being the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
69 69 69
```
The program will call `func_1` with the array `[69, 69, 69]`. Since the array is already in non-decreasing order, `func_1` will return `True`, and the program will print 0. This is correct for this specific input, but the logic is flawed.

A more appropriate approach would be to check if all elements in the array are the same, and if so, print 0. Otherwise, sort the array and calculate the beauty as described.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if len(set(a)) == 1:  # Check if all elements are the same
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)
```

This version correctly handles the case where all elements are the same and calculates the beauty for other cases as required.
