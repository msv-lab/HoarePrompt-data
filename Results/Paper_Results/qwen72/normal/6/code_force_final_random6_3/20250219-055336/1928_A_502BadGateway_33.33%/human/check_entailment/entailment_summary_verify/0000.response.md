### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise.
   - The function does not consider the value of `a` at all, which is a critical oversight.

2. **Problem Requirements:**
   - Bob can form another rectangle if and only if one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1.
   - This is because if either dimension is even and greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

3. **Examples from the Original Assessment:**
   - **Input `3 3`:**
     - The function `func_1(3, 3)` returns 'no' because `b` is not even.
     - The correct answer is 'no' because neither `a` nor `b` is even, and thus Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - **Input `1 2`:**
     - The function `func_1(1, 2)` returns 'yes' because `b` is even.
     - The correct answer is 'no' because the 1x2 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.

4. **Additional Examples:**
   - **Input `2 6`:**
     - The function `func_1(2, 6)` returns 'yes' because `b` is even.
     - The correct answer is 'yes' because the 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.
   - **Input `2 1`:**
     - The function `func_1(2, 1)` returns 'no' because `b` is not even.
     - The correct answer is 'no' because the 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1.
   - If either condition is met, Bob can form another rectangle.
   - If neither condition is met, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The correct logic should consider both dimensions `a` and `b`.

Final: **False**
