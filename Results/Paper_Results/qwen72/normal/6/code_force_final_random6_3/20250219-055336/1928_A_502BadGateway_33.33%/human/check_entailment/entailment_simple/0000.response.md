Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then reassembling them. The key to solving this is to understand that a different rectangle can be formed if and only if the original rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions (considering that \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\) are the same).

The provided solution checks if \(b\) is an even number. If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with dimensions \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\). This new rectangle is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle as long as \(a \neq \frac{b}{2}\).

However, the solution does not consider the case where \(a\) is even. If \(a\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\). This new rectangle is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle as long as \(b \neq \frac{a}{2}\).

Therefore, the correct condition should be that either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other dimension is not half of the even dimension. The provided solution only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
