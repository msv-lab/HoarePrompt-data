Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if and only if one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1. 

For example, consider the input `3 3`:
- The function `func_1(3, 3)` will return 'no' because `b` is not even.
- However, the correct answer should be 'no' because neither `a` nor `b` is even, and thus Bob cannot form another rectangle.

Another example, consider the input `1 2`:
- The function `func_1(1, 2)` will return 'yes' because `b` is even.
- However, the correct answer should be 'no' because the 1x2 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.

The program fails to handle these cases correctly, so it is incorrect.
