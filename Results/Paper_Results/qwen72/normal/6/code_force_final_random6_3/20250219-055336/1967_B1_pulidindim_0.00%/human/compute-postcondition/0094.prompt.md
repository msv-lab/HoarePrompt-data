Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `t` is now a specific positive integer provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of values calculated in each iteration of the loop, where each value is `(n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1` for `k` from 2 to `m`, and the loop breaks if `g` (which is `n / k - (k - 1)`) is less than `countmins` (which is `k - 1`) at any iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `ans` is equal to `n + Î£((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k from 2 to m`, where `k` is the loop counter starting from 2 and incrementing by 1 each iteration. The loop will stop either when `count` exceeds `m` or when `g` (which is `n / count - (count - 1)`) is less than `count - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of adjustments made in each iteration of the loop, where each adjustment is calculated as `g / count + 1` and `g` is updated in each iteration to `n / count - (count - 1)`. The loop stops when `g` is less than `count - 1` or when `count` exceeds `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
