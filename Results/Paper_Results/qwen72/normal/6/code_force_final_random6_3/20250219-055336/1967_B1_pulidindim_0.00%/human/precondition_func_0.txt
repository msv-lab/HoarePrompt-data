The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are provided, and the function should calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
