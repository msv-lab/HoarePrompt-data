The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is expected to take two parameters `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and `t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.

State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
