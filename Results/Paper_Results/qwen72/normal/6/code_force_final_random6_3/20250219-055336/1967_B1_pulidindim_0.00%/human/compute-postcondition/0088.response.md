Postcondition: ***`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user with `m` being greater than or equal to 5, `count` is 5, `ans` is now equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + g / 4 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is now equal to `n / 5`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
