### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the modulus `M` to \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of children out of all possible pairs. This is done using the formula \( c = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^{-1} \mod M \).
   - The use of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is correct for finding the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends and stores this sum in `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each of the `k` excursions.
   - The formula used in the loop is \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).
   - This formula is incorrect because:
     - The term `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
     - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be \( c \cdot (a + i \cdot m) \), where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values and `i * m` is the expected increase in friendship values after `i` excursions.
   - The correct formula should be \( s = s + c \cdot (a + i \cdot m) \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `s % M` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed expected value calculation. The corrected program provided in the original assessment should be used instead.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        print(s)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed expected value calculation. The corrected program provided in the original assessment should be used instead.
