To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with specific constraints.
- Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` with specific constraints.
- The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^5.
- The sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

However, for the loop to execute, the only relevant state is the value of `int(input())`, which should be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop itself.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
