Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic for updating the sum `s` is flawed. Let's break down the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` in the loop, which is incorrect.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is not a valid part of the expected value calculation. This term seems to be an attempt to account for the increasing friendship value, but it is not correctly formulated.
   - The term `c * a` is the expected value of the sum of the initial friendship values, but it should be adjusted for each excursion.

2. **Correct Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - For each excursion, the expected value of the friendship value for a chosen pair is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs, divided by the total number of pairs, plus the probability of choosing a friend pair times the number of excursions already completed.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - The expected value for the i-th excursion is `a * c + i * (m * c)`, where `a * c` is the expected value of the initial friendship values and `i * (m * c)` is the expected value of the increase in friendship value due to previous excursions.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, which is necessary given the constraints.
   - The modular multiplicative inverse `c` is correctly calculated as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should sum the expected values for each excursion, which can be simplified to:
     ```python
     s = (a * k + m * (k * (k - 1) // 2)) * c % M
     ```

Let's rewrite the program with the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = (a * k + m * (k * (k - 1) // 2)) * c % M
        print(s)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`**: Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of pairs of children.
- **`a = 0`**: Initialize the sum of initial friendship values.
- **`for i in range(m)`**: Sum the initial friendship values.
- **`s = (a * k + m * (k * (k - 1) // 2)) * c % M`**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k excursions.
  - `a * k`: The expected value of the initial friendship values over k excursions.
  - `m * (k * (k - 1) // 2)`: The expected value of the increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.
  - `* c % M`: Apply the modular multiplicative inverse and take the result modulo M.

### Re-evaluation of the Original Program:
- The original program's logic for updating `s` is incorrect, as it does not correctly account for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The corrected program aligns with the problem description and correctly calculates the expected value.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the program's incorrectness. The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Final: **False**
