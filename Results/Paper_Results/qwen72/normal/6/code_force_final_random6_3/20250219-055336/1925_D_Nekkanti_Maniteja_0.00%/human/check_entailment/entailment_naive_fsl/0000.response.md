Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum `s` in the loop is incorrect. The program should calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and then sum these expected values. However, the current implementation incorrectly updates the sum `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion, which does not align with the problem description.

### Incorrect Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
- **n = 3**: There are 3 children.
- **m = 1**: There is 1 pair of friends.
- **k = 2**: There are 2 excursions.
- **Friendship Pair (1, 2) with initial value 1**.

For this input, the program should calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each of the 2 excursions and then sum these expected values.

1. **First Excursion**:
   - Probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) is `1 / 3`.
   - Expected friendship value for the first excursion is `1 * (1 / 3) = 1 / 3`.

2. **Second Excursion**:
   - If the pair (1, 2) was chosen in the first excursion, its friendship value becomes 2.
   - If the pair (1, 2) was not chosen in the first excursion, its friendship value remains 1.
   - Expected friendship value for the second excursion is `(1 * (2 / 3) + 2 * (1 / 3)) = 4 / 3`.

The total expected value for both excursions is:
```
(1 / 3) + (4 / 3) = 5 / 3
```

However, the program calculates:
```
s = 0
c = 1 / 6
a = 1
for i in range(2):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
s % M
```

This results in:
```
s = 0 + (1/6 * 0 * 1/6 * 1 + 1/6 * 1) + (1/6 * 1 * 1/6 * 1 + 1/6 * 1)
  = 0 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/36 + 1/6
  = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/36
  = 3/6 + 1/36
  = 1/2 + 1/36
  = 18/36 + 1/36
  = 19/36
```

This is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be `5 / 3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
