Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` and `v` are assigned integer values from the input, `f` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the input, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`, `k < int(input())`, `n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `k` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `c` is assigned the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- The modular multiplicative inverse of a number `x` modulo `M` is a number `y` such that `(x * y) % M = 1`.
- The value of `c` is calculated using the `pow` function with the third argument as `M`, which computes the modular inverse.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
