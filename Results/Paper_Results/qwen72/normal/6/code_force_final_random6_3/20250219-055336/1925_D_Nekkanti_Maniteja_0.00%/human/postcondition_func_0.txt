The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints, and then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It calculates a final accumulated value `s` using modular arithmetic and prints `s` modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
