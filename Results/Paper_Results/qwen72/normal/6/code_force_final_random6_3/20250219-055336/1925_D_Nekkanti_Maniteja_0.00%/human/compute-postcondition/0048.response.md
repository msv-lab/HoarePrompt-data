The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `i` being less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is updated to `c * c * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`
- `i` is `k-1`
- `k` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3
- `m` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3
- `u` is the last integer value from the input
- `v` is the last integer value from the input
- `f` is the last integer value from the input
- `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input
- `n` is assigned a new integer value from the input
- `M` is 1000000007
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k`.
- The value of `int(input())` must be greater than `k` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is `c * c * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `i` is `k`, `k` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `n` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than `k`**.
