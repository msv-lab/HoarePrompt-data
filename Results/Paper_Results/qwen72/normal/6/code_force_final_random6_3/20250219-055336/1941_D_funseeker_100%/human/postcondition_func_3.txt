The function `func_4` accepts no parameters but relies on the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` returned by `func_3`. It performs a series of operations over `m` iterations, where in each iteration, it updates a set `ans` based on the values returned by `func_1`. The set `ans` initially contains the value `x` and is updated to include all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. After `m` iterations, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`. The function then prints the length of `ans` and a sorted list of the values in `ans`. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` contains the unique values derived from the operations described, possibly including `n` but not `0`.
