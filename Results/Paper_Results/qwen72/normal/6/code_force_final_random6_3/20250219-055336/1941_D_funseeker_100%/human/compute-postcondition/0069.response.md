Output State: **After all iterations, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a non-empty set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `r` and `c` remain unchanged. `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The set `ans` will contain all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. The variables `r` and `c` also remain unchanged. The set `temp` will contain all the unique values that were added during the loop, which are the same as the final contents of `ans`.
