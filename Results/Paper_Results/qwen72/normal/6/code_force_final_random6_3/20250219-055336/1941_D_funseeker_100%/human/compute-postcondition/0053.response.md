Postcondition: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is an empty set.**
