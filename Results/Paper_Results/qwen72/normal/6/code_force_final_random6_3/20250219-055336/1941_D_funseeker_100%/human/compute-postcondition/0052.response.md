To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `q` and the set `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Objects**: The loop head contains `q` and `ans`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `ans` is not empty.
3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000.
   - `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n.
   - `ans` is a set containing specific values based on the conditions involving `c` and `r`.
   - `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp` is an empty set.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`ans`**: For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. The initial state does not guarantee that `ans` is non-empty, so we need to ensure that `ans` is non-empty.
- **`q`**: The variable `q` will be assigned values from `ans` during the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted explicitly.

### Final State:
The final state should ensure that `ans` is non-empty. The other variables and conditions can remain as they are, as they do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
