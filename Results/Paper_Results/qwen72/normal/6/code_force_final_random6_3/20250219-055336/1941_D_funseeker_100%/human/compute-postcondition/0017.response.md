Postcondition: ***`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the value `x` and at least one more element, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(q + r) % n`, and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the values `(x - r) % n`, `(q + r) % n`, and `(q - r) % n`.***
