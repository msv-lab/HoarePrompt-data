You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a string containing the user's input with whitespace trimmed.

#Function 2:

    #State: `n` remains unchanged with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the set `ans` from the previous iteration if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', for each of the `m` iterations. `r` and `c` are the integer and string values, respectively, returned by `func_1().split()` during each iteration of the loop.

        ans.discard(0)

    #State: *`n` remains unchanged with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= m <= 1000, `x` remains unchanged with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the set `ans` from the previous iteration if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', for each of the `m` iterations. If 0 is in `ans`, then 0 is removed from `ans` and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set of unique values modulo `n` after `m` iterations, and if 0 is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted list of unique values from the set `ans` (where `ans` contains values derived from the operations \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) if `c` is '1' or '?', or \((q + r) \% n\) if `c` is '0', and does not include `0` but may include `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters but relies on the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` returned by `func_3`. It performs a series of operations over `m` iterations, where in each iteration, it updates a set `ans` based on the values returned by `func_1`. The set `ans` initially contains the value `x` and is updated to include all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', or only values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. After `m` iterations, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`. The function then prints the length of `ans` and a sorted list of the values in `ans`. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` contains the unique values derived from the operations described, possibly including `n` but not `0`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the direction is '0' or '1' and the resulting position is out of bounds. Specifically, when calculating the new position using `(q - r) % n` for counterclockwise throws, if `q - r` is negative, the result of the modulo operation can be incorrect. For example, if `n = 5`, `q = 1`, and `r = 3`, then `(q - r) % n` results in `-2 % 5`, which is `3` in Python. However, the correct position should be `4` (since 1 - 3 = -2, and -2 + 5 = 3, but the player is numbered from 1 to 5, so it should be 4). This can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should adjust the position to ensure it is within the valid range of player numbers (1 to n). For example, for counterclockwise throws, the correct calculation would be `(q - r - 1) % n + 1` to handle the case where `q - r` is negative. Similarly, for clockwise throws, the correct calculation would be `(q + r - 1) % n + 1` to handle the case where `q + r` exceeds `n`.
