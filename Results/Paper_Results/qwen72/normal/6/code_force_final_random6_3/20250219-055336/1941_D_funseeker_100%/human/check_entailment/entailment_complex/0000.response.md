Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` handle the input correctly. `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. `func_2` converts this input to an integer, which is used to determine the number of test cases. `func_3` reads another line from standard input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer, which is used to initialize `n`, `m`, and `x`.

2. **Set Initialization**: The function `func_4` initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the game starts with the ball at player `x`.

3. **Loop and Set Updates**: The loop in `func_4` correctly processes each throw. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. It then updates the set `ans` by adding the possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. The conditions for updating the set are:
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise), it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise), it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction is '?', it adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the set.

4. **Handling Modulo 0**: After the loop, the function checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and a modulo operation can result in `0`, which should be interpreted as `n`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**: The functions handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is 2 and `r` is 1, the set `ans` will correctly include both players after each throw, regardless of the direction.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem's requirements and handle all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
