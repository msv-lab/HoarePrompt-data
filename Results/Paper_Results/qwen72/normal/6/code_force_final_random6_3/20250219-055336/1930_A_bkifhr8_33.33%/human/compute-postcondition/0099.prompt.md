Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (which is -1), `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from each test case, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, and `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `lst` will have all but the last two elements removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in ans_f:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least one element, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed if the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, or the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers if the length of `lst` was exactly 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is the second element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed if the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, or the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers if the length of `lst` was exactly 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is the third element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least three elements, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed if the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, or the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers if the length of `lst` was exactly 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
