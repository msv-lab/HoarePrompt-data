Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

However, the program has a logical flaw in how it processes the list of integers. Specifically, the way it removes elements from the list is incorrect. The code uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are intended to remove the first and second elements of the list, but due to the multiplication by 2, it will remove elements at indices 0 and 2, which is not what is intended. This will lead to incorrect results.

The correct approach should be to sort the list of integers and then sum the first `n` elements, as the first `n` elements in a sorted list will always be the minimum values of the pairs when taken in pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

Given the original program's logic, it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
