Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Reading the List of Integers**: For each test case, the program reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers. The list is read as a string and split into a list of strings, which is then processed.

3. **Processing the List**: The program attempts to process the list of integers by repeatedly selecting the first two elements, computing the minimum of these two elements, and adding it to the score. However, there are several issues with this approach:
   - The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correspond to the indices of the elements being removed.
   - The program does not sort the list, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always selected in pairs to maximize the score.

4. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to sort the list of integers and then pair the smallest elements together. This ensures that the minimum values are always added to the score, which maximizes the total score.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**: The current logic in the program does not follow the optimal strategy and will not produce the correct maximum score for all test cases.

6. **Output**: The program correctly appends the computed score to a list `ans_f` and prints the results for each test case at the end.

Given the issues with the element removal and the lack of sorting, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
