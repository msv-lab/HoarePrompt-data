Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
