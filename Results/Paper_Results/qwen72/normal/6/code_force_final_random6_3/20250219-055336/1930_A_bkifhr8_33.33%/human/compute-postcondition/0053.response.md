The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n * 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0, ensuring that `i` is still less than `n * 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.**
