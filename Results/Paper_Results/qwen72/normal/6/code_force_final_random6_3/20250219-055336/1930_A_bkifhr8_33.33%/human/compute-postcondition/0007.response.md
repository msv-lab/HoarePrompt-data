The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n * 2` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is an input integer, it must be greater than 0 for `n * 2` to be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which is correct for the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter.**
