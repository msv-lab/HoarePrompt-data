You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1` (which is -1), `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from each test case, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, and `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `lst` will have all but the last two elements removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed. If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` has iterated through all elements of `ans_f`, `ans_f` contains all the elements it had initially, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed if the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, or the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers if the length of `lst` was exactly 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases based on the provided integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
