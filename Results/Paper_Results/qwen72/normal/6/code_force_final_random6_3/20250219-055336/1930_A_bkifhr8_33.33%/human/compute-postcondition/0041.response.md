Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (which is 0), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, `lst` has had its first and third elements removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the third element of `lst` (since `1 * 2` equals 2, and list indices are 0-based).
- The initial state indicates that `lst` has had its first element removed, so after this code, `lst` will have its first and third elements removed.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
