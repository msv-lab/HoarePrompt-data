### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n`.
   - It then reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0 for each test case.
   - It attempts to process the list `lst` by removing elements and adding the minimum of the first two elements to `ans`.

3. **Element Removal and Minimum Calculation**:
   - The function uses a loop to iterate `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate `n` times since each iteration processes a pair of elements.
   - The function incorrectly removes elements using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This will not remove the correct elements and will lead to incorrect results.
   - The correct approach should be to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements, as the minimum of each pair will always be the smaller element, and the smallest `n` elements will be the optimal choice to maximize the score.

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly appends the final score `ans` to `ans_f` and prints the results after processing all test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

- **Incorrect Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates `n * 2` times instead of `n` times. This is unnecessary and incorrect.
- **Incorrect Element Removal**: The `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` lines are incorrect and will not remove the elements as intended. Instead, the elements should be removed in pairs.
- **Optimal Solution**: The optimal solution involves sorting the list and summing the first `n` elements, which are the smallest elements and will always be the minimum of each pair.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest elements
        lst.sort()
        
        # Sum the first n elements to get the maximum score
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting**: The list `lst` is sorted to ensure that the smallest elements are at the beginning.
- **Summing the First n Elements**: The first `n` elements of the sorted list are summed to get the maximum score, as these will always be the minimum of each pair.
- **Appending and Printing**: The results are appended to `ans_f` and printed after processing all test cases.
