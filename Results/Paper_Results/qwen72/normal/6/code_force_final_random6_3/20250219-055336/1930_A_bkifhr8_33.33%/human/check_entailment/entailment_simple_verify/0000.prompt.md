You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

        for i in range(n * 2):

                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements:**
   - The line `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. The multiplication by 2 is unnecessary and will cause the program to remove elements that are not the first two elements of the list.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements would be `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the list has exactly two elements correctly. The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` should be `if len(lst) > 2:` to ensure that the loop continues until only two elements are left.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program does not follow the optimal strategy for maximizing the score. The optimal strategy is to sort the list and then always pick the smallest two elements to maximize the sum of the minimum values. The current implementation does not sort the list, which can lead to suboptimal results.

**Example Case:**
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  2
  1 3 2 4
  ```
  The program will output:
  ```
  3
  ```
  However, the correct output should be:
  ```
  4
  ```
  The optimal way to achieve the maximum score is to first pick 1 and 2 (score += 1), then pick 3 and 4 (score += 3), resulting in a total score of 4. The program does not sort the list, so it picks 1 and 3 (score += 1), then 2 and 4 (score += 2), resulting in a total score of 3, which is incorrect.
