Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is 0, and the length of `lst` is not 2. The first element of `lst` has been removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst` (since `0 * 2` is 0).
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `ans_f`, `l`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The length of `lst` is now one less than it was before, but it is still not 2.
