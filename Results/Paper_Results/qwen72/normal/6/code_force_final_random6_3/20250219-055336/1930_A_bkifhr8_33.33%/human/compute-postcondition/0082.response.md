Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is a new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` remains 0. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` (which was 0) and the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
