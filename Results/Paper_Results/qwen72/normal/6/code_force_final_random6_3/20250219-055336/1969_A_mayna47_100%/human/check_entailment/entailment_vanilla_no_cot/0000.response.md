Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. It only checks if there is a pair of friends (i, v[i]) such that v[v[i]] == i and prints 2 if such a pair exists, otherwise it prints 3. This approach is flawed because:

1. It does not handle cases where there are more than one pair of friends who are each other's best friends. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   4
   2 1 4 3
   ```
   The correct answer should be 2, but the program will print 3 because it only checks the first pair and doesn't consider the possibility of multiple pairs.

2. It does not handle cases where the minimum number of invitations required is more than 3. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   6
   2 3 4 5 6 1
   ```
   The correct answer should be 4, but the program will print 3.

3. It does not handle cases where the minimum number of invitations required is exactly 3, but the friends are not in a simple pair. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   4
   2 3 4 1
   ```
   The correct answer is 3, and the program correctly prints 3, but it does so without a proper algorithm to ensure it's the minimum.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to find the smallest set of friends such that inviting them ensures at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves identifying cycles and pairs in the best friend relationships and determining the minimum number of invitations required to cover these cycles or pairs.
