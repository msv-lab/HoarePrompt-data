### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `v` is initialized with an extra element at the beginning (index 0) to make the indices 1-based, which aligns with the problem's description.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that friend `i` and friend `v[i]` are mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, as inviting both friends in this pair will ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3` and returns.
   - This assumption is not always correct. The minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party can be less than 3 in some cases.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of Mutual Best Friends Check:**
  - The condition `v[v[i]] == i` correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends.
  - If such a pair is found, inviting both friends will ensure that both come to the party, which satisfies the requirement of having at least 2 friends at the party.

- **Default Case:**
  - The default case assumes that if no mutual best friends are found, the minimum number of invitations needed is 3.
  - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. In this case, there are no mutual best friends, but inviting any 2 friends will still ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party because each invited friend's best friend is also invited.

### Counterexample:
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 1 4 3
  ```
  - The program will print `3`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 are mutual best friends, and inviting them will ensure both come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to identify situations where the minimum number of invitations needed is less than 3 even if no mutual best friends are found.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
