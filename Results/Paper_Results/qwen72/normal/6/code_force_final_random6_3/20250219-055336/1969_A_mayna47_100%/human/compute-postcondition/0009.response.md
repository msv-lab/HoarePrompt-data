Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(2)` is very straightforward. It simply prints the integer value 2.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and lists, but none of these details affect the print statement `print(2)` because the statement does not reference any of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the integer value 2.

Output: **2**
