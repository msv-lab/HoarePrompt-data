Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 1, `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 1`, `i` is `x - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

### Natural Language Explanation
- The initial state of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `_` is still 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `s` starts at 1 and is updated `x` times according to the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The variable `i` is used in the loop but does not affect the final state of `s` and is not modified outside the loop.
- The condition `int(input())` must be greater than `x` is required for the loop to execute at least `x` times.

After the loop has executed `x` times, the value of `s` will be the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` applied `x` times starting from `s = 1`. The variable `i` will be `x - 1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `x - 1`.
