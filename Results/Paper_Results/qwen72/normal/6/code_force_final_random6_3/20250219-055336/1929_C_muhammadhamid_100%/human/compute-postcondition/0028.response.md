Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 2, `s` is 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1), `i` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `s` is calculated as `1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)`.
- The code `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `s` by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to the current value of `s`.
- The new value of `s` is therefore `1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1)`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than `x` still holds.
