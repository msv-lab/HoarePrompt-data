Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 1, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `x - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

Explanation:
- `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `s` is 1.
- The expression `s // (k - 1)` is evaluated. Since `s` is 1, `1 // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any integer `k` greater than 1.
- Therefore, `s` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and the condition on `int(input())`) remain unchanged.
