Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The code snippet `k = abs(n - m)` calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `n` and `m` (being input integers greater than 0) still hold. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `k` while keeping the other variables and conditions the same.
