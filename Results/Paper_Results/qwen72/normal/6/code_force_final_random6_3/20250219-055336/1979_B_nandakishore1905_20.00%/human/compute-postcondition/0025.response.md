The value of `l` is set to the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0. The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
