Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the program retains the initial state of the variables. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is even or odd, the program retains the initial state of the variables. If neither of these conditions is met, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**
