Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `i` from user input, which specifies the number of iterations to perform. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, and prints a value based on the following conditions: If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it calculates the highest power of 2 less than `k` and prints the difference between `k` and that power of 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. **
