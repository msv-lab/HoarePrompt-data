Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The variable `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - Since `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, the value of `k` will be a non-negative integer.
   - The exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m` provided as input.

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
