Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
2. `i` is 0.
3. `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
4. `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
5. `k` is not a power of 2.
6. `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
7. `p` is the length of `l`.
8. `q` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(k - q)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` will be a non-negative integer.
   - Given that `k` is not a power of 2, it means `k` cannot be expressed as \(2^a\) for any integer \(a\).

2. **Determine `l`**:
   - `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. For example, if `k` is 5, then `l` would be '101'.

3. **Determine `p`**:
   - `p` is the length of `l`. For example, if `l` is '101', then `p` would be 3.

4. **Determine `q`**:
   - `q` is explicitly given as 2.

5. **Calculate `k - q`**:
   - The code snippet `print(k - q)` will print the value of `k` minus 2.
   - Since `k` is a non-negative integer and not a power of 2, `k - 2` will be a non-negative integer as well, provided `k` is at least 2.

### Final Output:
The `print(k - q)` statement will print the value of `k` minus 2, where `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is not a power of 2.

Output: **k - 2 (where k is the absolute difference between n and m and is not a power of 2)**
