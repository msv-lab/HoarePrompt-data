The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(1)` statement is executed.
   - The value `1` is a constant integer.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
