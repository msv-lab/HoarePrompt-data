Let's break down the initial state to understand the values involved:

1. **`x` and `y`**: These are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
2. **`i`**: This is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
3. **`n` and `m`**: These are input integers greater than 0.
4. **`k`**: This is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is also a power of 2.

Given that `k` is a power of 2, it means `k` can be one of the following values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.

The print statement is:
```
print(k)
```

Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is also a power of 2, the output will be one of the powers of 2 listed above. However, without knowing the specific values of `n` and `m`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and k is a power of 2)**
