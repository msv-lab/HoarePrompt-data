### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Deque Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a deque `nums` to efficiently handle the removal of elements from both ends of the list. This is a good choice for the problem as it allows for O(1) time complexity for both `popleft` and `pop` operations.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it removes the first and last ships from the deque (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If the number of remaining attacks is less than `2 * x`, it breaks out of the loop to handle the remaining attacks separately.

4. **Handling Remaining Ships:**
   - After the main loop, if there are still attacks left (`k > 0`) and only one ship remains (`len(nums) == 1`), it checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink the last ship.
   - If so, it increments the answer by 1 and returns it.
   - If not, it simply returns the current count of sunk ships.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no ships left to attack.
   - It also handles the case where the number of attacks is less than the durability of the remaining ships.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \le k \le 10^{15}\).
  - `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where \(1 \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^9\).

- **Function Execution:**
  - The function `func_1` initializes a deque `nums` and a counter `ans` for the number of sunk ships.
  - The main loop runs as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
  - In each iteration, it removes the first and last ships (`a` and `b`), calculates the minimum durability `x`, and reduces the durabilities of both ships by `x` if `k >= 2 * x`.
  - If `a` or `b` are reduced to 0 or less, they are not added back to the deque, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each such element.
  - The loop breaks if `k < 2 * x` or if there are fewer than two ships left.
  - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of that ship, the program increments `ans` by 1 and returns it.
  - Otherwise, it returns the current count of sunk ships.

### Verification of the Original Assessment:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads and processes the input as described.

- **Deque Initialization:**
  - Using a deque is appropriate for this problem as it allows efficient removal from both ends.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The loop logic is correct. It ensures that the Kraken attacks the first and last ships in the specified order and reduces their durabilities accordingly.
  - The loop breaks when the remaining attacks are not enough to fully reduce the durabilities of both ships, which is the correct behavior.

- **Handling Remaining Ships:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where only one ship remains and the remaining attacks are enough to sink it.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the remaining attacks are not enough to sink the last ship.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where all ships have been sunk.
  - It also handles the case where the number of attacks is less than the durability of the remaining ships.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description. It efficiently uses a deque to manage the ships and correctly handles the attacks in the specified order.

Final: **True**
