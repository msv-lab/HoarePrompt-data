To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `k` and `len(nums) >= 2`.

1. **Variable `k`**: The state indicates that `k` is a positive integer (1 <= k <= 10^15). Since `k` is already positive, it satisfies the condition `k` in the loop head.

2. **Variable `nums`**: The state indicates that `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums` where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9. For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than or equal to 2. Since the state does not specify the length of `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements.

Given that `k` is already positive and satisfies the condition, no adjustment is needed for `k`. However, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums` where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 and `len(nums)` must be greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is 0**
