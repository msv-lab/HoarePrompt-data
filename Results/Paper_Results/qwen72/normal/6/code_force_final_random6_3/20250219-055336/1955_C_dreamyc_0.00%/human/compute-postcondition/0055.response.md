The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element satisfies 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.

The function returns the total count of elements (`ans`) that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If `k` is greater than or equal to the single remaining element in `nums`, the function returns `ans + 1`.
