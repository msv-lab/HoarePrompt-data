Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first and last elements, `ans` is 0, `a` is `a - x`, `b` is `b - x`, `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of `x`.**

Explanation:
- `b -= x` updates the value of `b` by subtracting `x` from it.
- The value of `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of `x` still holds.
