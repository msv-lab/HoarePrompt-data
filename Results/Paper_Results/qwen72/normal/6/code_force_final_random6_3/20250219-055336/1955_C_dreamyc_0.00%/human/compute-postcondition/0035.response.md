Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements. `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque, and `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque. `k` is greater than 0, and `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, and if `a` > 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by 2 * `x`. If `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is not greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1, and the same conditions apply regarding `k` and `x` for `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, the value of `b` is appended to the end of the deque `nums`. If `b` is not greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1.***
