### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the list `nums` into a deque to efficiently pop elements from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - The main loop runs as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least two ships left in the deque.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last ships (`a` and `b`), calculates the minimum durability `x` of the two ships, and reduces both `a` and `b` by `x`.
   - It also reduces `k` by `2 * x` because the Kraken attacks both ships.
   - If `a` or `b` still have positive durability after the attack, they are added back to the deque. If they are reduced to 0 or less, they are not added back, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each such ship.
   - The loop breaks if `k` is less than `2 * x` or if there are fewer than two ships left.

3. **Final Checks:**
   - After the main loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of that ship, it is sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk (`ans`).

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- It efficiently manages the ships using a deque, which allows for O(1) operations for popping and appending elements from both ends.
- The logic for reducing the durabilities and counting the sunk ships is sound.
- The final check ensures that if there is only one ship left and it can be sunk with the remaining attacks, it is correctly counted.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Ship:** If there is only one ship initially, the program correctly handles this by checking if `k` is greater than or equal to the ship's durability.
- **No Attacks:** If `k` is 0, the program correctly returns 0 because no attacks are made.
- **All Ships Sunk:** If all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are exhausted, the program correctly stops and returns the count of sunk ships.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the described problem and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
