Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`, `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque minus the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`, `k` is now `k - 2 * x`, `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * x` from it.
- `x` is the minimum value between the original `a` and `b`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
