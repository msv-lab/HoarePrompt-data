Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the remaining elements after the loop has executed, which may be fewer than the original list `nums` and could be empty. `ans` is the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. `k` is less than `nums[0]` or `len(nums)` is not equal to 1, or both.**
