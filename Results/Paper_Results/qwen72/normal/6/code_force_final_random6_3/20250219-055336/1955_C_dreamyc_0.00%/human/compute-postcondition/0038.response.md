Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2. `a` is the value of the second element removed from the deque, and `b` is the value of the second-to-last element removed from the deque. `k` is greater than 0. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.**
