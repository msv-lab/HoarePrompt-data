Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first and last elements, `ans` is 0, `a` is `a - x`, `b` is `b - x`, `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`, and `k` is now `k - 2 * x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * x` from its original value.
- The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is `k - 2 * x`, which is still a positive integer as `k` was initially greater than or equal to `2 * x`.
