To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used in the statement.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last non-negative integer before a negative integer that resets `c` to 0.
- `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution, updated to be the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.

### Explanation:
1. **`2 ** k`**: This is 2 raised to the power of `k`.
2. **`maxi`**: This is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in the list `l` before encountering a negative integer.
3. **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
4. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`**: This is the expression that combines the above values.
5. **`% 1000000007`**: This is the modulo operation to ensure the result is within a specific range.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `2 ** k`**:
   - Since `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `2 ** k` will be a power of 2.

2. **Determine `maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in the list `l` before encountering a negative integer.
   - For example, if `l = [1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, then:
     - `c` will be 3 (1 + 2) before encountering -1, reset to 0.
     - `c` will be 7 (3 + 4) before encountering -2, reset to 0.
     - `c` will be 5 (5) before the end of the list.
     - `maxi` will be 7 (the maximum value of `c` observed).

3. **Calculate `sum(l)`**:
   - This is the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
   - For the example list `l = [1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`, `sum(l)` will be 10 (1 + 2 - 1 + 3 + 4 - 2 + 5).

4. **Combine the values**:
   - The expression `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` will be evaluated using the values of `2 ** k`, `maxi`, and `sum(l)`.
   - For the example, if `k = 3`:
     - `2 ** k` is 8.
     - `2 ** k * maxi` is 8 * 7 = 56.
     - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` is 56 - 7 = 49.
     - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` is 49 + 10 = 59.
     - `59 % 1000000007` is 59.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the input integer, maxi is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in the list l before encountering a negative integer, and sum(l) is the sum of all integers in the list l)**
