The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`.

- If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0
- `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements
- `ele` is the third element in the list `l`
- If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.

After executing the code:
- If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, `maxi` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is `c + ele` if `ele` >= 0 or `c` > `abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0 if `ele` >= 0 or `c` > `abs(ele)`, otherwise `maxi` remains 0.**
