Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is `ele`, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and either `ele` is greater than or equal to 0, or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated to `c + ele`. Since `c` was initially 0, `c` now holds the value of `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that either `ele` is greater than or equal to 0, or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)` is still valid, as `c` now equals `ele`.
