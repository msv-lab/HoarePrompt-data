The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the input value provided to `range()`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input value to `range()` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` from the last negative element (or from the start if no negative element is encountered) to the end of the list, and `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.**
