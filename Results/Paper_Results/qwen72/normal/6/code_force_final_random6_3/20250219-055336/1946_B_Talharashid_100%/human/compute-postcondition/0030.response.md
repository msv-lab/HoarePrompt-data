Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user, and both must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` to a new list of integers input by the user.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged, but `l` is now a new list of integers.
- The precondition that `n` and `k` must be greater than 1 is still valid, but their specific values are not known after the user input.
- The precondition that `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi` remains valid, but the new list `l` will affect the value of `c` and potentially `maxi` in subsequent code execution.
