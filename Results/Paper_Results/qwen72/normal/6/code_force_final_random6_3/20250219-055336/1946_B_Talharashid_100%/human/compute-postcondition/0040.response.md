Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum value between `ele` and 0.***
