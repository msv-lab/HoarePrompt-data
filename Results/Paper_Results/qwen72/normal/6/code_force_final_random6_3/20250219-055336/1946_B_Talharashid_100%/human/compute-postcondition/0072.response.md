Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is set to the maximum value between `ele` and 0, and `c` is now `c + ele`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same for `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`. The value of `ele` is still the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` and `maxi` remain unchanged at 0. Otherwise, `c` is initially set to `ele`, and then `c` is incremented by `ele` again, making `c` equal to `2 * ele`. The value of `maxi` is the maximum value between `ele` and 0.
