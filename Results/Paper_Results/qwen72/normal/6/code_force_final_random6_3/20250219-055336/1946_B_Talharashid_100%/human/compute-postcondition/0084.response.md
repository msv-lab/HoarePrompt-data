Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution, updated to be the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `t-1` (since the loop starts from 0 and runs `t` times). For each iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. The variable `c` will hold the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` observed during the entire loop execution, which is updated at each iteration to be the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`. The final output for each test case is the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
