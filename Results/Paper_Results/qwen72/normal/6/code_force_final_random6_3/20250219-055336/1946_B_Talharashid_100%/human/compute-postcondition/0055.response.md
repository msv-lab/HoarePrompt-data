Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` from the last negative element (or from the start if no negative element is encountered) to the end of the list.
- `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `c` and `maxi`**:
   - `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` from the last negative element to the end of the list.
   - If there are no negative elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and `c`.

2. **Calculating the Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `2 ** k`: This is 2 raised to the power of `k`.
     - `2 ** k * maxi`: This is the result of multiplying `2 ** k` by `maxi`.
     - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`: This is the result of subtracting `maxi` from `2 ** k * maxi`.
     - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`: This is the result of adding the sum of all elements in `l` to the previous result.
     - `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`: This is the result of taking the modulo 1000000007 of the previous result.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
- Since the exact values of `k`, `l`, and `maxi` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of integers with at least n elements, and maxi is the maximum of the previous maxi and the sum of the non-negative elements of l from the last negative element to the end of the list)**
