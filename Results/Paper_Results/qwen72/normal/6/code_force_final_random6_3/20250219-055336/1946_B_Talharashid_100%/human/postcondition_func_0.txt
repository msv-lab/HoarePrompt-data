The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list of integers `l`, the length of the list `n`, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of non-negative integers in `l`, and then computes a result based on this maximum sum, the number of operations `k`, and the total sum of the list `l`. The final result for each test case is printed, and it is the value of `(2
