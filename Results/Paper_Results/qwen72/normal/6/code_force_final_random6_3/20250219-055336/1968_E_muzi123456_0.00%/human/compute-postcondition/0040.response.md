Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3.
   - `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The values of `t` and `n` are not directly used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
