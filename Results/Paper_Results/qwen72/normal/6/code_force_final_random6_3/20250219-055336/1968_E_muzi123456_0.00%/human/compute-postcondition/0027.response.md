Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as `t - 2` because the loop does not modify `t` in any way.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) because the loop does not modify `n`.
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the value `n`. This is because the loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and the last value `i` takes on is `n`.

So, the final output state is that `i` is equal to `n`, while `t` and `n` remain as they were initially described.
