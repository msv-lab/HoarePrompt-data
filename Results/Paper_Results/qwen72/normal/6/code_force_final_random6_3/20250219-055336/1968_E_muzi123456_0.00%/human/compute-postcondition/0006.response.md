Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `t` is now `t - 1`. This means that `t` has been decremented by 1, but this does not affect the value of `i`.
   - `n` is an input integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the value of the variable `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly defined as 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1**
