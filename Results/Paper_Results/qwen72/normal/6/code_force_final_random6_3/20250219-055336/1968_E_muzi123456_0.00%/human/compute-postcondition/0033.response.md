Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3.
- `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space character instead of a newline.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, as it is not used in the statement.
- The value of `n` is also not directly relevant to the `print` statement, as it is not used in the statement.
- The value of `i` is 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space character.

Output: **1 **
