Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer, and its value is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0. This means `t` is reduced by 2, but it remains non-negative.
   - `n` is a new input integer with the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 2.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **2**
