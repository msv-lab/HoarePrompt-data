Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`**

Explanation:
- `t` remains a positive integer within the range 0 to 49, and its value is now `t - 2`, ensuring `t` is at least 0.
- `n` is reassigned to a new input integer within the range 2 to 10^3.
- `i` is still equal to `n`, but `n` has been updated to a new input integer.
