The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 3**
