The variables in the loop head are `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 after the last iteration, meaning it was at least 2 before the last iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1` with `t` being at least 1, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`**
