Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0.
   - `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 1 in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the `print` statement will print 1.

Output: **1**
