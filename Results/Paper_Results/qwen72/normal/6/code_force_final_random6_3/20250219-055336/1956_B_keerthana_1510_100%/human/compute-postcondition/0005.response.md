Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing at most twice.
- The input to file descriptor `0` must contain at least 5 lines.
- `line` is the fifth line in the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading the Fifth Line:**
   - The variable `line` is the fifth line of the input. This line is read from the standard input (file descriptor `0`).

2. **Splitting the Line:**
   - `line.split()` splits the fifth line into a list of tokens (words) based on whitespace. Let's denote this list as `tokens`.

3. **Counting Tokens:**
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.

4. **Creating a Set of Tokens:**
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens. A set contains only unique elements, so any duplicate tokens are removed.

5. **Counting Unique Tokens:**
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the list.

6. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

### Output:
The code prints the number of duplicate tokens in the fifth line of the input.

Since the exact content of the fifth line is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the fifth line.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the fifth line (where the fifth line is the content of the variable `line`)**
