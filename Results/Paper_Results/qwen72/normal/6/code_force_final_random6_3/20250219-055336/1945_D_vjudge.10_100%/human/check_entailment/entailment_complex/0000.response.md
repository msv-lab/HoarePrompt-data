Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to iterate backward through the queue, starting from the last person (initially Kirill's position) and moving towards the front. For each person `i` in the queue, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the cost of moving Kirill to position `i` (which is `x + a[i]` if `i < m`). The variable `x` accumulates the minimum cost between bribing the person at position `i` to move to a position `j < i` (which is `a[i]`) and the cost of moving Kirill past the person at position `i` (which is `b[i]`).

However, there is a logical issue in the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The current implementation updates `pergunta` with the cost of moving to position `i` only if `i < m`. This is correct, but the accumulation of `x` with `min(a[i], b[i])` is not. The variable `x` should only accumulate the cost of bribing people to move past them (`b[i]`), not the cost of moving to a specific position (`a[i]`).

The correct implementation should accumulate the cost of moving past each person (`b[i]`) and then, for each position `i` where `i < m`, consider the cost of moving to that position (`x + a[i]`) to update `pergunta`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += b[i]
        
    print(pergunta)
```

In the original program, the line `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is incorrect because it adds the minimum cost of either bribing the person at position `i` to move to a position `j < i` or the cost of moving Kirill past the person at position `i`. This can lead to an incorrect total cost if `a[i]` is chosen, as it should not be part of the cumulative cost `x` when considering the cost of moving past people.

Given the original implementation, the program will not always produce the correct minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
