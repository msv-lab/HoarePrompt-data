Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. It calculates and prints the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`, where `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. The lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged. **
