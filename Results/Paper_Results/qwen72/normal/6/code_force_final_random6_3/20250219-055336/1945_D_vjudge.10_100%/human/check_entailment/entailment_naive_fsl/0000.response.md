Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to a position within the first `m` people. The function `func_1` is called but it does not actually perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function does not correctly account for the cost of moving Kirill to a position `j` and the subsequent costs for each `k` such that `j < k < i`. The function simply iterates from the end of the queue and accumulates costs, but it does not implement the required logic for the problem.

A potential case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will not produce the correct output because the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required algorithm to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
