Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]`.
- The value of `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `i` is `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `i`) retain their original values and conditions.
