Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `flag` is True if `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[0]`. If `arr[1]` is not equal to `arr[0]`, `flag` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
