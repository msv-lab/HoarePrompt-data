Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It then checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element of `arr` and prints this minimum length. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `arr` retain their input values, and the program state includes the printed output, which is either `-1` or the minimum length of consecutive subarrays as described. **
