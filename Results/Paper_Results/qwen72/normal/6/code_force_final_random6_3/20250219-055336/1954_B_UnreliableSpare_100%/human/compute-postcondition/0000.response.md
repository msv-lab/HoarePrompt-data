Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters.** 

The value of `n` is now an integer input by the user, and the other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
