You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It then checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element of `arr` and prints this minimum length. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `arr` retain their input values, and the program state includes the printed output, which is either `-1` or the minimum length of consecutive subarrays as described.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.

2. **Checking for Identical Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any element is different from the previous one. If all elements are the same, the array is considered beautiful, and the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program then initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`val`).
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - After the loop, it ensures the final count is considered by updating `ans` one last time.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array is not all identical, the program outputs the minimum count of consecutive elements found, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal**:
  - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program assumes that the minimum number of consecutive elements to remove is the minimum count of elements equal to the first element. This is incorrect because the array can be beautiful even if the first element is not the one being repeated.
  - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will incorrectly count the first three `3`s and output `3`, but the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three elements).

- **Handling of Consecutive Elements**:
  - The program should consider all possible consecutive elements, not just those equal to the first element. It needs to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the array being beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
- **Identify Consecutive Patterns**:
  - The program should identify all consecutive patterns in the array and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break these patterns.
  - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program should consider the pattern `[3, 3, 3]` and `[3, 3, 3]` and determine that removing any three elements from either pattern will make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
- The current program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:
**False**
