### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately. This part of the program is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Checking for Identical Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any element is different from the previous one. If all elements are the same, the array is considered beautiful, and the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized. This is a good approach to finding the minimum value.
   - The program then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`val`). When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers consecutive elements equal to the first element (`arr[0]`). This is incorrect because the array can be beautiful even if the first element is not the one being repeated. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will incorrectly count the first three `3`s and output `3`, but the correct answer is `3` (removing any three elements from the middle or the end will make the array non-beautiful).

4. **Output**:
   - If the array is not all identical, the program outputs the minimum count of consecutive elements found, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. However, this output is based on the flawed logic of only considering consecutive elements equal to the first element.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal**:
  - The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is insufficient. The correct approach should consider all possible consecutive patterns in the array and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break these patterns.

### Correct Approach:
- **Identify Consecutive Patterns**:
  - The program should identify all consecutive patterns in the array and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break these patterns.
  - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program should consider the pattern `[3, 3, 3]` and `[3, 3, 3]` and determine that removing any three elements from either pattern will make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
- The current program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
