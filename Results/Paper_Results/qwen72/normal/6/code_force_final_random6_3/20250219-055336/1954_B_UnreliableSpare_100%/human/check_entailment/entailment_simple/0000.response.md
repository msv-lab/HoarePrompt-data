### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect. The function should take the array `arr` and its length `n` as parameters.
   - However, the function is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, and the input is handled correctly within the function itself. This means the function can still work as intended, but it is not a best practice to define it this way.

2. **Checking for All Elements Being Equal:**
   - The function uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are equal. If all elements are equal, the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the function correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Consecutive Elements to Remove:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that will be updated by the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to the first element (`val`). If a different element is found, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

4. **Output:**
   - If `flag` is `True`, it prints `-1` because the array is entirely composed of the same element.
   - If `flag` is `False`, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition:** The function `func_1` should be defined with parameters to make it more modular and clear.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The function does not handle the edge case where the array has only one element. For a single-element array, the function should print `-1` because it is impossible to make it not beautiful.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

def func_1(n, arr):
    if n == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        func_1(n, arr)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** for the logic and handling of the problem as described.
- **False** for the function definition and edge case handling.

Given the problem description and the execution states, the program is **logically correct** but has issues with function definition and edge case handling. Therefore, the overall correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
