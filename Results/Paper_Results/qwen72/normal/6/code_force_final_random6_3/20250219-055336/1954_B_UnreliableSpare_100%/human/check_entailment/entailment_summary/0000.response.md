Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If not, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element of the array and prints this minimum length.

However, there are a few issues with the logic of the program:

1. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`**: The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for initializing `ans` is unnecessary and can be simplified to a large integer like `float('inf')` or `math.inf`.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Consecutive Subarrays**: The program only checks the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element of the array. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The correct approach should involve checking all possible subarrays where the elements can be made the same by the allowed operations and then finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break this property.

3. **Handling of Beautiful Arrays**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`. However, it fails to correctly handle other cases where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

4. **Algorithmic Approach**: The algorithm should identify the longest subarray that can be made beautiful and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this property. The current approach does not do this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
