Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The correct output should be `1`, as removing the number at index 5 (0-based indexing) results in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful. However, the program will output `2` instead of `1`.

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This does not account for the possibility of removing elements that are not part of the first element's sequence, which can lead to a non-beautiful array with fewer removals.

For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the number of consecutive `1`s and `2`s, and it will find that the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element is `2`. However, removing the last `1` (at index 4) is sufficient to make the array non-beautiful, and this is not captured by the program's logic.
