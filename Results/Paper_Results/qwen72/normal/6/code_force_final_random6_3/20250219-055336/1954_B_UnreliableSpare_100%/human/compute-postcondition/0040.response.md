Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `flag` is True, indicating that all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element.
- `val` is the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the last change (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `val`).
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array, updated to be the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is very straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
- The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
