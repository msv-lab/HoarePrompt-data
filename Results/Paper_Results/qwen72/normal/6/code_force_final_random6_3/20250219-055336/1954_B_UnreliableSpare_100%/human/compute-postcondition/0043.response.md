Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array, updated to be the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is True, it indicates that all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element. If `flag` is False, it indicates that not all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element.***
