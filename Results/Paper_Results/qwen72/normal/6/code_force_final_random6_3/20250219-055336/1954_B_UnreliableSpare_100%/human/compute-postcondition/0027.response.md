Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is either 1 or 0 based on the condition `arr[i] == val`. After the increment, `cnt` will be either 1 or 2.
- The value of `ans` is the minimum value between `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`. Since `Decimal('Infinity')` is always greater than any finite number, `ans` will be equal to `cnt`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`) remain unchanged.
