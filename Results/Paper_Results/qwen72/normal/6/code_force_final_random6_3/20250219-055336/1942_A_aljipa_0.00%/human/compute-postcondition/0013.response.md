Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` equals the number of times the loop was executed, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will have the value equal to the number of times the loop ran. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers, and the list `res` will be set based on the values of `n` and `k` as follows:
- If `k` equals `n`, `res` will be a list containing `n` ones.
- If `k` equals 1, `res` will be a list containing the range of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `res` will be a list containing `-1`.
