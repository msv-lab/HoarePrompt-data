Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `res` is a list:
  - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k == 1`, `res` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `res` based on the conditions:**
   - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 5`, then `res = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - If `k == 1`, `res` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 1`, then `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, then `res = [-1]`.

2. **Evaluate the `print` statement:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the list `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - If `res` is a list of `n` ones, it will print `1 1 1 ... 1` (with `n` ones).
   - If `res` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, it will print `0 1 2 ... (n-1)`.
   - If `res` is a list containing `-1`, it will print `-1`.

### Final Output:
- If `k == n`, the output will be a sequence of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (if k == n), 0 1 2 ... (n-1) (if k == 1), -1 (otherwise)**

This format clearly describes the possible outputs based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
