The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly tracked, it is implicitly incremented by 1 with each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 2, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`**
