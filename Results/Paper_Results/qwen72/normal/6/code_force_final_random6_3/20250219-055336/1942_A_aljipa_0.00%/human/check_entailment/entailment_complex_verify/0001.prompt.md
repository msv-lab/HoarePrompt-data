You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should return a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9, that satisfies the given conditions, or -1 if no such array exists.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are input integers, `t` equals the number of times the loop was executed, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. The function then prints a list of `n` integers: a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or a list containing `-1` if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This part is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**: If \( k = n \), it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The function correctly handles this by creating an array of `1`s of length `n` and printing it.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**: If \( k = 1 \), it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The function creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence of integers from `0` to `n-1`. This sequence is sorted, and any cyclic shift of this sequence will not be sorted except for the original sequence itself. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**: If \( k \) is neither 1 nor \( n \), the function prints `-1`. This is because the problem constraints are such that it is impossible to have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts for any \( k \) other than 1 or \( n \). The reasoning is that:
     - If \( k > 1 \) and \( k < n \), there is no way to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. This is because if more than one cyclic shift is sorted, all elements must be the same (which would make all shifts sorted, i.e., \( k = n \)), or the array must have a specific pattern that only allows one sorted shift (which would make \( k = 1 \)).

3. **Output**: The function prints the results in the correct format for each test case. For \( k = n \), it prints an array of `1`s. For \( k = 1 \), it prints the sequence generated by `range(n)`. For all other cases, it prints `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the specified cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
