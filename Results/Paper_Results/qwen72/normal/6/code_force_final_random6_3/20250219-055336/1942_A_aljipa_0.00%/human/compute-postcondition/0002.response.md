Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` are reassigned the values from the input, where each value is converted to an integer.
- The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The new values of `n` and `k` are now based on the input provided, and they must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
