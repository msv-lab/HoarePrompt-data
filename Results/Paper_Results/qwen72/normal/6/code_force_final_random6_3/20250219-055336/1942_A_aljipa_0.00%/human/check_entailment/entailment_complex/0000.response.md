Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, which are the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**: If `k` is equal to `n`, the function creates an array of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of `n` identical elements will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**: If `k` is equal to 1, the function creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. This is also correct because the only sorted cyclic shift of this array is the array itself, and all other cyclic shifts will be unsorted.
   - **Case 3: Neither `k == n` nor `k == 1`**: The function outputs `-1`. This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for other values of `k` as well, not just `k == n` or `k == 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is correct.
   - However, the logic for handling cases where `k` is neither `n` nor `1` is flawed. The function should generate a valid array or determine that no such array exists, rather than always outputting `-1`.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `2 2`, the function correctly outputs `1 1`.
   - For the test case `3 1`, the function correctly outputs `0 1 2`.
   - For the test case `3 2`, the function incorrectly outputs `-1` when a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`.

Given the above reasoning, the function is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where `k` is neither `n` nor `1` properly.

Correctness: **False**
