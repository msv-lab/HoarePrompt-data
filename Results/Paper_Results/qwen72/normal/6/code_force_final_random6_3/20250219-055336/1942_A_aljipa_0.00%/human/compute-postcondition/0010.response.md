Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 2, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**

The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The condition that `t` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged. The list `res` retains its initial state based on the conditions provided: it is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise it is a list containing `-1`.
