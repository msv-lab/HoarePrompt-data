Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is true and `arr[2]` is negative, `max_segment` is either `[arr[1] + arr[2], 1]` or `[arr[1], 1]` depending on the initial value of `max_segment`, `new_segment` is an empty list, and `segments_variants` includes the initial `max_segment` plus the value `[1]` at the end. If `new_segment` is true and `arr[2]` is non-negative, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`, and `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged. If `new_segment` is false and `arr[2]` is non-negative, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`, `new_segment` is `[arr[2], 2]`, and `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described. If `new_segment` is false and `arr[2]` is negative, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`, and `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.**
