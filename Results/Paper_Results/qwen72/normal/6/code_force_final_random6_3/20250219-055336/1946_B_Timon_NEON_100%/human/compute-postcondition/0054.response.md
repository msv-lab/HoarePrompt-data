Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment, and `segments_variants` now includes an additional list: `max_segment` + [len(arr) - 1].** 

In natural language: The `segments_variants` list now contains an additional list, which is the `max_segment` list appended with the value `len(arr) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
