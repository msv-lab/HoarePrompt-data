Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `arr[1]` is negative, `new_segment` is an empty list. Otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[1]`. `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described.**
