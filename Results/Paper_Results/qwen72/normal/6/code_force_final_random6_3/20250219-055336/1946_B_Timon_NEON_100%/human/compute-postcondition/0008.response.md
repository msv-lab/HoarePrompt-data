Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`, `max_sum` is -1, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, and the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`.**
