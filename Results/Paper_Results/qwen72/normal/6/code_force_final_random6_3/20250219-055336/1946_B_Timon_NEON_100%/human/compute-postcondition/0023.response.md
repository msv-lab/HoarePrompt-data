Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, and `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_segment[0]` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to it.
- Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is `arr[0]`.
- Initially, `max_segment` is [0, 0].
- After the execution of the code, `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0]` + 0, which is `arr[0]`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.
