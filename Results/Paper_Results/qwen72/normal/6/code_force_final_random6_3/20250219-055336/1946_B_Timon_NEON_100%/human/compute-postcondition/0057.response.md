To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which is `segments_variants`. The loop will execute if `segments_variants` is not empty. Let's break down the given state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr).
- `i` is len(arr) - 1.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `new_segment` is an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment.
- `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment.
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment.
- `segments_variants` now includes an additional list: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1].
- `total_max_segment` is [-1].

For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must not be empty. Given the state, `segments_variants` includes an additional list: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1]. Therefore, `segments_variants` must contain at least one element, which is `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1].

To ensure this, we need to adjust the state of `new_segment` and `segments_variants`:

- `new_segment` must be a valid list, either empty or containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment.
- `segments_variants` must include at least one element, which is `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1].

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must include at least one element: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1], `total_max_segment` is [-1]**
