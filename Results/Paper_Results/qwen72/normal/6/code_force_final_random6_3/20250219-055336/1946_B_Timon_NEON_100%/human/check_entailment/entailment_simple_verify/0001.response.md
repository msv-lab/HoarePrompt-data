### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is a simple and correct implementation for the modulo operation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**:
   - The function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array `arr`.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are not properly initialized. `new_segment` should be initialized as an empty list, and `max_segment` should be initialized to handle the maximum sum correctly.
     - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is incorrect and does not handle all cases. Specifically, the function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are negative.
   - A correct approach to find the maximum sum subarray would be to use Kadane's algorithm, which is not implemented here.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - It then calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem statement.
   - The correct approach would involve:
     - Finding the maximum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
     - If the maximum sum subarray is non-negative, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert this sum `k` times.
     - If the maximum sum subarray is negative, the optimal strategy is to insert the sum of the entire array `k` times, which is equivalent to doing nothing since the sum of the array remains the same.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program lacks a correct implementation of the maximum sum subarray finding logic.
   - The formula used to calculate the final sum is incorrect and does not simulate the operations as required by the problem statement.
   - The `func_3` function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation, which is not used in the main program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum sum subarray and does not handle the operations as required by the problem statement. The main logic for calculating the final sum is also flawed.

Final: **False**
