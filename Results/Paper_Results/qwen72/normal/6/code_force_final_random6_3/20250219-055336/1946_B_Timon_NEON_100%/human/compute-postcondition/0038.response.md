Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is true and `arr[1]` is negative, `new_segment` is an empty list. If `new_segment` is true and `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is false and `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1]. If `new_segment` is false and `arr[1]` is negative, `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged. `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described.***
