### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is a simple and correct implementation for the modulo operation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array `arr`.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are not properly initialized.
     - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is incorrect and does not handle all cases.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
   - A correct approach to find the maximum sum subarray would be to use Kadane's algorithm, which is not implemented here.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation.
   - It is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is not implemented.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program lacks a main function or any logic to process the input and output the results.
   - The `func_2` function, which is supposed to find the maximum sum subarray, is incorrect.
   - The `func_3` function, which is supposed to handle the operations, is not implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum sum subarray and does not handle the operations as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
