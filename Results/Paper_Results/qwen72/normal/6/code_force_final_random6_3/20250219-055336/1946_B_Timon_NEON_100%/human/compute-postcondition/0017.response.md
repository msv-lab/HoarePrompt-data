Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list where the first element is increased by `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.**
