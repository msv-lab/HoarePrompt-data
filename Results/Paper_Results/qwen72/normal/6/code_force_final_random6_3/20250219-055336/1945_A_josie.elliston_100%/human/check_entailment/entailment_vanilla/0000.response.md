### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must be alone in a tent.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (0, 1, or 2).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts to form a complete tent, so it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No participants (`0 0 0`)**: The function correctly returns 0.
   - **Case 2: Only introverts (`7 0 0`)**: The function correctly returns 7.
   - **Case 3: Only extroverts (`0 24 0`)**: The function correctly returns 8.
   - **Case 4: Only universals (`0 0 18`)**: The function correctly returns 6 (since 18 universals can be divided into 6 tents of 3 each).
   - **Case 5: Impossible scenario (`1 4 1`)**: The function correctly returns -1 because one extrovert will be left without a complete tent.

5. **General Cases:**
   - **Case 1: `1 2 3`**: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals. Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 2: `1 4 2`**: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals. Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 3: `1 3 2`**: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals. Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 4: `19 7 18`**: 19 tents for the introverts, 7 tents for the extroverts (each tent with 2 universals), and 4 tents for the remaining 4 universals. Total: 28 tents.

6. **Mathematical Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the division and checks for the impossibility condition.
   - The function `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. It respects the constraints and preferences of the participants and calculates the minimum number of tents needed.

**Correctness: True**
