### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and the number of universals is at least 3. If this condition is not met, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - If the condition is met, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is the main function that calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
   - It first calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and thus `func_2` returns -1.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, `func_2` adds the number of introverts to this value and returns the total number of tents needed.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the extroverts and universals can be accommodated according to their preferences, and `func_2` correctly accounts for the introverts who need individual tents.

### Verification against the Problem Description:
- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, which is correctly handled by adding the number of introverts to the result.
- **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. The function `func_1` checks if this is possible and returns the appropriate number of tents or `None` if it is impossible.
- **Universals**: Universals can be placed in any tent configuration, which is correctly handled by the ceiling calculation in `func_1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Introverts**: The program correctly returns the number of introverts as the total number of tents.
- **All Extroverts**: The program correctly returns the ceiling of the number of extroverts divided by 3.
- **All Universals**: The program correctly returns the ceiling of the number of universals divided by 3.
- **Mixed Cases**: The program correctly handles mixed cases by ensuring that extroverts can be accommodated and then adding the number of introverts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed for the participants based on their preferences. It handles all edge cases and meets the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
