### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - **Introverts**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or output -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - **Condition 1**: If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form complete groups of 3. In this case, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - **Condition 2**: If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts. This makes it impossible to accommodate all extroverts, so the function returns `None`.
   - **Return Value**: If the above conditions are not met, the function returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - **Step 1**: Call `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
   - **Step 2**: If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals, so the function returns `-1`.
   - **Step 3**: If `func_1` returns a valid number of tents, add the number of introverts to this value and return the result. This is because each introvert needs a separate tent.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - **Function 1**:
     - The condition `if (extroverts % 3 != 0)` checks if there are any extroverts that cannot form complete groups of 3.
     - The condition `if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3)` ensures that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent.
     - The return value `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - **Function 2**:
     - The function correctly calls `func_1` and handles the `None` return value by outputting `-1`.
     - The function correctly adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal = 1 tent
     - Remaining universals: 2 universals = 1 tent
     - Total tents: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - **Case 2**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 4/3 = 1.33 tents, but since we can't have a fraction of a tent, we need 2 tents. However, we only have 1 universal, which is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the second tent.
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Case 3**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 2 tents
     - Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3
   - **Case 4**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1/3 = 0.33 tents, but we need 1 tent. We have 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent.
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Case 5**: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts + 2 universals = 1 tent
     - Total tents: 1 + 1 = 3
   - **Case 6**: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`
     - Introverts: 19 tents
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 25 people, which can be accommodated in 25/3 = 8.33 tents, rounded up to 9 tents.
     - Total tents: 19 + 9 = 28
   - **Case 7**: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
   - **Case 8**: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`
     - Introverts: 7 tents
     - No extroverts or universals, so 7 tents.
   - **Case 9**: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`
     - Extroverts: 24 extroverts = 24/3 = 8 tents
     - No introverts or universals, so 8 tents.
   - **Case 10**: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals = 2000000000 people, which can be accommodated in 2000000000/3 = 666666666.67 tents, rounded up to 666666667 tents.
     - Total tents: 1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles the logic for determining the number of tents needed for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It correctly returns `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
   - The program also handles edge cases and large inputs correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**
