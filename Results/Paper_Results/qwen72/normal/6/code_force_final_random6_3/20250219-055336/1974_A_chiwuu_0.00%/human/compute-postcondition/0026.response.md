Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1.**

The code snippet `b = int(b)` does not change the value of `b` because `b` is already an integer. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
