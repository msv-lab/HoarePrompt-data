Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`, so the initial state remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions are still valid as they were in the initial state.
