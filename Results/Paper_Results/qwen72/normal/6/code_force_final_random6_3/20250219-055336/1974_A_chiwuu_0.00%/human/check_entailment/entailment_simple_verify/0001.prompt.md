You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

        print(t)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all `n` iterations, `i` is `n-1`, and `t` is updated based on the final values of `a` and `b` from the last iteration. If `t % 5 == 0`, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is set to `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), the program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - The calculation `t = b * 2` is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 2 cells in a 5x3 grid (since 4 cells / 2 cells per row = 2 rows).
   - The program then checks if `t` is divisible by 5 (the number of rows in a screen). If it is, it divides `t` by 5 to get the number of screens. If not, it adds 1 to account for the partial screen.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens already used by the 2x2 icons as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Sufficient for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the program does not need to add any more screens.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation `t2 = a - t1` is correct, as it determines how many more 1x1 icons need to be placed.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15 (the total number of cells in a screen). If it is, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. If not, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the partial screen.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they are sufficient for 1x1 icons is also correct.
- The logic for calculating additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is correct.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses `t = b * 2` to calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. This is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 2 rows, and each screen has 5 rows.
- The program correctly handles the case where the remaining cells are not sufficient for all 1x1 icons by calculating the additional screens needed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**True**
