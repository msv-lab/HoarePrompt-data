### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), the program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - The calculation `t = b * 2` is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 2 cells in a 5x3 grid (since 4 cells / 2 cells per row = 2 rows).
   - The program then checks if `t` is divisible by 5 (the number of rows in a screen). If it is, it divides `t` by 5 to get the number of screens. If not, it adds 1 to account for the partial screen.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens already used by the 2x2 icons as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Sufficient for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the program does not need to add any more screens.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation `t2 = a - t1` is correct, as it determines how many more 1x1 icons need to be placed.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15 (the total number of cells in a screen). If it is, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. If not, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the partial screen.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they are sufficient for 1x1 icons is also correct.
- The logic for calculating additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is correct.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses `t = b * 2` to calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. This is correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 2 rows, and each screen has 5 rows.
- The program correctly handles the case where the remaining cells are not sufficient for all 1x1 icons by calculating the additional screens needed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**True**
