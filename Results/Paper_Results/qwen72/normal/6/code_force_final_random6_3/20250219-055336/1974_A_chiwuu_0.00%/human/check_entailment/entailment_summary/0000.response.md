Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initially set to `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid has 15 cells per screen (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The function then calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons by dividing `t` by 5 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is correct because each screen can hold 3 of the 2x2 icons (since 3 * 4 = 12 cells are used, leaving 3 cells free).

3. **Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` (remaining cells) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), the function does not need to add more screens, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the function calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by calculating `t2 = a - t1` and then determining how many more screens are needed by dividing `t2` by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case, which is the final value of `t`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where `a` or `b` are zero correctly.
   - The function also handles cases where only 1x1 icons are present or only 2x2 icons are present.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `(1, 1)`, the function correctly calculates that one screen is enough.
   - For the test case `(12, 4)`, the function correctly calculates that two screens are needed.
   - For the test case `(0, 9)`, the function correctly calculates that five screens are needed.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
