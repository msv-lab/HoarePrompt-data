The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user. If `t` was divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains as calculated. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, and `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
