The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the first and second values input by the user, respectively. `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, the program retains the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `t1` as described. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.**
