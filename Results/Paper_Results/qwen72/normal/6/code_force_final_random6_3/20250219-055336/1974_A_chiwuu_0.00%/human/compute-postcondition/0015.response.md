Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t1` is less than `a`. `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, with the addition that `t2` is now equal to the difference between `a` and `t1`. The value of `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is the result of subtracting `t1` from `a`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
