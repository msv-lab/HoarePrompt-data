Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `t` for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t` as the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by dividing `b * 2` by 5 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid is 5x3 (15 cells per screen). The correct way to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is to divide `b * 4` by 15 and add 1 if there is a remainder.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct, but the subsequent logic to handle the 1x1 icons is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screens when placing the 1x1 icons.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons by dividing `t2` by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is incorrect because it does not consider the remaining space on the already used screens. It should first try to place the 1x1 icons on the existing screens before calculating the need for additional screens.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_space >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_space
            additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` ensures that we round up the division to account for any remaining cells that would require an additional screen.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Space**:
   - `remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4` calculates the total number of cells available on the screens minus the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculate the Number of Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is enough to place all the 1x1 icons, `total_screens` is just `screens_for_2x2`.
   - If not, `remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_space` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, and `additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15` calculates the number of additional screens needed, ensuring we round up the division.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for all test cases.
