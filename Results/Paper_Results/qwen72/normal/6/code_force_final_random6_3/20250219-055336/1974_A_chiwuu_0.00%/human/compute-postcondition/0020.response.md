Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, with `t1` being less than `a` and `t2` equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, with `t1` being less than `a` and `t2` equal to `a - t1`.***
