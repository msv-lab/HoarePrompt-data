Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1.**

The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` updates the variables `a` and `b` to the values provided by the user. These values are split from the input string and converted to integers. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged. The specific values of `a` and `b` are now the first and second values input by the user, respectively.
