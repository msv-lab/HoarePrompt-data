Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
