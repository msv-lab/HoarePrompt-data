Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged.
- The expression `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` is the value of `t2`.
- The new value of `t` is the original `t` plus the integer division of `t2` by 15.
