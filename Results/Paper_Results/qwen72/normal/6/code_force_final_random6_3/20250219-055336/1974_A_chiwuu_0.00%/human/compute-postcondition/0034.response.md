Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `t1` and `t2` are still defined as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2 = a - t1`, respectively. However, since `t` has been updated, `t1` and `t2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `t` if they are used again.
