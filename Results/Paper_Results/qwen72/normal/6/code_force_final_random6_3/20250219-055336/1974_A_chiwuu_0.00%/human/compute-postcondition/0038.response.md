Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine the value of `t` that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers representing the first and second values input by the user, respectively.
- `t` is updated based on the value of `b`:
  - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = b * 2 // 5`.
  - Otherwise, `t = b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

### Logic:
1. **Calculate `t1`**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

2. **Check if `t1 >= a`**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `t1` remain as described.
   - If `t1 < a`, then:
     - Calculate `t2` as `t2 = a - t1`.
     - Check if `t2 % 15 == 0`:
       - If true, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.
       - If false, update `t` to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial Calculation of `t`**:
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = b * 2 // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t = b * 2 // 5 + 1`.

2. **Calculate `t1`**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Check `t1 >= a`**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, the value of `t` remains as calculated initially.
   - If `t1 < a`, then:
     - Calculate `t2 = a - t1`.
     - Check `t2 % 15`:
       - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.
       - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, update `t` to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `t` will be printed.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t` is initially determined based on the input `b` and the condition `t % 5 == 0`.
- `t1` is then calculated using the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- Depending on whether `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` may be updated further.
- If `t1 < a`, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and `t` is updated based on the value of `t2 % 15`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the given logic, the value of `t` will be the final updated value after the conditions are checked and applied.

Output: **t (where t is the final value of t after the conditions are checked and applied)**
