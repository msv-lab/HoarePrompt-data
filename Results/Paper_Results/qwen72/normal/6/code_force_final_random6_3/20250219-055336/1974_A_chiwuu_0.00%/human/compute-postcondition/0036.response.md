Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers representing the first and second values input by the user, respectively. `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.***
