Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `n` test cases, where `n` is an integer provided by the user. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input. It calculates a value `t` based on `b` and updates `t` to ensure that `t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. The final value of `t` for each test case is printed. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variables `a`, `b`, and `t` are no longer relevant, and the function concludes. **
