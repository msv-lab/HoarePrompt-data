Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18

# Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer from the user input, which represents the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `x` from the user input, where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and prints `x - 1`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of iterations completed and the printed values, which are each one less than the corresponding input integers.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
