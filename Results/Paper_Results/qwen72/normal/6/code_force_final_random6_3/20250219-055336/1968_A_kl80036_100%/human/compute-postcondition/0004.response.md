The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the range for the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `y` is `x - 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1 and the range must still be greater than 0.

However, the range is determined by the user input, which is not a variable that changes within the loop. Therefore, the user input remains the same, and the only variable that changes is `i`.

State: **`x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
