Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer where \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

When the `print(y)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Since `x` is an integer within the range 2 to 1000, `y` will be an integer within the range 1 to 999.

Output: **y (where y is the value of x - 1, and x is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive)**
