Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct for the problem description. The program iterates through each test case, and for each integer \( x \), it sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints \( y \).

The reasoning behind this is:
- The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y = x - 1 \) is always 1, because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their gcd is 1).
- Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x \), which is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) given the constraint \( 1 \le y < x \).

Thus, the program correctly finds and prints a valid \( y \) for each test case.
