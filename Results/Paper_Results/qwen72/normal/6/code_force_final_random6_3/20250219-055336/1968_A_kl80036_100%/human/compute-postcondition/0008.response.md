The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the input from `input()`. The loop condition depends on `i` being less than the value provided by `input()`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and the input value is `x`, where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and the input value must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `y` is `x - 1`**
