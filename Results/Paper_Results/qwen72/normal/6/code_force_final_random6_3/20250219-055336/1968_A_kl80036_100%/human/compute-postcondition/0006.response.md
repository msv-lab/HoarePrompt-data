Output State: **`x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**

The code snippet `y = x - 1` reassigns the value of `y` to be `x - 1`. Since `x` is an input integer with a value between 2 and 1000, `y` will be one less than `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state is `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, and `y` is `x - 1`.
