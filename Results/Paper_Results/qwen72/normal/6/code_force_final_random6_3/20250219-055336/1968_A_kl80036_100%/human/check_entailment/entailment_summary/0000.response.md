Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided always outputs \( y = x - 1 \). Let's analyze why this is a correct approach:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1, because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

2. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

3. **Comparison with Other Possible \( y \) Values**:
   - For any other \( y \) where \( 1 \le y < x \), the value of \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be at most \( \frac{x}{2} \) (since \( y \) is less than \( x \)).
   - However, even if \( \gcd(x, y) \) is greater than 1, the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be less than \( x \) because \( y \) is less than \( x - 1 \).

Thus, \( y = x - 1 \) always maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because it results in the maximum possible value of \( x \).

Given the execution summary, the program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and prints \( x - 1 \). This behavior aligns with the problem statement and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
