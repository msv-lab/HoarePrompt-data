It seems there is a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description suggests that the function should take an integer `n` as input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. I will correct the function definition to match the problem description and then provide the precondition.

Corrected function definition:
```python
def func_1(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**
