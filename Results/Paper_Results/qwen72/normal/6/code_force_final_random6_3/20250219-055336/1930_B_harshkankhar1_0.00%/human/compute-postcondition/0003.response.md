The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraint, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
