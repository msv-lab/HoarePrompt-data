Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from user input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and prints the modified list. The final state of the program is that the list `a` is printed, where the elements at even indices are swapped with the elements at the next odd indices, and the last element remains unchanged if `n` is odd. **
