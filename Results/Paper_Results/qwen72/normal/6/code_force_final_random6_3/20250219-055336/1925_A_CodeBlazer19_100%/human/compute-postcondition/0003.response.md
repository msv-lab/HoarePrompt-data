To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a string containing the first 26 lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
   - `[:k]` slices the string from the beginning up to (but not including) the index `k`. This means it will take the first `k` characters of the string.
   - `* n` repeats the sliced string `n` times.
   - The `print` statement will output the resulting string.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `k` determines how many characters are taken from the beginning of the alphabet string.
   - The value of `n` determines how many times this substring is repeated.

Since `k` and `n` are input integers, we can't determine their exact values without specific inputs. However, we can describe the output based on the given information:

- If `k` is 3 and `n` is 2, the output will be `abcabc`.
- If `k` is 5 and `n` is 3, the output will be `abcdeabcdeabcde`.

Therefore, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **The first `k` characters of the alphabet string repeated `n` times (where `k` is the number of characters taken from the beginning of the alphabet string and `n` is the number of times the substring is repeated)**
