The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676), which represents the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The function processes each test case and returns the results for each case.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from stdin, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from stdin, processes them, and returns the results for each test case.**
