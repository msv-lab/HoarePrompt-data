Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676, inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.** 

The initial state variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. Therefore, `n` and `k` now hold the input integer values.
