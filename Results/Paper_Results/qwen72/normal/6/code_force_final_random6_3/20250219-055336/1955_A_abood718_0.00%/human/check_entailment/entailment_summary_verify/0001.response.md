### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the given program.

#### Problem Description:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is \( b \) burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy \( n \) yogurts.

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes \( t \) test cases, where \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \).
- For each test case, it reads three integers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) such that \( 1 \le A, B, C \le 30 \).
- The function prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions:
  - If \( B \times 2 < C \), it prints \( A \times B \).
  - If \( A \% 2 == 0 \), it prints \( \text{int}(A \times C / 2) \).
  - If \( A \) is odd and \( B \times 2 \ge C \), it prints two lines: \( X = A // 2 \) and \( X \times C + B \).

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the program:
  - **Incorrect Output for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
    - The program prints \( X \) (the number of pairs) before printing the actual cost, which is incorrect.
    - The correct output should only be the total cost, not the number of pairs.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Explanation:
- **If \( B \times 2 < C \):**
  - The regular price for two yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is \( A \times B \).
- **If \( A \% 2 == 0 \):**
  - The number of yogurts is even, so the total cost is \( \frac{A \times C}{2} \).
- **Otherwise:**
  - The number of yogurts is odd, so the total cost is \( X \times C + B \), where \( X = \frac{A}{2} \) (integer division).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the program. The program indeed prints an extra value \( X \) when the number of yogurts is odd, which is incorrect. The corrected program provided in the original assessment is the correct solution.

Final: **False**
