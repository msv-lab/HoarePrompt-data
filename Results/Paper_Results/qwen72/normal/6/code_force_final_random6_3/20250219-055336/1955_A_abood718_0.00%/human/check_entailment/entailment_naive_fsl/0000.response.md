Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd and the promotion price `C` is more advantageous than the regular price `B` for buying two yogurts. Specifically, the program prints an extra line with the value of `X` (the number of pairs of yogurts), which is not required by the problem description. Additionally, the calculation for the total cost when `A` is odd is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 5 9
```
The expected output is `14` (buy one yogurt at the regular price and one pair at the promotion price). However, the program outputs:
```
1
14
```
The extra line `1` is not part of the expected output, and this violates the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
