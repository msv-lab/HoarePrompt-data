Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the input integers.
- `int(input())` is greater than 2.

### Conditions:
1. If `B * 2 < C`, then `X` is not set.
2. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, then `X` is not set.
3. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, then `X` is set to `A // 2`.

### Task:
Determine what will be printed by the `print(A * B)` statement.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Values:**
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user.
   - `int(input())` is greater than 2, so `A`, `B`, and `C` are all integers greater than 2.

2. **Conditions for `X`:**
   - The value of `X` depends on the conditions involving `A`, `B`, and `C`.
   - However, the `print(A * B)` statement does not involve `X` or `C` directly. It only involves `A` and `B`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.
   - Since `A` and `B` are both integers greater than 2, the product `A * B` will be a positive integer.

### Conclusion:
The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of the integers `A` and `B`, where both `A` and `B` are greater than 2.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers greater than 2)**
