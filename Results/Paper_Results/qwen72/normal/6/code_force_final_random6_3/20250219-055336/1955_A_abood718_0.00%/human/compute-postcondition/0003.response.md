The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of the integers `A` and `B`. 

- `A` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.
- `B` is also an integer, and its specific value is not provided in the initial state.
- The initial state mentions that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but this input is not used in the `print` statement.
- The condition `B * 2 < C` is given, which means that `B` is less than half of `C`, but this does not affect the value of `A * B` directly.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided, the output will be the product of these two integers.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers, and B is less than half of C)**
