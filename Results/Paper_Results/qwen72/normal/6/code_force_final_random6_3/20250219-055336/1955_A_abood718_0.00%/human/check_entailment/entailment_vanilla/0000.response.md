Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is \( b \) burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy \( n \) yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to variables \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - **If \( B \times 2 < C \):**
     - This condition checks if the regular price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion price.
     - If true, the program prints \( A \times B \), which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - **If \( A \% 2 == 0 \):**
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts \( A \) is even.
     - If true, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - If the number of yogurts \( A \) is odd, the program calculates \( X = A // 2 \), which is the number of pairs of yogurts.
     - It then prints \( X \) (which is not the correct output) and \( X \times C + B \), which is the total cost for buying \( X \) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - The program prints \( X \) (the number of pairs) before printing the actual cost, which is incorrect.
  - The correct output should only be the total cost, not the number of pairs.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Explanation:
- **If \( B \times 2 < C \):**
  - The regular price for two yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is \( A \times B \).
- **If \( A \% 2 == 0 \):**
  - The number of yogurts is even, so the total cost is \( \frac{A \times C}{2} \).
- **Otherwise:**
  - The number of yogurts is odd, so the total cost is \( X \times C + B \), where \( X = \frac{A}{2} \) (integer division).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it prints an extra value \( X \) when the number of yogurts is odd. The corrected program should only print the total cost.

Correctness: **False**
