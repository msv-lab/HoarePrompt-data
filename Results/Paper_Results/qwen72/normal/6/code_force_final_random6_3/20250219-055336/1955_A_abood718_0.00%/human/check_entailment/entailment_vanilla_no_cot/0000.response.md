Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the cost when the number of yogurts to be bought is odd. Specifically, the line `print(X)` should not be there, and the final calculation for the odd case is incorrect. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            X = n // 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print(X * b)
            else:
                print(X * b + a)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Price Comparison**: It checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion price (`2 * a < b`).
3. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts is even, it calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buys the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

The original code incorrectly prints the number of pairs (`X`) and then calculates the cost incorrectly for the odd case. The corrected code ensures that the total cost is calculated correctly for both even and odd numbers of yogurts.
