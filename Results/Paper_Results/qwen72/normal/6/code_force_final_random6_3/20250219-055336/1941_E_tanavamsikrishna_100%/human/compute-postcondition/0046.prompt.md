You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers where row[0] and row[-1] are initially 0, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` must be greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d-1`.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is equal to the length of `row`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first `d` elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[j], j)` for `j` from `d` to the length of `row` - 1 have been added to the heap. Each element in `row` from `row[d]` to `row[-2]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[j] + 1` where `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and did not satisfy the loop condition.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It always returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
