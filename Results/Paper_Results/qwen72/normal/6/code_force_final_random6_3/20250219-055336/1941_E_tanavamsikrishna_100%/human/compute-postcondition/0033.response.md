To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `e`: The result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which is a tuple containing the value and index of the smallest element in the min-heap.
   - `min_heap`: The min-heap from which `e` is popped.
   - `i`: The current index.
   - `d`: The dimension parameter.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
   - `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
   - `i` is `d + 6`.
   - `min_heap` contains the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap. The tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
   - `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition.
   - `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - We need to ensure that the index of the element popped from `min_heap` (i.e., `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is `d + 6`.
   - `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.

5. **Calculation:**
   - `i - (d + 2) = (d + 6) - (d + 2) = 4`.

6. **Heap Content:**
   - `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed.
   - The tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
   - Therefore, the smallest index in `min_heap` must be at least `3` (since the first three elements were removed).

7. **Ensuring the Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, the smallest index in `min_heap` (i.e., `e[1]`) must be less than or equal to `4`.
   - Since the smallest index in `min_heap` is at least `3`, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in `min_heap` with an index of `3` or `4`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is satisfied, we need to ensure that the smallest index in `min_heap` is `3` or `4`. Given the initial state, this is already possible because the smallest index in `min_heap` is at least `3`.

### Final State:
State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d + 6`; `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`**.
