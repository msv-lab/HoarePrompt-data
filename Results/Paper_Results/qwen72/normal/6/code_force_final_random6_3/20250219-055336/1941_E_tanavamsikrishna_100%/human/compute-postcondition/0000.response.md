Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four integers read from the standard input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The next `n` lines of input are expected to contain `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last columns being 0.**
