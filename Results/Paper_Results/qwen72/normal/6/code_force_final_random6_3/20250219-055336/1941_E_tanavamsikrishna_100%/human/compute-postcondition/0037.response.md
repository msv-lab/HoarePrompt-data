To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
- The loop will continue to execute as long as the index of the element `e` (popped from `min_heap`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Current State:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is `d + 6`.
- `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
- `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition.
- `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **`e` and `min_heap`**:
   - `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which means `e` is the smallest element in the heap along with its index.
   - The loop condition depends on `e[1]` (the index of the element `e`).

2. **`i`**:
   - `i` is `d + 6`.
   - The loop condition also depends on `i`.

3. **`d`**:
   - `d` is a fixed value greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.

### Loop Condition Simplification:
- The loop condition is `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
- Substituting `i` with `d + 6`, the condition becomes `e[1] <= (d + 6) - (d + 2)`.
- Simplifying further, `e[1] <= 4`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 4.
- Since `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, the smallest index in `min_heap` must be less than or equal to 4.

### Current State of `min_heap`:
- `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed.
- The tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
- Given `i` is `d + 6`, the indices added to the heap are `d + 5` and `d + 6`.

### Conclusion:
- The smallest index in `min_heap` must be less than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
- Since `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, and the first three elements and their indices have been removed, the smallest index in `min_heap` is `3` (assuming `d >= 4`).

### Final State:
- The smallest index in `min_heap` is `3`, which is less than or equal to 4.
- Therefore, the loop condition `e[1] <= 4` is satisfied, and the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d + 6`; `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`**.
