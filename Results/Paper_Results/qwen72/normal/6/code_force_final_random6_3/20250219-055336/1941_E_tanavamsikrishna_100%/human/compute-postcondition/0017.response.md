Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than `d + 2`; `min_heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap.**

### Explanation:
- **`row`**: The list `row` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify the elements of `row`.
- **`d`**: The value of `d` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`min_heap`**: The loop removes elements from the min-heap `min_heap` as long as the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is true. After the first three iterations, the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap. The remaining elements in the heap are still a valid min-heap, but the first three elements are no longer present.
