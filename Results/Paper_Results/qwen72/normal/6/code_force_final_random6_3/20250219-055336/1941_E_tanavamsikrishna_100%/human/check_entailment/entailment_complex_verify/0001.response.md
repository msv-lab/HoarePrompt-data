### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It starts by setting the cost of the first cell to 1 (since a support must be installed there).
   - It then iterates through the first `d` cells, adding 2 to the cost of each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the installation cost).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the cells within the sliding window of size `d`.
   - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it ensures that the distance between the current cell and the nearest support is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then adds the cost of the current cell to the minimum cost from the heap, and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost for the entire row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid (a list of `n` rows, each with `m` cells).
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the sum of `n * m` does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
   - The function correctly installs supports in the first and last columns.
   - The function ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

5. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for each cell is efficiently calculated.
   - The sliding window approach with the heap is appropriate for maintaining the minimum cost within the required distance `d`.
   - The function correctly sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

6. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the output is printed as required.
   - The function handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Initial Setup:**
  - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first cell to 1, which is correct because a support must be installed there.
  - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This increases the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 2, which is correct because each cell in this range must have a support and the installation cost is 1.

- **Heap Initialization:**
  - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This initializes the heap with the first `d` cells, which is correct.
  - `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a min-heap, which is correct.

- **Main Loop:**
  - `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This loop iterates over the remaining cells in the row.
  - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This ensures that the distance between the current cell and the nearest support is no more than `d` by removing elements from the heap that are too far away. The condition `i - (d + 2)` is correct because the distance is `|j_1 - j_2| - 1`.
  - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the installation cost. This is correct.
  - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This pushes the minimum element back into the heap, which is correct.
  - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the updated cost of the current cell into the heap, which is correct.

- **Final Return:**
  - `return row[-1]`: This returns the cost of the last cell, which is the total minimum cost for the row. This is correct.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Input Reading:**
  - `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, which is correct.
  - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This reads the river grid, which is correct.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, which is correct.

- **Total Cost Calculation:**
  - `total_costs = []`: This initializes an empty list to store the total costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows, which is correct.
  - `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`: This loop iterates over the possible starting indices for the sets of `k` consecutive rows, which is correct.
  - `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and appends it to `total_costs`, which is correct.

- **Output:**
  - `print(min(total_costs))`: This prints the minimum total cost, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution for the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately and uses an efficient algorithm to find the minimum cost.

Final: **True**
