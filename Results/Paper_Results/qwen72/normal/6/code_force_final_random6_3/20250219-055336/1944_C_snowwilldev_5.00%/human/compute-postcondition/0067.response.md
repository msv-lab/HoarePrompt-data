Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once up to the point where the loop breaks, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `N-1` and `t` will be the number of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once. If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0 at any iteration, the loop breaks and `i` will be the index at which the loop broke.**
