Output State: **`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`, `t` is 1 if the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 1, otherwise `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Initially, `t` is 1 if the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 1, otherwise `t` is 0. After the increment, `t` will be 1 regardless of the initial condition. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `tc`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
