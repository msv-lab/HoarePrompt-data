Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`.
   - `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1**
