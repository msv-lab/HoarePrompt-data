Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`.
   - If the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 1, then `t` is 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
