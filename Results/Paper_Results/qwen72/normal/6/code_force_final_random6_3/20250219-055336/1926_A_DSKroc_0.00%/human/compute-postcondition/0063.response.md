Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input string, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` > `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.***
