You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the sum of the digits for numbers greater than 9. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` does not correctly handle the sum of the digits for multi-digit numbers. For example, for the number 100, `remainder` would be 10, and the program would treat it as a single digit, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a runtime error. 

To illustrate, consider the input `n = 100`:
- The program will incorrectly calculate the sum of the digits for 100 as `values[0] + values[10]`, which is 0 + 1 = 1, instead of the correct sum of digits 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- However, the sum of the digits for 100 should be 1, but the program will not correctly accumulate the sum for all numbers up to 100 due to the incorrect handling of multi-digit numbers.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
