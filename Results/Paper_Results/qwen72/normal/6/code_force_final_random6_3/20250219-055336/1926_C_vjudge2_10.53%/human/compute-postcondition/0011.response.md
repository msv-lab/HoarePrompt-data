Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each representing a value of `n` that was read during the loop execution.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` must still be greater than 0, as it was the condition that allowed the loop to run.
- The loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The list `numbers` will contain `t` integers, each of which was read from the input during one of the loop iterations. Each integer in the list corresponds to a value of `n` that was provided as input.
