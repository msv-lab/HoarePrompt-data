The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range object which is fixed at `range(10)`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2. The other variables and objects do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0 and `values[1]` which is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 1, `i` is 2, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**
