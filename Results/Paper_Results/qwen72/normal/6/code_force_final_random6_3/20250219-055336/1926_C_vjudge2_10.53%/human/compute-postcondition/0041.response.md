Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `sum_values[10]` is 54, `total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 9, `sum_total` is 64, `values[11]` is 10.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]` updates the value of `sum_total`.
- `i` is 11, so `values[i]` is `values[11]`, which is 10.
- `i - 1` is 10, so `sum_values[i - 1]` is `sum_values[10]`, which is 54.
- Therefore, `sum_total` becomes `10 + 54`, which is 64.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
