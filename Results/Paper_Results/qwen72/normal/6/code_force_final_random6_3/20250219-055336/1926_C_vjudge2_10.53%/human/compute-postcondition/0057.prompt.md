Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the computed values based on the loop logic. `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index. `total` is 45, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 9, and all other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers and must have at least one integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the computed values based on the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index, `total` is 45, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 9, and all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers and must have at least one integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the computed values based on the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `n` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index, `total` is 45, `i` is the next value of `n` in `numbers`, `n` is the next value of `n` in `numbers`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers and must have at least one integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to the current `n` are the computed values based on the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to the current `n` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index, `total` is 45, `i` is the next value of `n` in `numbers`, `n` is the next value of `n` in `numbers` after the current `n`, and all other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
