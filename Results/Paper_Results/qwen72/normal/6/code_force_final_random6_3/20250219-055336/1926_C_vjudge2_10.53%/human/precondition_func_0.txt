The function `func_1` should actually be defined with an input parameter `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided before the individual test cases.
