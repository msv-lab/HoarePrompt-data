### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and appends it to the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively.
   - The first 10 elements of `values` are correctly initialized to their respective digit values (0 through 9).
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is also correctly initialized for the first 10 elements.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - For numbers greater than 9, the program converts the number to a string and extracts the last digit and the remainder.
   - The sum of the digits for a number `i` is calculated as `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
   - This approach is flawed because `remainder` is treated as a single number, not as the sum of its digits. For example, for `i = 100`, `remainder` is `10`, and the program will treat it as a single digit, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values[i]` is calculated as `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.
   - This part of the code is correct and will work as long as `values[i]` is correctly calculated.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the function prints the cumulative sum up to the corresponding `n`.

### Analysis of the Logical Error:

- **Incorrect Handling of Multi-Digit Numbers:**
  - The line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` is the source of the error. For a number like 100, `remainder` is 10, and the program will incorrectly use `values[10]` instead of the sum of the digits of 10 (which is 1).
  - This error propagates to all numbers greater than 9, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:

- To correctly calculate the sum of the digits for any number, you should sum the digits of the number directly, not just the last digit and the remainder.
- A correct implementation would involve a helper function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number.

### Example of Correct Implementation:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum_of_digits(i)
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
