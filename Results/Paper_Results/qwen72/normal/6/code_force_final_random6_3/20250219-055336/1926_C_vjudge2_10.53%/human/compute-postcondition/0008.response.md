The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `_` is 1, it will be 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `numbers` is a list containing the input integers `n` and `n` (the new input integer).**
