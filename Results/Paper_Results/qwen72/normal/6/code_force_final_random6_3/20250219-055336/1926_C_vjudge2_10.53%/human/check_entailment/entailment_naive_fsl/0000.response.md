Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the sum of the digits for numbers greater than 9. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` does not correctly handle the sum of the digits for multi-digit numbers. For example, for the number 100, `remainder` would be 10, and the program would treat it as a single digit, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a runtime error. 

To illustrate, consider the input `n = 100`:
- The program will incorrectly calculate the sum of the digits for 100 as `values[0] + values[10]`, which is 0 + 1 = 1, instead of the correct sum of digits 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- However, the sum of the digits for 100 should be 1, but the program will not correctly accumulate the sum for all numbers up to 100 due to the incorrect handling of multi-digit numbers.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
