Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `max(numbers)` are the computed values based on the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, and the elements from 10 to `max(numbers)` are the cumulative sums of the `values` list up to that index, `total` is 45, `i` is the last value of `n` in `numbers`, `n` is the last value of `n` in `numbers`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `t` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains `t-1`.
- The list `numbers` still contains `t` input integers.
- The list `values` is now fully populated with computed values for indices from 10 to `max(numbers)`.
- The list `sum_values` is now fully populated with cumulative sums of the `values` list for indices from 10 to `max(numbers)`.
- The variable `total` remains 45.
- The variable `i` is the last value of `n` in the `numbers` list.
- The variable `n` is the last value of `n` in the `numbers` list.
- All other variables that were not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
