Output State: **`a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is `k // 2 - 1` if `1` is in `b` but not in `a`, otherwise `n` is `k // 2`. If `v` is `True` and `u` is `False`, `n` is decreased by 1, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if `2` is in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is `k // 2 - (u and not v) - (u and not v)`, `i` is 3, `u` is `True` if `3` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `3` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`.**
