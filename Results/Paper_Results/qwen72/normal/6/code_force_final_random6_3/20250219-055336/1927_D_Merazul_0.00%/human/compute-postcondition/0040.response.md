Output State: **`a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces and must be at least 1, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is `k // 2`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `u` is `True` if `1` is in `a` and `False` otherwise, `v` is `True` if `1` is in `b` and `False` otherwise.**
