The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is non-zero and the loop can certainly execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `R` is a function that maps input split by spaces to integers.**
