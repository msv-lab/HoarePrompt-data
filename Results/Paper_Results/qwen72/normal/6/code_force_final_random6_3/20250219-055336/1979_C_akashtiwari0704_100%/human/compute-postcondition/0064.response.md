Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[2]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`, `sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.**
