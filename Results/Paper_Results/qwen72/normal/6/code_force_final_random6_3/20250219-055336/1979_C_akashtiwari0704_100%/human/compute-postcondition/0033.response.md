The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `str(a[0])` followed by a space, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`**
