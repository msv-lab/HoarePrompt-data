Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list. The list `l` must contain at least one element, and all elements must be positive integers. After the function concludes, the return value is the LCM of the elements in `l`, and the list `l` remains unchanged. **
