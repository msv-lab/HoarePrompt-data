Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is `int(a[0])`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
- The value of `prod` remains the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.
- The value of `sumo` remains `int(a[0])`.
- The value of `ans` remains a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.
- The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.
