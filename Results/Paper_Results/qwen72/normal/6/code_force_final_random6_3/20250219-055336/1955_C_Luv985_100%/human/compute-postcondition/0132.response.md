Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - (2 * mi)`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `l` is 0, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains greater than 0, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2.***
