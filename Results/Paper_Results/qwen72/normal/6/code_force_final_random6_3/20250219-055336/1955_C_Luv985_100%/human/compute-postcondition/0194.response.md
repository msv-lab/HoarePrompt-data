Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 2, 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
