Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= n - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r <= n - 1`, `ans` is an integer such that `0 <= ans <= n + 1`, and the elements of `a` between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is updated to be within the range `0 <= ans <= n + 1`.**
