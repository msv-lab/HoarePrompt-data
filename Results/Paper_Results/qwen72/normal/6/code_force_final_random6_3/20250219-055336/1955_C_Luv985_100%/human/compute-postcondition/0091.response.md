Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (2 * mi)`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` before the updates, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, and the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r]`) is 0. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0.**
