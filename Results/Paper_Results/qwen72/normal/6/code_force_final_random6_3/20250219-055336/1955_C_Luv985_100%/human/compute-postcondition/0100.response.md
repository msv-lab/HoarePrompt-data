Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` before the updates. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - (2 * mi)`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is updated to 1, and the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r]`) is 0. If `a[l]` was 0, `l` is updated to 1, `ans` is updated to 2, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `a[l]` is equal to `t + k // 2`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
