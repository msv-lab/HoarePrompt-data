Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is no longer a string, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and the value of `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0.**
