The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `k`: Integers for each test case, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers for each test case, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the input values. Since the output is not specified, I will describe the functionality in a general sense:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.**
