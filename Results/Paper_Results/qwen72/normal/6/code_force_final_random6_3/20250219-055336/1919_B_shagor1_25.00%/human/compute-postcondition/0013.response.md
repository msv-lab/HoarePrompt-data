Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `i` is the last character of `s`, `n` is an input integer, and `neg` is the number of "-" characters in `s`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `neg` will have been incremented each time a "-" character is encountered in the string `s`. Therefore, `neg` will hold the total count of "-" characters in the string `s`. The variable `i` will be the last character of `s` when the loop finishes, and the length of `s` and the input integer `n` remain unchanged.
