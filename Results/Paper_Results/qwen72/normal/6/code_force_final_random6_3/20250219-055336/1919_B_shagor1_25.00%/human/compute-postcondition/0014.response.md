Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-".
   - `i` is the last character of `s`.
   - `n` is an input integer representing the length of the string `s`.
   - `neg` is the number of "-" characters in `s`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The expression `n - 2 * neg` is used if `n` is not equal to `neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the expression simply prints `n`.

4. **Determining the Output**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `neg` is the count of "-" characters in `s`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the expression `n - 2 * neg` will be evaluated and printed.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that all characters in `s` are "-", and the expression `n` will be printed.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

Given the initial state, we can summarize the output as follows:

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of "-" characters in s)**
