Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Negatives**: The program correctly counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that if the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is zero.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays that have a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible. The formula `n - 2 * neg` accounts for the difference in the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is the key to minimizing the penalty.

4. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is indeed a correct way to calculate the minimum penalty. This is because:
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the string consists entirely of '-' characters, and each subarray will have a penalty of 1. Therefore, the total penalty is `n`.
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly accounts for the number of '+' and '-' characters. For every '-' character, the sum of the array decreases by 1, and for every '+' character, the sum increases by 1. The formula `n - 2 * neg` effectively calculates the total length of the array minus twice the number of '-' characters, which is the minimum penalty when the array is split optimally.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `neg` (i.e., the string consists entirely of '-' characters). In this case, the penalty is `n` because each subarray will have a penalty of 1, and there will be `n` subarrays.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which is the correct output format.

However, there is a minor issue with the function definition in the original code. The function `func_1` should be defined to take the string `s` as an argument, as mentioned in the annotated code. This is a stylistic and best practice issue rather than a functional one, as the current implementation still works correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by calculating the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Final: **True**
