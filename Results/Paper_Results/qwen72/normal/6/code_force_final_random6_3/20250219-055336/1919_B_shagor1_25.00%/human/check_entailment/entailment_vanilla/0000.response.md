Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Negatives**: The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

4. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is zero.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays that have a sum of zero or as close to zero as possible. The formula `n - 2 * neg` accounts for the difference in the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is the key to minimizing the penalty.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `neg` (i.e., the string consists entirely of '-' characters). In this case, the penalty is `n` because each subarray will have a penalty of 1, and there will be `n` subarrays.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by calculating the minimum possible penalty for each test case.
