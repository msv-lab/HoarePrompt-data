The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `s` must be considered.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-".
- `i` is the second character of `s`.
- `neg` is 1 if `i` is "+", or `neg` is 2 if `i` is "-".

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `i` will be updated to the next character in the string `s`, which is the third character. The state of `neg` is not part of the loop head and therefore does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `i` is the third character of `s`, `n` is an input integer**
