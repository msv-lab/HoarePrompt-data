Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty correctly. It simply calculates the penalty based on the total number of negative and positive elements, which does not necessarily yield the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
++--++
```
The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is `([1,1],[-1,-1],[1,1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`. However, the program will output `2`, which is incorrect. 

The program fails to consider the optimal splitting strategy and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
