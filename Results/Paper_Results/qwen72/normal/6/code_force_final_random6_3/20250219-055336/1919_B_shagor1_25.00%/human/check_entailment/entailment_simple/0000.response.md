Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting a string `s` of length `n` into non-empty subarrays, where each character in `s` represents a value of 1 (for "+") or -1 (for "-"). The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect. It should be defined as `def func_1(s: str) -> int:` to match the problem description, where `s` is the input string.

2. **Logic for Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of "-" characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - It then prints the result of `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The correct approach should involve splitting the array in a way that minimizes the sum of penalties of the subarrays.

### Correct Approach:
- The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of zero. This is because the penalty for a subarray with a sum of zero is zero, and the penalty for any other subarray is positive.
- If the total sum of the array is zero, the penalty is zero.
- If the total sum of the array is not zero, the optimal split would be to split the array into subarrays of length 1, which results in a penalty of `n` (since each subarray of length 1 has a penalty of 1).

### Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    pos = n - neg
    if pos == neg:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(n)
    t -= 1
```

### Explanation:
- **`pos = n - neg`**: This calculates the number of "+" characters in the string.
- **`if pos == neg`**: If the number of "+" and "-" characters is equal, the total sum of the array is zero, and the minimum possible penalty is zero.
- **`else`**: If the number of "+" and "-" characters is not equal, the optimal split is to split the array into subarrays of length 1, resulting in a penalty of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The correct approach should consider the total sum of the array and split it optimally.

Correctness: **False**
