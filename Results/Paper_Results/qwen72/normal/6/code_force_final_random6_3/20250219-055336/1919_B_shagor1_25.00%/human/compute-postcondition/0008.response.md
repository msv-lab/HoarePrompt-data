The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. If `i` was "-", `neg` was initially 1, so it becomes 2. If `i` was "+", `neg` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `i` is the second character of `s`, `n` is an input integer, and `neg` is 1 if `i` is "+", or `neg` is 2 if `i` is "-".**
