Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is a list containing `[x]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

The value of `x` remains an integer within the specified range, and `x` is still divisible by `i` (which is 1). The list `output1` remains unchanged, containing `[1]`. The list `output2` now contains the value of `x` as its first element, and `i` remains 1.
