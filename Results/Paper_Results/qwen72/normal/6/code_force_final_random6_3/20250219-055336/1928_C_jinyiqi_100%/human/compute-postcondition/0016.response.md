Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`. The loop variable `i` remains `int(x`**. 

The `output1` list has been reversed, meaning the divisors of `x` that were originally in ascending order are now in descending order. The values of `x` and `output2` remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` is still `int(x`.
