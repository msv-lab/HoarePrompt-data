Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` == `r` and `k` >= a[r], we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.***
