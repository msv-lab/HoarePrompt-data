Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 2, n - 3, n - 3, or n - 4, `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
