Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that `l` is now 0 and `r` is now `n - 1`. This means `l` and `r` are set to the leftmost and rightmost indices of the list `a`, respectively.
