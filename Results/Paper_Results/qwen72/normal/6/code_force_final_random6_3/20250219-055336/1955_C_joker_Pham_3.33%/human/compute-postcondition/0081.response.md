Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 minus `a[r] * 2`, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3 depending on the initial values and updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 depending on the initial value and updates within the if block, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
