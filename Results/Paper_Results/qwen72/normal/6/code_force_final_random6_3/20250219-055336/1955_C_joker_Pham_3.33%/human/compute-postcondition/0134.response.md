The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

The function returns the total number of successful operations performed, `sunks`. Each operation either subtracts `2 * a[l]` from `k` and updates `a[r]` or subtracts `2 * a[r]` from `k` and updates `a[l]`, and increments `sunks` by 1 or 2 depending on the conditions.
