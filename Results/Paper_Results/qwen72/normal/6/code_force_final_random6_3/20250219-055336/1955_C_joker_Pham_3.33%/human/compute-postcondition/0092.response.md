Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3 depending on the initial values and updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 depending on the initial value and updates within the if block. If `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `r` is updated to `r - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
