Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 depending on the initial values and updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 depending on the initial value and updates within the if block, `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`. If `l` == `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
