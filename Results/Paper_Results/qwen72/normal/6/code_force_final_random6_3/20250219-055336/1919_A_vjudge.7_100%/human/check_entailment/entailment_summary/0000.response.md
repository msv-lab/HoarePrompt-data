Reasoning:  
The game described has a deterministic outcome based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key observation is that the game is essentially a parity game. Each player can either swap wallets or not, but the critical step is removing a coin, which changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of coins in the current player's wallet. 

Since both players play optimally, the game's outcome depends on the initial parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets:
- If the sum of the coins is even, then after each turn, the sum remains even. This means that the game will always end with both wallets being empty at the same time, and the player who is forced to make the last move (which would be impossible) will lose. Since Alice starts, if the sum is even, Bob will win.
- If the sum of the coins is odd, then after each turn, the sum alternates between odd and even. This means that the game will end with one wallet having one coin and the other wallet being empty. The player who is forced to make the last move will lose. Since Alice starts, if the sum is odd, Alice will win.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). Specifically, `a + b & 1` checks if the sum is odd (result is 1) or even (result is 0). If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

The provided execution summary confirms that the program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, then prints the correct winner based on the parity of the sum.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
