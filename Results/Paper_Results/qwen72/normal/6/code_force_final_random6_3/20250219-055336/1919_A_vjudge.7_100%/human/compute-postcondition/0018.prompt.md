Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. `test` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(test):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a + b & 1 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `test` must be greater than 0, and `t` is 0. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition is met. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `test` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd based on the user input. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `test` is greater than 1, and `t` is 2. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program executes the else part. The specific actions within the if and else parts are not detailed, but the sum of `a` and `b` retains its even or odd nature based on the user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
