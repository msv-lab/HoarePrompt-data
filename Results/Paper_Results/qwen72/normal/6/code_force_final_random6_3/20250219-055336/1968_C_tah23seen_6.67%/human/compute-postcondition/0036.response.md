The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= `i` < `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` where:
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`.
- The last element `ans[n-1]` is equal to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element (up to `n-2`) is the smallest value greater than the corresponding element in `arr` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding the previous element in `ans`, or the sum of the previous elements in `arr` and `ans` if already greater. The last element is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.**
