Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` constructs an array `a` such that for each `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` is satisfied. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `ans` is initialized with `n` zeros.
   - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to work correctly.

2. **Constructing the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2`), the value is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = arr[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i` remains `arr[i]` and `a_{i+1}` is large enough to satisfy the condition for the next element.

3. **Final Element**:
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the array `ans` and prints the elements of `ans`.

The program handles all the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description, and the logic ensures that the output array `a` satisfies the required conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
