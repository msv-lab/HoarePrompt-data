Output State: **The value of `ans[i + 1]` is now `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. The initial state specifies that `ans[i + 1]` was already equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, so after the execution, `ans[i + 1]` remains the same as it was in the initial state. The condition that `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]` is still valid.
