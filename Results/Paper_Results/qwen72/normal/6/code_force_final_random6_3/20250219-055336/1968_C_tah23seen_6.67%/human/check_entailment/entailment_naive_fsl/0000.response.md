Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values of `x_i` are such that the constructed `a_i` values do not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2
```
The program will output:
```
2 3 5
```
However, this output is incorrect because:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 3 % 2 = 1` (which is correct for `x_2`).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 5 % 3 = 2` (which is correct for `x_3`).

But if we consider a different input:
```
1
3
2 1
```
The program will output:
```
3 5 6
```
However, this output is incorrect because:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2` (which is correct for `x_2`).
- `a_3 % a_2 = 6 % 5 = 1` (which is correct for `x_3`).

The issue lies in the logic where the program constructs `a_i` values. Specifically, the line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` does not always ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i`. The program should ensure that `a_i` is always greater than `a_{i-1}` and that the modulo operation yields the correct `x_i` value. The current logic fails to handle edge cases where the constructed `a_i` values do not satisfy the modulo condition.
