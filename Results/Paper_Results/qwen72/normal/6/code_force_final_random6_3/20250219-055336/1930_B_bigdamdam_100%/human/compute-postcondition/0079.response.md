The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases, each providing a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation `p`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each providing an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation `p`. It returns a result based on the processing of these test cases, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
