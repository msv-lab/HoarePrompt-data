Output State: **`n` is an even number greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[1]` is 1, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, `p[4]` is `n - 4`, and so on, with the rest of the elements being zero, `ind` is 1.**

The value of `p[1]` is now 1, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
