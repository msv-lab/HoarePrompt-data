Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `p[1]` is `ind + 2`, `p[3]` is `ind`, `p[5]` is `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 2.**

Explanation:
- `ind` is increased by 2, so its new value is `ind + 2`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The expressions for `p[1]`, `p[3]`, and `p[5]` are still valid, but they now refer to the updated value of `ind`. Therefore, `p[1]` is now `ind + 4`, `p[3]` is `ind + 2`, and `p[5]` is `ind + 4`. However, since the specific values of `p[1]`, `p[3]`, and `p[5]` are not provided, we keep the expressions as they are, noting that `ind` has been updated.
