Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case provides a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all its iterations. `i` is `n-2` if `n` is even, or `n-3` if `n` is odd (the same as the initial state). `n` remains unchanged. `p` is a list where the elements at even indices (starting from 0) are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`, and the elements at odd indices (starting from 1) are `ind` values incremented by 2 for each iteration, up to the last odd index that is less than `n`. `ind` is the value it was at the start of the loop plus 2 times the number of iterations the loop completed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - (n % 2)`, `n` remains the same, `p[1]` is `1 + n % 2`, `p[3]` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[5]` is `5 + n % 2`, and so on, up to `p[n - (n % 2) - 1]` which is `n - 1`, and the rest of the elements in `p` are zeros, `ind` is `n - (n % 2) + 1 + n % 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an even number greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 1` (if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, otherwise `i` is undefined), `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[1]` is 1, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, `p[3]` is 3, `p[4]` is `n - 4`, `p[5]` is 5, and so on, with `p[j]` being `j + 1` for all odd indices `j` from 1 to `n - 1`, and the rest of the elements being zero, `ind` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
