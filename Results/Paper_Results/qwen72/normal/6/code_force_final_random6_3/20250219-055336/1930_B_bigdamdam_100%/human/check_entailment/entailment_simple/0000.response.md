### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then uses two loops to fill the list `p`:
     - The first loop fills the even indices of `p` with the largest odd numbers and the largest even numbers in descending order.
     - The second loop fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest odd numbers and the smallest even numbers in ascending order.

3. **Validation of Permutation:**
   - The permutation `p` is constructed such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
   - This is achieved by ensuring that the even and odd indices are filled with numbers that do not follow a simple divisibility pattern. For example, the largest numbers are placed at even indices, and the smallest numbers are placed at odd indices.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the permutation `p` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Permutation Construction:
- **Even Indices:**
  - The first loop fills even indices with the largest numbers in descending order. This ensures that the largest numbers are placed at even positions, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
- **Odd Indices:**
  - The second loop fills odd indices with the smallest numbers in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest numbers are placed at odd positions, which also helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.

### Example:
- For `n = 4`, the permutation `p` is constructed as follows:
  - `p[0] = 4` (largest even number)
  - `p[1] = 1` (smallest odd number)
  - `p[2] = 2` (second largest even number)
  - `p[3] = 3` (second smallest odd number)
  - The resulting permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.

- For `n = 3`, the permutation `p` is constructed as follows:
  - `p[0] = 3` (largest odd number)
  - `p[1] = 1` (smallest odd number)
  - `p[2] = 2` (largest even number)
  - The resulting permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. The permutation ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` exist such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
