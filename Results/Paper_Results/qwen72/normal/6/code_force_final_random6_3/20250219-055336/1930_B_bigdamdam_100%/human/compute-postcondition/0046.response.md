Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `p[1]` is `ind + 2`, `p[3]` is `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2.** 

In natural language, the value of `ind` is increased by 2, while the values of `i`, `n`, `p[1]`, and `p[3]` remain unchanged, but `p[1]` and `p[3]` now refer to the updated value of `ind`.
