Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `n - 2`, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[n - 2]` is `n - 4`, `ind` is equal to `n - 6`, and an `IndexError` occurs.**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. Initially, `ind` is `n - 4`, so after the operation, `ind` becomes `n - 6`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
