Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `p[1]` is `ind + 2`, `p[3]` is `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2, `p[5]` is `ind + 2`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 5.
- `n` remains greater than 5.
- `p[1]` remains `ind + 2`.
- `p[3]` remains `ind`.
- `ind` is increased by 2, so `ind` is now `ind + 2`.
- `p[5]` is assigned the new value of `ind`, which is `ind + 2`.
