Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list where the elements at even indices (starting from 0) are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-(i*2)`, and the element at index 1 is `ind` (1 if `n` is odd, or 2 if `n` is even), `ind` is 3 if `n` is odd, or 4 if `n` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. If `n` is odd, `ind` was initially 1, so after the increment, `ind` is 3. If `n` is even, `ind` was initially 2, so after the increment, `ind` is 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
