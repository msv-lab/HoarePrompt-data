The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each providing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each test case, it generates a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the elements at even indices are in descending order starting from `n` and decrementing by 2, and the elements at odd indices are in ascending order starting from 1 and incrementing by 2. The function prints the permutation `p` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the permutations and the input variables `n` and `p` are no longer relevant.
