Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is `n - 2`, the third and fourth elements are zeros, and the fifth element is `n - 4`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` (which is 4) with the value of `ind` (which is `n - 4`). The other elements in the list `p` remain unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` are also unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these specific values and the updated list `p`.
