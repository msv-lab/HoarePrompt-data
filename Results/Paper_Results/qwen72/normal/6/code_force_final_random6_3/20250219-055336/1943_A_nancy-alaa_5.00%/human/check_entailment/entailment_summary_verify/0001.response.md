### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just removes the picked element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are not included in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - Both players will focus on the smallest integers first, as they are the most critical for determining the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range of possible values (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The first condition checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `Counter` keys. If it is not, it means `i` is the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The second condition checks if `i` appears exactly once in the array and if it is Alice's turn (`first` is `True`). If both conditions are met, it means Alice can pick this element to maximize the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The third condition sets `first` to `True` when `i` appears exactly once, indicating that Alice will pick this element on her next turn.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the smallest integer that is not in the array.
   - However, the logic for handling the case where Alice and Bob are playing optimally is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first` does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times is included in `c` if it is her turn. This is because if an integer appears an odd number of times, Alice can always pick it to ensure it is included in `c`.
   - The optimal strategy for Bob is to ensure that the smallest integer that appears an even number of times is included in `c` if it is his turn. This is because if an integer appears an even number of times, Bob can always pick it to ensure it is not included in `c`.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where an integer appears an odd number of times and it is Alice's turn. It only checks if the integer appears exactly once, which is a special case of appearing an odd number of times.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where an integer appears an even number of times and it is Bob's turn. It does not have a condition to check for this scenario.

6. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 4` and `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - The program will set `first` to `True` when it encounters `0` (which appears twice), and then it will print `1` when it encounters `1` (which also appears twice).
   - However, the correct MEX should be `2` because both `0` and `1` appear an even number of times, and Bob can always pick them to ensure they are not included in `c`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It fails to handle the general case where an integer appears an odd number of times and it is Alice's turn, and it does not handle the case where an integer appears an even number of times and it is Bob's turn.

Final: **False**
