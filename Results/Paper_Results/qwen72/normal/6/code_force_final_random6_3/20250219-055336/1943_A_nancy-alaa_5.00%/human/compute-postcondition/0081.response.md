Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `first` is False, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `i` is not a key in the `mpp` Counter object, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
