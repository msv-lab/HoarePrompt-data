Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `first` is True
- `mpp` remains unchanged

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

The `print` statement will output the value of the variable `i`, which is explicitly given as 1 in the initial state.

Output: **1**
