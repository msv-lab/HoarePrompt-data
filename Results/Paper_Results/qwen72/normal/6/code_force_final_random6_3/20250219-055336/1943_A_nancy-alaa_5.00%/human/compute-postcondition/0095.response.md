Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `first` is False, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 but `first` is False, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
