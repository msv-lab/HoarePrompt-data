The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop iterator. The loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`, which specifies the number of iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `first` is True, and `mpp` remains unchanged. However, none of these variables (`i`, `n`, `first`, `mpp`) are part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

The loop will execute one more time if the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0 at the start of the loop. Since the loop iterator `_` is not used in the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `first` is True, and `mpp` remains unchanged.**
