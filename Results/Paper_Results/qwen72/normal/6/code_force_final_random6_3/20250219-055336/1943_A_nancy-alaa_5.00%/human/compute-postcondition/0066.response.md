Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `first` is True.
- `mpp` remains unchanged.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given the `print(i)` statement, the value of `i` is explicitly provided as 2. Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
