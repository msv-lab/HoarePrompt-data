Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if any integer from `0` to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False, and `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the outer loop.
- **`n`**: After all iterations, `n` will be the value of the last input integer provided for the size of the array.
- **`arr`**: This will be the last list of integers input by the user.
- **`mpp`**: This is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the last `arr`.
- **`first`**: This will be True if any integer from `0` to `n-1` appears exactly once in the last `arr` and is encountered before the loop breaks. Otherwise, it will be False.
- **`i`**: This will be the index of the first integer in the last `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True. If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be `n`.
