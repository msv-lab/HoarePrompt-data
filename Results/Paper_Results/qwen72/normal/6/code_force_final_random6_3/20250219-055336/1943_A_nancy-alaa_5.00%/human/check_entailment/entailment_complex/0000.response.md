### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from the array `a` and Alice appends her chosen element to a new array `c`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after all elements are picked from `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to delay the appearance of smaller integers.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to ensure that smaller integers appear in `c` as soon as possible.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates over the range `[0, n-1]` to find the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once and has been encountered before by Alice.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has picked an integer that appears exactly once.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it finds an integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once and `first` is `True`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX of `c` by ensuring that the smallest integer that is not in `c` is found.
   - The use of `Counter` helps in efficiently counting the frequency of each integer.
   - The logic of breaking the loop when the conditions are met ensures that the program finds the correct MEX.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `arr` by printing the last integer checked.
   - It also handles cases where some integers are missing or appear exactly once.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
