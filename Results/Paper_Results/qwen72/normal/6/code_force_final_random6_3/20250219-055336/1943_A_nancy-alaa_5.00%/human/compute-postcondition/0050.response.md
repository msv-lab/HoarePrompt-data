Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `i`, `n`, or `mpp`. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1 if `i` is a key in `mpp`.**
