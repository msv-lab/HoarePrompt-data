Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `i` is 2.
2. `n` must be greater than 2.
3. `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` remains False.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
5. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
6. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
7. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1 but `first` is False, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

Given the `print(i)` statement, we need to determine the value of `i` at the point of execution.

From the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The conditions involving `n`, `first`, and `mpp` do not affect the value of `i` directly. They only influence the flow of the program (e.g., breaking loops or if statements).

Since the `print(i)` statement is executed, and `i` is explicitly set to 2, the value of `i` will be 2 when the statement is executed.

Output: **2**
