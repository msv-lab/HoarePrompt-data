Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input describing a tree with `n` nodes and a starting node `u_1`. It then processes the tree structure to determine a final state, which is used to decide between two outcomes: 'Hermione' or 'Ron'. The function prints 'Ron' at the end, regardless of the input tree structure or starting node. **
