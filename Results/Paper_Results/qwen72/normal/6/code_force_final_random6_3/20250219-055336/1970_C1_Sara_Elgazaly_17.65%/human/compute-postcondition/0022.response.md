Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
