Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` as one of its elements (appears twice), `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` as one of its elements (appears three times).**

The code `lst[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `lst[b]`, which already contains `a` as one of its elements. Therefore, `a` now appears three times in `lst[b]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
