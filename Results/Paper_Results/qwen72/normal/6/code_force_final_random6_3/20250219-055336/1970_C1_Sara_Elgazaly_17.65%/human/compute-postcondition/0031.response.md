Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter and still contains at least one element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, and `y` has been removed from `lst[x]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
