To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is `n - 2`.
   - `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`.
   - If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`.
   - If `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `cn` is increased by `ck`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(n - max(cn, ck))`

Let's analyze the variables and their values:

- **`n`**: This is the total number of elements in the list `num`.
- **`ii`**: This is `n - 2`, which means it is the index of the second-to-last element in the list `num`.
- **`ck`**: This is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`. If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`.
- **`cn`**: This is initially not defined in the precondition, but it is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.

Given the initial state, let's consider the possible values of `ck` and `cn`:

- **`ck`**:
  - If the last `k` elements of `num` are equal, `ck` will be `k`.
  - If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` will be `n - 1`.

- **`cn`**:
  - If `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `cn` will be `ck`.
  - If `symb1` and `symb2` are not equal, `cn` will be 0 (since it is not defined otherwise).

Now, let's determine the value of `max(cn, ck)`:

- If `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `cn` will be `ck`.
- Therefore, `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck` in this case.
- If `symb1` and `symb2` are not equal, `cn` will be 0, and `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck`.

In both cases, `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck`.

Finally, the print statement `print(n - max(cn, ck))` will print:

- `n - ck`

Since `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, the output will be the number of elements from the start of `num` that are not part of the consecutive equal elements at the end.

Output: **n - ck (where ck is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`)**
