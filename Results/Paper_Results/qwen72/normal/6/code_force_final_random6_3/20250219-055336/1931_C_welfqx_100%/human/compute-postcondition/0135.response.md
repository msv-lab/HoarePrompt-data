Postcondition: ***`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0. If the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
