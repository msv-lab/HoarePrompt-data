Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found if the loop does not complete all iterations, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal. If all elements in `num` are equal, `cn` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial state variables `ii`, `ck`, `n`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n - 2` after the loop completes all iterations.
- The variable `j` will be the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found, or `n - 2` if all elements are equal.
- The variable `cn` will be the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal. If all elements in `num` are equal, `cn` will be `n - 1`.
