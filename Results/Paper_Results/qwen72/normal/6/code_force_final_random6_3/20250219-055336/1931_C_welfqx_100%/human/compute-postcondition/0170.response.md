Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 1. If all consecutive elements in `num` from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal, `cn` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` up to the point where the elements differ.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 2` (the last index the loop reaches). The variable `n` remains greater than 1, as it was in the initial state. The variable `cn` will be updated based on the number of consecutive equal elements in the list `num` starting from the first element. If all elements from the first to the second-to-last are equal, `cn` will be `n - 1`. If the elements differ at any point, `cn` will be the count of consecutive equal elements up to that point. The loop breaks as soon as it finds two consecutive elements that are not equal.
