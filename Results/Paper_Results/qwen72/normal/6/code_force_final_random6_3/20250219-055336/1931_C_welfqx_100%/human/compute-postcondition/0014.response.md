The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j + 1` (which is 3).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1 if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is 2.**
