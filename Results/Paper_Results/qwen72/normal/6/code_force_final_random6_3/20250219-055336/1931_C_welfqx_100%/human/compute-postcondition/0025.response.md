Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1.**

The variable `cn` is assigned the value 1, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
