The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `x` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0**
