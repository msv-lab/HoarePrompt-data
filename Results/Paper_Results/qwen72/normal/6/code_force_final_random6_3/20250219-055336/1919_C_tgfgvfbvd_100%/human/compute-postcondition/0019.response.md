The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `x`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` but greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`, `a` remains equal to `b`, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to infinity, and `c` is 1. In all cases, `a` and `b` are integers, and `c` is either 0 or 1.**
