Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is infinity, `c` is 1, `x` is 0. If `a` > `b`, `a` is equal to `b`. The element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a`, and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.**
