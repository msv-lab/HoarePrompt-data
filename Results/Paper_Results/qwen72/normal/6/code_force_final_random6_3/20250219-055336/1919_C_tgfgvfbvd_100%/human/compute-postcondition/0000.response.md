The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is valid and that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
