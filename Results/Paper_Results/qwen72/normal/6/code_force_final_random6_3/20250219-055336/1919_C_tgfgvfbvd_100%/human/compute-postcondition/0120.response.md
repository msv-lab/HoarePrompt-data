Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It then processes the list to find the smallest and second smallest integers, and counts how many integers in the list are greater than both of these values. Finally, it prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
