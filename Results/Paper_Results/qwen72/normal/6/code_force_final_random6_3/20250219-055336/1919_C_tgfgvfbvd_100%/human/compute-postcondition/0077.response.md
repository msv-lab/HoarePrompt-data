Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in `l` (if it exists), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `x` will be `n-1` after the loop has completed, as the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- The variable `a` will hold the smallest integer in the list `l`.
- The variable `b` will hold the second smallest integer in the list `l`, provided that such a second smallest integer exists. If all integers in `l` are the same, `b` will still be `float('inf')`.
- The variable `c` will count the number of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. If there are no such integers, `c` will be `0`.

The initial values of `_`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
