The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in the input `cases`. The exact nature of the results is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
