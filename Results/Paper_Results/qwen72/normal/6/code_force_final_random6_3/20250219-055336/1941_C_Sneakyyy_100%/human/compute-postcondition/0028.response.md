Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last checked substring.**

The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer greater than 0, while the values of `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
