Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` from the input. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the final state is that `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, and `ans` is the count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the last processed string. **
