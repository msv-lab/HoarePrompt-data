Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new input string with a length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' (in the else part), `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
