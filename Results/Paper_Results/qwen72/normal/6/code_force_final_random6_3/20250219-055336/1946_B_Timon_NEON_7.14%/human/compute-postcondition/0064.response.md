The only objects in the loop head are `segment` and `segments_variants`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `segments_variants`. At the end of the last iteration, `segment` was the second element in `segments_variants`, and `segments_variants` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to have executed up to this point.

For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must have at least 3 elements. The next element in `segments_variants` will be the third element, and `segment` will be updated to this third element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` must have at least 3 elements, `segment` is the third element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the third element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**
