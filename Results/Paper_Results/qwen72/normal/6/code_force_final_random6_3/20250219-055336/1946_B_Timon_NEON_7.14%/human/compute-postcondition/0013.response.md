Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `arr` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains [0, 0] and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[0, 0, -1]]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is an empty list and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `new_segment = []` reassigns `new_segment` to an empty list.
- The initial state specifies that `new_segment` was already an empty list, so this assignment does not change the value of `new_segment`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`) are not affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the explicit reassignment of `new_segment` to an empty list, which was already its initial value.
