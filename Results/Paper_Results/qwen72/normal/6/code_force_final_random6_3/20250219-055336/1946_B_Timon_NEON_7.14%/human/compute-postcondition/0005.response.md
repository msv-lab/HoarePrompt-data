Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the condition `(new_segment)` is false.** 

This postcondition reflects that the if condition `(new_segment)` is evaluated to false, as `new_segment` is an empty list according to the precondition. Therefore, the program state remains unchanged with respect to the variables and their values as described in the precondition.
