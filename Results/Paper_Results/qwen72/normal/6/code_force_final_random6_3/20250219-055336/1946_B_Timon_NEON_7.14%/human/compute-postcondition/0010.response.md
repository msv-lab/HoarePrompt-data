Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `[-1]`, `max_sum` is -1, the condition `(new_segment)` is false, the first element of `arr` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation:
- `segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new list to `segments_variants`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list and `i` is 0, `new_segment + [i - 1]` results in `[-1]`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `(new_segment)` is still false because `new_segment` is still an empty list.
- The initial conditions about `arr`, `max_segment`, and the first element of `arr` remain valid.
