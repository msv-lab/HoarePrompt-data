Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index, and now `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `new_segment` appended with `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is formed by concatenating `new_segment` with the value `len(arr) - 1`.
- `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index.
- If `new_segment` is an empty list, the appended list will be `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- If `new_segment` is a list, say `[sum, start_index]`, the appended list will be `[sum, start_index, len(arr) - 1]`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `max_segment` remain unchanged.
- The updated `segments_variants` now includes the additional list mentioned above.
