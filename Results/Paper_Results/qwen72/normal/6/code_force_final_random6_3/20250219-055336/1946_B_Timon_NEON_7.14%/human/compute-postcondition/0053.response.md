Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, and `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `arr` remains the same list of integers it was at the start.
- `i` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was processed by the loop.
- `max_sum` remains -1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `new_segment` is either an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and the starting index of that segment.
- `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found during the loop execution and the starting index of that segment.
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the sum of a segment of positive integers, the starting index of that segment, and the ending index of that segment. This list accumulates all segments of positive integers that were considered during the loop execution.
