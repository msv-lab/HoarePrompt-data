Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is set to [first element of `arr`, 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is set to [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is set to [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]`, 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to [arr[0] + arr[1]], `max_segment` is set to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]]. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `new_segment` is not set, `segments_variants` remains as [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` is not set, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1], and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is set, and `arr[2]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is either [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0] or [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and [[first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0, 1] or [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0, 1]]. If `new_segment` is set and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and `new_segment[0]` is `first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is not set and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0, and `new_segment` is [arr[2], 2]. If `new_segment` is not set and `arr[2]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0, and `new_segment` is not set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
