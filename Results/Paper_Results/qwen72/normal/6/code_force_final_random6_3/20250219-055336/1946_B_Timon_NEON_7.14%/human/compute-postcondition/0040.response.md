Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is either [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]`, 0] or [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], and [[first element of `arr` + `arr[1]`, 0, 1] or [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]].** 

The code snippet appends the list `max_segment` with the value `i - 1` (which is 1) to the `segments_variants` list. The initial state of `segments_variants` is either `[[first element of arr, 0, -1]]` or `[[arr[0], 0, 0]]`, depending on whether `arr[0]` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 0. After the code execution, `segments_variants` now contains the original list plus the new list `[max_segment + [1]]`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
