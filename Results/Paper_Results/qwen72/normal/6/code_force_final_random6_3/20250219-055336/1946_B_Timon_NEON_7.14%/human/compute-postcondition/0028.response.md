Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing [[`arr[0]`, 0, 0]].**

The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Since `new_segment` is a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `max_segment` now also holds that same list. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.
