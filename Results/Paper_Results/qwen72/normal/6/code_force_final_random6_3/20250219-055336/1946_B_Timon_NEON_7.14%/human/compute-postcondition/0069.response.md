Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index, and `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` updates the value of `total_max_segment` to a list containing a single element, `-1`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
