Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index, and now `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `new_segment` appended with `len(arr) - 1`, `total_max_segment` is [-1].
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index, and `segments_variants` must have at least one element. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` must have at least 2 elements, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the second element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` must have at least 3 elements, `segment` is the third element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the third element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
