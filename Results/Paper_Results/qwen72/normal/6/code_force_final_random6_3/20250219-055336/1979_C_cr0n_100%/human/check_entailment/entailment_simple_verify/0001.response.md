### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input, calculates the LCM of all `k_i`, and then determines the bets `x_i` as `den // k_i`, where `den` is the LCM.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`, and the program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0` to ensure the condition is met.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each multiplier in `vals`.
     - It then calculates the bets `vprod` as `den // k_i` for each `k_i`.
     - It checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. If true, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total amount bet is a multiple of the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the LCM approach fails to find a valid distribution, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the LCM approach fails to find a valid distribution by checking `den - sum(vprod) > 0`.
   - The program also handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case independently.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **State of the program right before the function call:**
     - `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50).
     - `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20).
   - **State after calculating `den`:**
     - `den` is the LCM of all elements in `vals`.
   - **State after calculating `vprod`:**
     - `vprod` is a list of `N` integers where each element is `den // k_i`.
   - **State after checking `den - sum(vprod) > 0`:**
     - If `den - sum(vprod) > 0`, the program prints the bets.
     - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, the program prints `-1`.

7. **Verification:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is a valid approach because it ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount bet is a multiple of the LCM.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` is a valid check to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. It also handles edge cases and multiple test cases appropriately.
