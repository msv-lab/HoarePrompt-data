To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
   - `den` is greater than 0.
   - `vprod` is a list of `N` integers where each element is calculated as `(den // r)` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of the list `vprod` as a space-separated string.

3. **Understanding `vprod`:**
   - Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `den // r` where `r` is an element from the list `vals`.
   - Since `den` is greater than 0 and each `r` is between 2 and 20, each element in `vprod` will be the integer division of `den` by the corresponding `r` in `vals`.

4. **Understanding the Update to `den`:**
   - After `vprod` is calculated, `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - However, this update to `den` does not affect the `vprod` list that is already computed and ready to be printed.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
   - Each element in `vprod` is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output will be a space-separated string of the integer divisions of `den` by each element in `vals`.

Output: **`vprod[0] vprod[1] ... vprod[N-1]` (where each `vprod[i]` is `den // vals[i]` for `0 â‰¤ i < N`)**
