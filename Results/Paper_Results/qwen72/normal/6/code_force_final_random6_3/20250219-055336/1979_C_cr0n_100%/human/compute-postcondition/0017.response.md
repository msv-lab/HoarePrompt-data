The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or depend on external variables or inputs, such as `N` and `vals`, which are not directly passed as arguments. `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `vals` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer `k_i` in the list satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20. The function returns without any specific value, meaning it does not return any data or result.

Functionality: **The function operates with an implied input of a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) and a list `vals` of `N` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). It performs some operations and returns without any specific value.**
