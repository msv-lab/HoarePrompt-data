### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input, calculates the LCM of all `k_i`, and then determines the bets `x_i` as `den // k_i`, where `den` is the LCM.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`, and the program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0` to ensure the condition is met.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each multiplier in `vals`.
     - It then calculates the bets `vprod` as `den // k_i` for each `k_i`.
     - It checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. If true, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total amount bet is a multiple of the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the LCM approach fails to find a valid distribution, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the LCM approach fails to find a valid distribution by checking `den - sum(vprod) > 0`.
   - The program also handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case independently.

6. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - **Test Case 1**: `N = 3`, `vals = [3, 2, 7]`
       - LCM of 3, 2, 7 is 42.
       - Bets: `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
       - Total bet: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
       - Check: `42 - 41 = 1 > 0` (valid)
       - Output: `14 21 6`
     - **Test Case 2**: `N = 2`, `vals = [3, 3]`
       - LCM of 3, 3 is 3.
       - Bets: `vprod = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`
       - Total bet: `1 + 1 = 2`
       - Check: `3 - 2 = 1 > 0` (valid)
       - Output: `1 1`
     - **Test Case 3**: `N = 5`, `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
       - LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 is 5.
       - Bets: `vprod = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
       - Total bet: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`
       - Check: `5 - 5 = 0` (not valid)
       - Output: `-1`
     - **Test Case 4**: `N = 6`, `vals = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
       - LCM of 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13 is 1989.
       - Bets: `vprod = [1989 // 7, 1989 // 9, 1989 // 3, 1989 // 17, 1989 // 9, 1989 // 13] = [284, 221, 663, 117, 221, 153]`
       - Total bet: `284 + 221 + 663 + 117 + 221 + 153 = 1659`
       - Check: `1989 - 1659 = 330 > 0` (valid)
       - Output: `284 221 663 117 221 153`
     - **Test Case 5**: `N = 3`, `vals = [6, 3, 2]`
       - LCM of 6, 3, 2 is 6.
       - Bets: `vprod = [6 // 6, 6 // 3, 6 // 2] = [1, 2, 3]`
       - Total bet: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
       - Check: `6 - 6 = 0` (not valid)
       - Output: `-1`
     - **Test Case 6**: `N = 5`, `vals = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
       - LCM of 9, 4, 6, 8, 3 is 72.
       - Bets: `vprod = [72 // 9, 72 // 4, 72 // 6, 72 // 8, 72 // 3] = [8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`
       - Total bet: `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 71`
       - Check: `72 - 71 = 1 > 0` (valid)
       - Output: `8 18 12 9 24`

   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - It handles edge cases and multiple test cases appropriately.
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
