Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It is used to find a common multiple of all the multipliers `k_i` in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: `N` (number of outcomes) and `vals` (list of multipliers for each outcome).
   - **Steps**:
     - Initialize `den` with the first element of `vals`.
     - Compute the LCM of all elements in `vals` and store it in `den`.
     - Compute a list `vprod` where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
     - Calculate the difference `den - sum(vprod)`.
     - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, print `-1` and return, indicating no valid distribution.
     - Otherwise, print the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of all `k_i` values ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - **Distribution Calculation**: Each `vprod[i]` is `den // vals[i]`, which means the amount received back for the i-th outcome is `vals[i] * (den // vals[i]) = den`.
   - **Total Bet**: The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
   - **Condition Check**: The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than `den`, which is the amount received back for any winning outcome.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` values are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the total bet will be `N * (den // k_i)`. For the condition to hold, `N * (den // k_i) < den`, which simplifies to `N < k_i`. If `N >= k_i`, the function will correctly print `-1`.
   - For different `k_i` values, the LCM will be a larger number, and the total bet will be the sum of `den // k_i` for all `k_i`. The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` will hold if the multipliers are sufficiently large.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM and distributes the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program handles edge cases where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
