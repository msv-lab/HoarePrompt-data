Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals` for each outcome.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iterates through all multipliers to compute the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // k_i` and stores these bets in `vprod`.
   - It then checks if the total amount of coins bet (`sum(vprod)`) is greater than or equal to `den`. If it is, it prints `-1` because it's not possible to come out ahead.
   - If the total amount of coins bet is less than `den`, it prints the bets.

The logic ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirements. The program also handles the constraints and edge cases correctly, such as when there is no valid distribution of coins.

Therefore, the program is correct.
