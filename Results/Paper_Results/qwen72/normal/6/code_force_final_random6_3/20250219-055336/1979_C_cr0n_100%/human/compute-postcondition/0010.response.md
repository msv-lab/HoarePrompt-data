Output State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial `den` and all elements in `vals` sequentially, `vprod` is a list of N integers where each element is `(den // r)` for each `r` in `vals`.**
