The function `func_2` takes an implied input of a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) and a list `vals` of `N` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). It calculates a value `den` by applying a function `func_1` to the elements of `vals` sequentially. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the final value of `den` after subtracting the sum of `vprod` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns without any specific value. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string and returns without any specific value.
