Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the array has different elements but can be made equal by selecting a subarray that includes the first and last elements. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 2 2 1
```

The correct output should be `3` because you can select `i = 1`, `j = 4`, and `x = 1` to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a cost of `3` burles. However, the given program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The program incorrectly assumes that if the first and last elements are not equal, the cost should be `r - l` without considering the possibility of making the entire array equal by including the first and last elements in the subarray.
