Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `n - 3`, `r` is `n - 5`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is 2.** 

The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 5`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
