Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 2, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 2, `end` is 0, `ans` is the difference `r - l`**

Explanation:
- `l` is incremented by 1, so its value changes from 2 to 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
