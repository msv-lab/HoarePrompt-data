Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r + 1]` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, `ans` is the difference `r - l`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer, and it must be at least 5.
- The list `a` remains the same list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `l` is still the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r`, and `l` is at least 3.
- The variable `r` is now the largest index where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r + 1]`, and `r` must still be greater than `l`.
- The variable `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` is equal to `a[l]`.
- The variable `st` remains `l`.
- The variable `end` is the number of times the loop executed.
- The variable `ans` is the difference between the final value of `r` and `l`.
