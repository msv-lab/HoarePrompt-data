Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 7`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 3, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 6]`, `_` is 2, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of elements in `v` that can form pairs and triplets.**

The value of `v[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
