Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is now ready to read input from `sys.stdin`. The initial state variables `t` and the list of lists containing exponents of the lengths of the sticks remain unchanged. `data` is a list of strings, each string being an element from the input split by spaces. `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 elements from the elements in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` remains the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` remains `n + n + 3`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `x` remains the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` remains `n - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of elements in `v` that can form pairs and triplets.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3 + n`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing three string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2 + n - 1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
