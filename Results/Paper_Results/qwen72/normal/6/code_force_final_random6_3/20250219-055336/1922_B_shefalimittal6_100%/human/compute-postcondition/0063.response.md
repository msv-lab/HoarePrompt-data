Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` is `n - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is `t - 1`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`idx` is `n + n + 3`**: The loop increments `idx` by 1 for each iteration. After `n` iterations, `idx` will be `n + 3 + n`.
- **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer**: This remains unchanged.
- **`results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`**: This remains unchanged.
- **`v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1**: The loop reads `n` values from `data` starting at index `n + 3` and increments the corresponding index in `v` by 1 for each value.
- **`n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0**: This remains unchanged.
- **`cnt` is 0**: This variable is not modified by the loop.
- **`i` is `n`**: This variable is not modified by the loop.
- **`x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`**: After the last iteration, `x` will be the last value read from `data`, which is at index `n + n + 2`.
- **`_` is `n - 1`**: The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and after `n` iterations, it will be `n - 1`.
