Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged, so `t` is still greater than 0, `data` is still a list of strings, `results` is still an empty list, and `n` is still the integer value of `data[1]`.
