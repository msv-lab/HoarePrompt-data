The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is `v[1]`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 0 if `v[1]` is less than 3. If `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`.**
