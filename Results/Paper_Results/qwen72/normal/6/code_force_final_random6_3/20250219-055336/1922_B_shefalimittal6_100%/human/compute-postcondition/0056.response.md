Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `_` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `idx` is `n + 4`, so `x` is now the integer value of `data[n + 4]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
