Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[4])`.**

The value of `v[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
