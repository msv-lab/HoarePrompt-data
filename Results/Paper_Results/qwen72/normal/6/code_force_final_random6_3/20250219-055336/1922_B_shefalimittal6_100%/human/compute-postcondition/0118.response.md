Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3 + n`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now `n`, `cnt` is the value of `v[i]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2 + n - 1]`, `_` is `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
