Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]`, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` remains `n + n + 3`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `x` remains the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` is 0, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of elements in `v` that can form pairs and triplets.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `idx` was `n + n + 3`, so `n` is now the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
