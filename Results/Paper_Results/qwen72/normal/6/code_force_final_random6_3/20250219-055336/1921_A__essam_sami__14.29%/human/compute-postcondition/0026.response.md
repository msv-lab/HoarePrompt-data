Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are new integers provided by the user, `c` and `d` are integers provided by the user, `e` and `f` are new integers provided by the user, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `g` and `h` are new integers provided by the user, `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
