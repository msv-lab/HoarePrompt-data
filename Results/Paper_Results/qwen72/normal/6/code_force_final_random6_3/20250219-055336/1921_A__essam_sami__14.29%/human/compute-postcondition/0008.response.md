Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `c` and `d` are integers provided by the user, `e` and `f` are integers provided by the user, `g` and `h` are integers provided by the user, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h), and the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`.**
