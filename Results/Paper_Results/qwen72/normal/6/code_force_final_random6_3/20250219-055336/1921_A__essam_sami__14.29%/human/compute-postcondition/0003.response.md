The code snippet `c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `c` and `d`. The initial state variables `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `c` and `d` are integers provided by the user.**
