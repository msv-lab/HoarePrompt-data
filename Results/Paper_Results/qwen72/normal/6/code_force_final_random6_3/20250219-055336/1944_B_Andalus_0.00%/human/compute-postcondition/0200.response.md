Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 0, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k`. If `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`, then `elem` is the last element in `sng`.**
