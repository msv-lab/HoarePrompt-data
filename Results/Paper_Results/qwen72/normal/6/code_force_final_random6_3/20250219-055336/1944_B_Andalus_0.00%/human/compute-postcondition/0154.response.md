Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[2]`, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` also contains the value of `rgt[1]` (which is equal to `rgt[0]`).**
