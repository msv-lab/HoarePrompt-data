Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `sng` must have at least two elements.
- `elem` is the second element of `sng`.
- `sz` is incremented by 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the program continues with `sz` being `sz + 1` and still less than `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`sng`**: This is a list with at least two elements. The exact values of the elements are not specified, but we know it has at least two elements.
2. **`elem`**: This is the second element of the list `sng`. Since the exact values of the elements in `sng` are not provided, we can only describe `elem` as the second element of `sng`.
3. **`sz`**: This variable is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `sz` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact value of `sz` after the increment.
4. **`k`**: This is a threshold value. The initial value of `k` is not provided, but we know that if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Execution:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).
- The value of `elem` is the second element of the list `sng`.

### Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element of the list sng)**
