Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 6 if `k - sz >= 2` was true, otherwise `sz` is 4, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
