Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`i` remains `n - 1`**: This indicates that `i` is set to `n - 1`, but it doesn't affect the print statement directly.
2. **`n` remains greater than or equal to 1**: This ensures that `n` is at least 1, but again, it doesn't directly impact the print statement.
3. **`rdb` remains unchanged**: The list `rdb` is not modified, but it's not directly used in the print statement.
4. **`sz` remains `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`**: This defines the size `sz` based on `k` and the length of `rdb`.
5. **The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each**: This indicates that some elements of `rdb` have been printed, but it doesn't affect the print statement.
6. **`sng` must have at least 2 elements**: This ensures that `sng` has at least two elements.
7. **`elem` is the second element in `sng`**: This specifies that `elem` is the second element of the list `sng`.
8. **If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**: This condition ensures that the loop has exited if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
9. **If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times**: This condition indicates that if there is enough room (`k - sz >= 2`), additional elements have been printed.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

- **`elem`**: This is the second element in the list `sng`.
- **`end=' '`**: This means that the output will be followed by a space, not a newline.

Since `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` will be the second element of `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng)**
