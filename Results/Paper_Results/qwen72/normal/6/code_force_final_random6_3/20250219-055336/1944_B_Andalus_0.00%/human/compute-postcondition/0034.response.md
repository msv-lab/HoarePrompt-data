The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`, `rdb` is either empty or contains the value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.**
