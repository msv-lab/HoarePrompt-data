The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 by default. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
