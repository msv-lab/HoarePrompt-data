Output State: **`sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist). `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements. `i` is `n - 1`. The values of `sz`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (i.e., `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1`).
- For each iteration, if the current element `lft[i]` is equal to the previous element `lft[i-1]`, it is appended to `ldb`.
- If the current element `lft[i]` is not equal to the previous element `lft[i-1]` and is also not equal to the next element `lft[i+1]` (if `i < n-1`), it is appended to `sng`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variables `sz`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `rdb` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
