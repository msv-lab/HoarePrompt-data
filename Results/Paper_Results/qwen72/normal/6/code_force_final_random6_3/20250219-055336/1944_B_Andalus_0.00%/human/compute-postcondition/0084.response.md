Output State: **`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted, `sz` is now 0, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains the same, with the addition that the program has broken out of the loop or if statement.
