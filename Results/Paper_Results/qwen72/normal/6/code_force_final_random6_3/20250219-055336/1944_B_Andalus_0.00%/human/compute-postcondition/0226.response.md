Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This means `i` is the last index of the list `lft` if `n` is the length of `lft`.
2. **`n` must be greater than 1**: This ensures that `lft` has at least two elements.
3. **`sng` is a non-empty list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist)**: This means `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their immediate context.
4. **`ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements**: This means `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that are duplicates of their immediate preceding elements.
5. **`sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller)**: This means `sz` is the smallest even number that is at least `k`, or if `rdb` has fewer elements, `sz` is the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2.
6. **`T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged**: These variables are not modified and retain their initial values.
7. **`elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `rdb` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`)**: This means `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed during some loop or condition check.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- **`elem`**: According to the initial state, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k`. If `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`, `elem` is simply the last element in `rdb`.

### Output:
- The print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the last element in rdb that was processed before sz reached or exceeded k, or the last element in rdb if sz never reaches or exceeds k)**
