Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is 2, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, followed by the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2, and the loop has printed the next 2 elements. If `k - sz` is less than 2, then `sz` remains 2, and no additional elements are printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited. If `sz` is less than `k`, the loop continues to execute.***
