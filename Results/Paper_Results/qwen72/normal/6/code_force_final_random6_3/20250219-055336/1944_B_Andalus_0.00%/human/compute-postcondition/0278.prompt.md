Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements (i.e., `lft[i]` where `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are duplicates of their previous elements (i.e., `lft[i]` where `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`), `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements in `sng`, `T` is unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`), `_` is `n`, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` has `rgt[1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, `rdb` has `rgt[3]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
