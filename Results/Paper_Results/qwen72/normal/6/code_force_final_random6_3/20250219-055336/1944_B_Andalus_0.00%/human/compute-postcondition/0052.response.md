Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `ldb` must have at least two elements, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
