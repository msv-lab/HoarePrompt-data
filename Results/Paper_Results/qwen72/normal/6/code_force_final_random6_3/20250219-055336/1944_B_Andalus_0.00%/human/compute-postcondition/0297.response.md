Based on the initial state:

- `ldb` is a list that must have at least three elements.
- `elem` is the third element of `ldb`.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify `elem`**:
   - According to the precondition, `elem` is the third element of `ldb`. Since `ldb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is well-defined and can be accessed.
   - If `ldb` is, for example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `elem` would be `3`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Since `elem` is the third element of `ldb`, and the `print` statement will print `elem` twice followed by a space, the output will be:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element of the list `ldb`)**
