Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is 2 or 4 depending on the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
