Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `sng` is a list that must contain at least three elements.
- `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
- `sz` is increased by 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`sng`**: This list must contain at least three elements. The exact values of these elements are not specified, but we know that the third element is `elem`.
2. **`elem`**: This variable holds the value of the third element in the list `sng`.
3. **`sz`**: This variable is increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. However, this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
4. **`k`**: This variable is mentioned in the context of a condition, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.

### What is Printed:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `elem`, which is the third element in the list `sng`.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
