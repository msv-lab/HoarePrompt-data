The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb` list. If `ldb` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts should ensure that `ldb` is not empty, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 0, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[i]` for all `i` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`**
