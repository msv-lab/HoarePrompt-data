The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `lst`.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers.**
