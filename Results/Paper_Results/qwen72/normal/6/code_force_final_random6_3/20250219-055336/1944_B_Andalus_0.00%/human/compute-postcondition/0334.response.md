The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is 2 or 4 depending on the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least one more element. The `elem` will be the next element in `rdb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is 2 or 4 depending on the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`**
