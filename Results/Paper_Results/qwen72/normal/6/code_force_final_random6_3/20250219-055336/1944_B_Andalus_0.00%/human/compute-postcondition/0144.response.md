The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` adds the element `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, and `i` is 3. The value of `lft[i]` will be added to `ldb`, which previously contained the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` was equal to `lft[i - 1]`, or was an empty list otherwise. After this operation, `ldb` will contain the element `lft[3]`.

Output State: **`sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the element `lft[3]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 3.**
