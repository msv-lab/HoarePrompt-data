Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine the output:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sng` must have at least three elements.
   - `elem` is the third element of `sng`.
   - `sz` is `sz + 2`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `sz` is still less than `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem`.
   - `elem` is explicitly defined as the third element of the list `sng`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `sng` must have at least three elements, the third element is well-defined.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is the third element of `sng`.

Therefore, the output will be the third element of the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element of the list sng)**
