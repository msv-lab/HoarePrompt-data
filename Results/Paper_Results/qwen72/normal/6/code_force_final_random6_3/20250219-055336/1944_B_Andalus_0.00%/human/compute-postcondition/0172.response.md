To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2` and otherwise `sz` remains 0.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
   - `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[i]` for all `i` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `ldb`.
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 2 elements.

Since `ldb` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` will be the second element of `ldb`. The exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, but we know it is a specific element from `lft` that meets the criteria of being equal to its immediate preceding element.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe it as the second element in `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element in the list `ldb`)**
