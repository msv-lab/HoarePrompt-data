The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and `sz` is now `sz + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element remaining after the first element has been processed. This means `sng` must have at least two elements at the start of the next iteration. The `elem` will be the second element in `sng`.

State: **`sng` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`**
