Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is 0, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, followed by the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 2, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, followed by the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2, and the loop has printed the next 2 elements. If `k - sz` is less than 2, then `sz` remains 2, and no additional elements are printed. In both cases, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased to 4, and the loop has printed the next 2 elements. If `k - sz` is less than 2, then `sz` remains 2, and no additional elements are printed. In both cases, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, followed by the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited. If `sz` is less than `k`, the loop continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to 4 or 6 depending on the new condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` remains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
