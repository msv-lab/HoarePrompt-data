Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 0, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k`. If `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`, then `elem` is the last element in `sng`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 0. `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` was true, otherwise `sz` remains 2. `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 6 if `k - sz >= 2` was true, otherwise `sz` is 4, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
