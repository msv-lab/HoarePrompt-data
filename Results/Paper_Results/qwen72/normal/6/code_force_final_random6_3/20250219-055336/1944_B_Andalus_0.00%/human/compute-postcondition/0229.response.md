Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a non-empty list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus 1, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
