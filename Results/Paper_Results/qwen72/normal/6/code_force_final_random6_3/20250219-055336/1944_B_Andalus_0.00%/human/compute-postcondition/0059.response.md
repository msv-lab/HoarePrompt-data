Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`T` is greater than 0**: This is a condition that is true, but it doesn't directly affect the print statement.
2. **`_` is 0**: This variable is not used in the print statement.
3. **`n` is greater than 1**: This means `n` is at least 2.
4. **`k` is an input integer**: The value of `k` is not explicitly given, but it is an integer.
5. **`lst` is a list of input integers**: The exact values of `lst` are not provided, but it is a list of integers.
6. **`lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order**: `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. **`rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order**: `rgt` is a sorted list of the elements of `lst` starting from index `n`.
8. **`i` is `n - 1`**: `i` is the index just before the start of `rgt` in `lst`.
9. **`ldb` must have at least three elements**: `ldb` is a list that must have at least three elements.
10. **`sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`**: `sng` is a list of elements in `lft` that are unique in their position.
11. **`rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element**: `rdb` is a list of elements in `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
12. **`sz` is 4 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 2**: `sz` is determined based on the value of `k`.
13. **`elem` is the third element in `ldb`**: `elem` is the third element of the list `ldb`.
14. **The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0**: This condition is true, but it doesn't directly affect the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
- `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and `ldb` must have at least three elements.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and it is printed twice, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the third element in the list ldb)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the structure of the `print` statement.
