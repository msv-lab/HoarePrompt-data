Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, followed by the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The variable `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `rdb` still contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements.
- The variable `sz` is now the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
- The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
- After printing the elements from `ldb`, the loop has printed the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements from `sng`.
- The loop will stop either when `sz` reaches `k` or when there are no more elements to print from `sng`.
