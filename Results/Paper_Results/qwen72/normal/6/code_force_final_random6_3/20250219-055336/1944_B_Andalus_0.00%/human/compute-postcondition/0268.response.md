To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n-1`, and this sequence must contain at least one element for the loop to run.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer

We need to adjust `i` to start at 1, and ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
