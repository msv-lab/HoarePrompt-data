Postcondition: **`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted, `sz` is now 0, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, which means `k` is at least 2 since `sz` is currently 0.**
