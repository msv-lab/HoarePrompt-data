The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `elem` will be the first element in `sng` when the loop starts.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist) and must have at least 1 element, `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the first element in `sng`.**
