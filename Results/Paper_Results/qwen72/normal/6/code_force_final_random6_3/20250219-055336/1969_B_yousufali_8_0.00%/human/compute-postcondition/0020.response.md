Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that is preceded by at least one 1.**

Natural language description:
- The loop iterates through each element in the list `s` from index 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- For each element, if it is 1, the variable `n` is incremented by 1.
- If the element is 0 and `n` is not 0, the variable `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be at the last index of the list, `n` will be the total count of 1s in the list, and `ans` will be the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in the list that is preceded by at least one 1.
