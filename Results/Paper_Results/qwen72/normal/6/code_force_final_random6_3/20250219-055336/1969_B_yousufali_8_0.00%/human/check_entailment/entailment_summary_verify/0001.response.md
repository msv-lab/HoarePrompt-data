### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the input handling in `func_1`. The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is indeed incorrect for reading a binary string. The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - After reading the string, it should be converted to a list of integers for further processing, which can be done using `s = list(map(int, s))`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `n` to 0, which is used to count the number of 1s encountered.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
   - If the character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of 1s and 1 is the 0) is `n + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost is correct. The idea is to count the number of 1s and then, whenever a 0 is encountered, add the cost of shifting the substring containing the 1s and the 0.
   - However, the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect, which will cause the program to fail on actual test cases.

5. **Additional Consideration:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not handle the case where the string ends with a sequence of 1s. In such a case, the cost of shifting the entire sequence of 1s to the end of the string should be considered. This can be done by adding `n` to `ans` after the loop if `n` is not 0.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    s = list(map(int, s))  # Convert the string to a list of integers
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
            n = 0  # Reset n after a 0 is encountered
    if n != 0:
        ans += n  # Add the cost of the final sequence of 1s
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was accurate in identifying the incorrect input handling in `func_1`.
- The logic for calculating the cost is correct but incomplete. The program needs to handle the case where the string ends with a sequence of 1s.
- After correcting the input handling and adding the necessary logic to handle the final sequence of 1s, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
