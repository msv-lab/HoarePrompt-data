### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input, where `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s).
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of 1s encountered.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the cost of operations.
   - The function iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
     - If the character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm in `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.
   - The key idea is to count the number of 1s (`n`) and add `n + 1` to the cost (`ans`) for each 0 that is preceded by at least one 1.
   - This is because each 0 that is preceded by 1s requires a cyclic shift of the substring containing the 1s and the 0 to move the 0 to the correct position, and the cost of such a shift is `n + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly prints 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If the string contains only 0s or only 1s, the function correctly prints 0 because no operations are needed.
   - For strings like "101011", the function correctly calculates the cost as 5, which is the sum of the costs for each 0 that is preceded by 1s.

5. **Input and Output Constraints:**
   - The input constraints are respected: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the length of each binary string `s` is between 2 and 200,000.
   - The sum of the lengths of all strings over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

6. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - Each call to `func_1` processes a single binary string and prints the minimum cost to sort it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each.

**Correctness: **True****
