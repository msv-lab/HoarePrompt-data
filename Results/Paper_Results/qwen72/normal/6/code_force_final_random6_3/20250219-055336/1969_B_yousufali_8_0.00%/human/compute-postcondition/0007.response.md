Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input integer `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations that the loop performed. The loop variable `_` will have the value `t-1`, which is the last index of the range. Additionally, the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times, one for each iteration of the loop.
