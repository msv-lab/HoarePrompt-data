Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `func_1()` has been called.** 

The code snippet calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine any changes it might make to the variables or the program state. Therefore, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that `func_1()` has been executed.
