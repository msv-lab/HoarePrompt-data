The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called.**
