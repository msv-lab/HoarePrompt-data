Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input, where `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with a length between 2 and 200,000. It processes this list and prints the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that is preceded by at least one 1, where `n` is the count of 1s encountered before the 0. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input list `s` remains unchanged, and the final state of the program includes the printed result. **
