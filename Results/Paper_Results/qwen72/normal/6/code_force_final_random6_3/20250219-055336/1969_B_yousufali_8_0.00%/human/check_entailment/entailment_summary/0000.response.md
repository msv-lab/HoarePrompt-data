Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input**: The function reads a binary string `s` from the input, where `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s).
- **Processing**:
  - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of 1s encountered.
  - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
  - It iterates through the string `s`:
    - If the current character is 1, it increments `n`.
    - If the current character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
- **Output**: It prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input**: The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
- **Processing**:
  - It iterates `t` times.
  - In each iteration, it calls `func_1` to process a binary string and print the result.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value, but the side effects of `func_1` are the printed results for each test case.

### Issues with `func_1`:
- **Input Parsing**: The function `func_1` is incorrect because it uses `list(map(int, input().split()))` to read the binary string. This will split the string by spaces, which is not the correct way to read a binary string. Instead, it should read the string as a whole and convert it to a list of integers.
- **Logic**: The logic of `func_1` is flawed. It adds `n + 1` to `ans` for each 0 that is preceded by at least one 1. This does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string. The correct approach should consider the transitions between 1s and 0s and the cost of cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

### Correct Approach:
- For a binary string to be sorted in non-descending order, all 1s should come before all 0s.
- The minimum cost to achieve this can be determined by finding the number of transitions from 1 to 0 and the length of the substrings involved in these transitions.
- The correct logic should be:
  - Count the number of 1s in the string.
  - Count the number of 0s in the string.
  - Identify the positions where a 1 is followed by a 0.
  - The minimum cost is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to move all 1s to the front.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly solve the problem as described. The input parsing in `func_1` is incorrect, and the logic for computing the minimum cost is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
