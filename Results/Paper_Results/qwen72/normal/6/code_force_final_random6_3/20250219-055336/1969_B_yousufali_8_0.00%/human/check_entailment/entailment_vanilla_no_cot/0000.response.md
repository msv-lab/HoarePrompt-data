Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Input Parsing**: In `func_1()`, the input is being split and converted to a list of integers, which is incorrect for a binary string. The input should be taken as a string directly.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the cost is `n + 1` whenever a `0` is encountered after a `1`, but this does not correctly account for the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the binary string for each test case and process it accordingly.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result inside `func_1()`, which is not the correct approach for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after all test cases are processed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    ones = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        else:
            if ones > 0:
                cost += ones + 1
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        results.append(min_cost_to_sort(s))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The binary string `s` is read as a string directly.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The function `min_cost_to_sort` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by counting the number of `1`s and adding the cost whenever a `0` is encountered after a `1`.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `min_cost_to_sort` and collecting the results.
4. **Output**: The results are printed after all test cases are processed.

This corrected version should work as expected for the given problem.
