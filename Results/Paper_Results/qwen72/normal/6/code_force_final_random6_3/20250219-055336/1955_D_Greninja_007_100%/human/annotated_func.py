#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.

    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of contiguous sublists of length `m` in the list `a` that have at least `k` elements in common with the list `b`. The function maintains the state of the input parameters and the Counter objects `ca` and `cb` throughout its execution. After the function concludes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` are not modified, and the return value `ans` represents the count of such sublists.
