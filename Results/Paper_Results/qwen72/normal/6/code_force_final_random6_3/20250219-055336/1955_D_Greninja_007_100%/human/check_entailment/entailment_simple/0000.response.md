### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by creating a `Counter` object `cb` for the sorted list `b` and a `Counter` object `ca` for the sorted first subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - It calculates the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` using `(ca & cb).values()`.
   - If this sum `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The function then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` from index `m` to `n-1` using a sliding window approach.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It checks if the count of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` by 1.
     - It increments the count of `a[r]` in `ca`.
   - For the element `a[r-m]` that is removed from the window:
     - It checks if the count of `a[r-m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` by 1.
     - It decrements the count of `a[r-m]` in `ca`.
   - After updating the window, it checks if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if true.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total count of good subsegments `ans`.

### Analysis of the Sliding Window Logic:
- The sliding window approach is efficient and correctly updates the counts of elements in the current window.
- The conditions for updating `sm` are correctly implemented:
  - When adding a new element to the window, if its count in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, it means the element is contributing to the sum of common elements, so `sm` is incremented.
  - When removing an element from the window, if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`, it means the element was contributing to the sum of common elements, so `sm` is decremented.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `m`.
- The constraints are respected, and the program should handle the maximum input sizes efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the given problem description and constraints.
