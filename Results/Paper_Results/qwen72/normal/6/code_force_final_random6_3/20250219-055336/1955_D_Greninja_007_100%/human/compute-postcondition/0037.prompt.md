Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
        sm += 1
    ca[a[r]] += 1
    if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
        sm -= 1
    ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` plus 1 if `ca[a[r]]` was less than `cb[a[r]]` before the increment and `ca[a[r - m]]` was greater than `cb[a[r - m]]` before the decrement, otherwise `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` minus 1 if `ca[a[r - m]]` was equal to `cb[a[r - m]]` before the decrement, otherwise `sm` remains the same. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2 and `r` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `r` is `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq m < n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), `b` is a list of \(m\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^6\), `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m+1]` with `ca[a[m]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[0]]` decremented by 1, and `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1. The count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` and `r` remain the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq m < n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), `b` is a list of \(m\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^6\), `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m+1]` with `ca[a[m]]` incremented by 1, `ca[a[0]]` decremented by 1, and `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1. The count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is decreased by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is decreased by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. `r` is `m + 1`. If `sm` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` and `r` remain the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
