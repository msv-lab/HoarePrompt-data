The value of `sm` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m]` and `b` plus 1, `ans` is 1 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, and the count of the element `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the count of the same element in `cb`.**
