The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `n`, and `k`. `tree` is an instance of the Tree class representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed. The function returns the value of `beg`, which is equal to `end` and `mid`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tree with `n` vertices, the number of vertices `n`, and a number of edges to be removed `k`. It returns a value `beg` which is equal to `end` and `mid`.**
