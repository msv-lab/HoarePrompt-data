The function `func_1` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `s` representing a starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), and a non-negative integer `x`. It modifies the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex in the tree. After the function concludes, for each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of the `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Similarly, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the starting vertex `s`.
