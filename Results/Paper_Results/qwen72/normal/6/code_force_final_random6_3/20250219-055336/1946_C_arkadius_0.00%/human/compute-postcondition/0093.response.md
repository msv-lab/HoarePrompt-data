Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before and must still contain at least one element, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` have been fully iterated over, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `tree` object remains a Tree with `n` vertices.
- The starting vertex `s` and the non-negative integer `x` remain unchanged.
- The value `v` is still the value of the first element popped from `stack`, and the `stack` has one fewer element but still contains at least one element.
- The `postorder` variable remains `True`.
- The loop has fully iterated over all the children of the vertex `v`.
- The `good_components` attribute of vertex `v` is now the sum of the `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- The `remaining_size` attribute of vertex `v` is updated to the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
