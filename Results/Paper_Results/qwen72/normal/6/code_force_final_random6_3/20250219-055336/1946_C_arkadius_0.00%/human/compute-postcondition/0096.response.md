Output State: **The program returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the tree. `good_components` is the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**
