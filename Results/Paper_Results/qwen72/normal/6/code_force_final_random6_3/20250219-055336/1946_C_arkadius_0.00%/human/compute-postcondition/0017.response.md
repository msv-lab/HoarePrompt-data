Output State: **`tree` is an instance of the Tree class representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `beg` must be less than `end`, and `end` is now `mid - 1`.** 

The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
