The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`. The loop can execute again if there are more elements in `tree.vertices[v].children` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `u` was the first element in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must not be empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must now be the second element in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must still have at least one more element to iterate over (i.e., it must have at least 2 elements).

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 elements, and `u` is the second element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
