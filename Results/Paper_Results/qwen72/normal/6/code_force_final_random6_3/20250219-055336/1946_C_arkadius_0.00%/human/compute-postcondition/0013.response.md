To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and the behavior of the `func_4` function. However, the function `func_4` is not provided in the code snippet, so we need to infer its behavior based on the given initial state and common programming patterns.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\).
- `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n-1` edges have been added to the `tree` connecting the nodes as specified by the pairs of integers `u` and `v` provided by the user.
- The root of the `tree` is node 0, and its parent is set to -1.

### Assumptions:
- `func_4` is likely a function that operates on the `tree` and the integers `n` and `k`.
- Since `tree` is a connected graph (a tree) with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, and the root is node 0, `func_4` might be performing some operation related to the structure of the tree or the properties of the nodes.

### Possible Function Behavior:
- `func_4` could be calculating the number of nodes at a certain depth or level in the tree.
- `func_4` could be calculating the size of the largest or smallest subtree.
- `func_4` could be performing a specific traversal or query on the tree.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Tree Structure**: The tree is a connected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, rooted at node 0.
2. **Function Call**: The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called with the `tree` instance, the number of nodes `n`, and an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
3. **Output Determination**: Without the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's potential behavior.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we can only describe the output in a general way based on the given initial state.

Output: **[result of func_4(tree, n, k)] (where the result depends on the specific implementation of `func_4`, which operates on the tree with `n` nodes and an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k < n\))**
