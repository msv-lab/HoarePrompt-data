Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) are correctly implemented to construct and root the tree. The `add_edge` method adds edges bidirectionally, and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method ensures that the tree is rooted and the `subtree_size` for each node is calculated correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a non-recursive approach to traverse the tree in a post-order manner. It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on the conditions provided in the problem description. Specifically, it counts the number of good components (subtrees with `remaining_size` >= `x`) and sums the sizes of the remaining components (subtrees with `remaining_size` < `x`).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is a recursive version of `func_1` and performs the same task. It correctly calculates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each subtree. However, it is not used in the main flow of the program, so its presence does not affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`. It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the entire tree and then applies the conditions to determine if the current `x` is valid.

5. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions in `func_3`. The binary search is correctly implemented, and it ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.

6. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`. It correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Each function performs its intended task, and the overall flow of the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
