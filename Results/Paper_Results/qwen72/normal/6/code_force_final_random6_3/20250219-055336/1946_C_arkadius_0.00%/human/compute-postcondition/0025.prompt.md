You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of the Tree class with at least v as a vertex, v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and x is a positive integer.
def func_2(tree, v, x):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: `tree` is an instance of the Tree class with at least `v` as a vertex, `v` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a positive integer, `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values returned by `func_2` for each child of `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`, `remaining_size` is 1 plus the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values for children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values for each child of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is 1 plus the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values for children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a `Tree` instance `tree`, a non-negative integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x`. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of `good_components_subtree` values for each child of `v` plus the number of children with `remaining_size_subtree` ≥ `x`, and `remaining_size`, which is 1 plus the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` values for children with `remaining_size_subtree` < `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values for each child of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is 1 plus the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values for children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
