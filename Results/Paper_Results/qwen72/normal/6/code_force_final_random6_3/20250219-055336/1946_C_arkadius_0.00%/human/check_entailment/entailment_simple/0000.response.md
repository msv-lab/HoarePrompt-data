### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization:**
   - The `Tree` class is correctly defined to represent a tree with `TreeNode` objects. Each `TreeNode` has attributes for edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   - The `Tree` class initializes `n` vertices and provides methods to add edges and root the tree.

2. **Rooting the Tree:**
   - The `root_tree` method recursively sets the parent and children relationships and calculates the subtree size for each node.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method does the same but in a non-recursive manner using a stack, which is important for handling large trees without hitting recursion limits.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree, calculating the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree for each node.
   - The `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated correctly based on the children's values.
   - The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the root node.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is a recursive version of `func_1` and performs the same calculations.
   - It is not used in the final solution but is provided as an alternative approach.

5. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the root node.
   - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
   - It returns `False` otherwise.

6. **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It calls `func_3` with different values of `x` to determine the feasibility.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x`.

7. **Function 5 (`func_5`):**
   - This function reads the input for each test case, initializes the tree, adds the edges, roots the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and processes the input as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
- The use of binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
- The tree is correctly rooted and the necessary calculations are performed accurately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
