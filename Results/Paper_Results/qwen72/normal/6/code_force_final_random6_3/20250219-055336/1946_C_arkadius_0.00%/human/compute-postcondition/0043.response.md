Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before. If `postorder` is False, `stack` is updated to include the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and for each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]`, the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.***
