Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `v` is equal to `s`, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
