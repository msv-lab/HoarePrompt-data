You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_5()`. The function reads input values directly, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and the subsequent `n-1` lines contain pairs of integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n-1` edges have been added to the `tree` connecting the nodes as specified by the pairs of integers `u` and `v` provided by the user.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: [result of func_4(tree, n, k)] (where the result depends on the specific implementation of `func_4`, which operates on the tree with `n` nodes and an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k < n\))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input values for integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of a tree. It processes this input and returns a result based on the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
