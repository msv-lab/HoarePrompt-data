Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 9 + 4 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the most recent `result`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `PB = int(data[index + 2])` updates the value of `PB` to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- All other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `k`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `result`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
