Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game mechanics, including the detection of cycles in the permutation and the calculation of scores for both players. The `calculate_score` function ensures that the score is computed accurately by following the rules of the game, and the `func_1` function compares the scores to determine the winner. The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem's input and output requirements. The program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, making it a correct solution.
