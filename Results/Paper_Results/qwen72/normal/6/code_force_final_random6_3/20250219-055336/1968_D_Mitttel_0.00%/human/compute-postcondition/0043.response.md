The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not directly relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element. The variable `result` will be the first element in the `results` list at the start of the loop.

State: **`results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration and must have at least one element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list**
