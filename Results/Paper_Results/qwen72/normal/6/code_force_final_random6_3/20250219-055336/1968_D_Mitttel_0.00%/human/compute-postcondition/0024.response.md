Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 9 + 2 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the list `p` to contain integers from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and ending at `index + n`.
- The value of `index` is calculated as `9 + 2 * n`, where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- The new `p` list is derived from the slice of `data` specified by `index` and `n`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
