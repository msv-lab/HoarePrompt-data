### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it in a loop.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these values and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of positions and the step at which they were visited to detect cycles.
   - The function iterates up to `k` steps, adding the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to the score and moving to the next position `p[current_pos - 1]`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position has been visited before), it calculates the cycle length and the score for one full cycle.
   - It then calculates the number of full cycles that can be completed in the remaining steps and adds the corresponding score.
   - Finally, it adds the score for the remaining steps that do not complete a full cycle.
   - This part of the code is also correct and efficiently handles the cycle detection and score calculation.

3. **Game Result Determination (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `calculate_score`.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.
   - This part of the code is correct and accurately determines the winner based on the scores.

### Potential Issues:
- **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
  - The cycle detection and handling in `calculate_score` are correct. It correctly identifies cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps after the cycle is detected.
- **Indexing**:
  - The indexing in the permutation and array `a` is correct. Both are 1-indexed in the problem statement, and the code correctly adjusts for 0-indexed lists by subtracting 1 from the position indices.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when the starting positions are the same.
- **Efficiency**:
  - The code is efficient in handling the constraints, especially in detecting cycles and calculating the score for large `k` values.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints. It correctly handles the input, detects cycles, and calculates the scores for both players. The final result is determined accurately.

Final: **True**
