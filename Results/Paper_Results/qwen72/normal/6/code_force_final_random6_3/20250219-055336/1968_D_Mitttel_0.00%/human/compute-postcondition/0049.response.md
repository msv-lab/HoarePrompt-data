Output State: **The `results` list is fully iterated, and all elements in the `results` list have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, every value that was stored in the `results` list has been printed to the console. The loop has completed its execution, and there are no more elements left to print from the `results` list. The state of other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`) remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
