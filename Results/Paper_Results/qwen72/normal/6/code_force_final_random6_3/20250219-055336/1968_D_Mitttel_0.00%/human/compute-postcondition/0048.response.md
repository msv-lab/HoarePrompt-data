Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
   - The list `results` must have at least three elements.
   - `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the third element of the `results` list.
   - Since `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, the third element of `results` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` during the third iteration.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the value of the third element in the `results` list.
   - This value is the result of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` during the third iteration.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` during the third iteration)**
