The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the list `a` by converting a slice of `data` from index `index` to `index + n` into integers. 

Given the initial state:
- `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- `data` is a list of strings split from the input.
- `index` is 9 + 3 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * n]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).
- `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).

The impact of the code:
- `a` is updated to a list of integers from the slice `data[index:index + n]`.

Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 9 + 3 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).**
