Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary parameters for each test case.
   - The parameters are correctly parsed and passed to `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results of each test case are collected in a list and printed at the end.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - The function iterates up to `k` steps, adding the value of `a` at the current position to the score and updating the current position based on the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position is already in `visited`), it calculates the cycle length and the score for one full cycle.
   - It then calculates the number of full cycles that can fit into the remaining steps and updates the score accordingly.
   - Finally, it handles the remaining steps outside the full cycles to ensure the score is accurate.

3. **Winner Determination (`func_1`)**:
   - The function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It compares the scores and returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison.

The program correctly handles the following aspects:
- **Cycle Detection**: The `calculate_score` function detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps efficiently.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The `func_2` function processes multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1, when the starting positions are the same, and when the permutation and array are of different lengths (though the problem guarantees valid inputs).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
