Output State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is incremented by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration, `cycle_pos` is updated to `p[cycle_pos - 1]` after each iteration, the loop executes `cycle_length` times, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score` and `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

The value of `score` is incremented by `a[current_pos - 1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
