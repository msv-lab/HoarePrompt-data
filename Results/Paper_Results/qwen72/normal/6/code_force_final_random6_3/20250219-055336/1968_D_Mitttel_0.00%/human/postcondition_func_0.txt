The function `func_1` takes in five parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), `PB` (an integer such that 1 <= PB <= n), `PS` (an integer such that 1 <= PS <= n), `p` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length n where 1 <= p[i] <= n), and `a` (a list of positive integers of length n where 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9). It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their positions `PB` and `PS` respectively. The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal.
