Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract the necessary parameters for each test case. It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. The indices are updated appropriately to move to the next set of parameters.

2. **Score Calculation in `calculate_score`**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly calculates the score for a player starting at position `start_pos` for `k` turns.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
   - The function ensures that the score is updated correctly by summing the elements of `a` at the positions determined by the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha with their respective starting positions `PB` and `PS`.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal.

4. **Overall Program Structure**:
   - The program structure is correct. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - The functions `func_1` and `calculate_score` are logically sound and handle the problem requirements as described.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the score calculation and comparison are done correctly.

Correctness: **True**
