The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200. Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**
