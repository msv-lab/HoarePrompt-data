The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even and the length of the string generated by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string. If the length of the generated string is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
