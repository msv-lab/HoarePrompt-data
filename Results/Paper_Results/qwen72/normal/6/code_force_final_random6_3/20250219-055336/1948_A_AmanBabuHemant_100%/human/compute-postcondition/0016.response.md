Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200.
   - Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'NO'.
   - The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `s` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always output 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is always 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
