Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, `s` is not defined.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is greater than or equal to 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'YES'.
   - The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` do not affect the output of this `print` statement.
   - The definition and length of `s` also do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference `s`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or the definition of `s`.

Output: **YES**
