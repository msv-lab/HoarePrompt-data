Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer, and it is even.
   - `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(s)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer.
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is guaranteed to be less than 200.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`.
   - The string `s` will be 'AAB' repeated 3 times, resulting in `s = 'AABAABAAB'`.
   - The length of `s` is 9, which is less than 200.

5. **General Case:**
   - For any even `n`, the string `s` will be 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than 200.

Therefore, the output will be the string `s` consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times (where `n` is an even integer and the length of the string is less than 200)**
