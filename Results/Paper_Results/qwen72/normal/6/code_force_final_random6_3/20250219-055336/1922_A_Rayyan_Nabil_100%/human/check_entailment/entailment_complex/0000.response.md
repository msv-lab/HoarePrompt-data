Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four parameters: `n` (the length of the strings), `a`, `b`, and `c` (the strings themselves).
   - It iterates over each character index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is met for any index `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an index, it returns 'NO'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly checks if there exists an index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
  - If such an index exists, it means that `a` and `b` can match a template where the corresponding position is an uppercase letter of `c[i]`, and `c` cannot match this template.
  - If no such index exists, it means that for every position `i`, at least one of `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, making it impossible to construct a template that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the input values and calls `func_1` with these values.
  - It collects the results and prints them, ensuring that the output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. Both functions work as intended, and the overall structure of the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
