Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
2. `_` is `t - 1`.
3. `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
4. `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
5. `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
6. `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
7. `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times.
8. `results` must have at least 2 elements.
9. `result` is the second element in the `results` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`t` and `_`**:
   - `t` is a number that must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `_` is calculated as `t - 1`.

2. **`n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`**:
   - `n` is an integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

3. **`results`**:
   - `results` is a list that contains the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times.
   - Since `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `results` must have at least 2 elements, `t` must be at least 2.

4. **`result`**:
   - `result` is the second element in the `results` list.
   - Given that `results` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the second iteration.

### Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the second iteration. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical or string value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `result`.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the second iteration)**
