Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for each position `i`, the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the same template, and it also does not handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, which should still be valid as long as `c[i]` is different.

A counterexample is:
```
Input:
1
3
abc
abc
xyz

Output:
NO
```
In this case, the strings `a` and `b` are identical and should match the template "abc" (where all characters are lowercase and must match exactly). The string `c` is "xyz", which does not match the template "abc" because none of its characters are the same as the corresponding characters in the template. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". This demonstrates that the program is incorrect.
