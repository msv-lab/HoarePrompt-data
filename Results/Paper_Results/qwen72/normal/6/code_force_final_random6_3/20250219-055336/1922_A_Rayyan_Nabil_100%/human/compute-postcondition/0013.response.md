Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` twice.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
- The code snippet `results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))` appends the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`.
- Therefore, after executing the code, `results` now contains the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` twice.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
