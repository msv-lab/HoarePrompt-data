Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, `results` must have `t` elements, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same, as it determines the number of iterations.
- The variable `_` is still `t-1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The `results` list has exactly `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
- All elements in the `results` list have been printed, one per iteration of the loop.
