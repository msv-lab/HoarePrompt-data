To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `_` is `t-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times.
   - `results` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `result` is the second element in the `results` list.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for result in results:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop will execute again if there is a next element in the `results` list.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `result` was the second element in the `results` list.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `result` must be the third element in the `results` list.
   - The `results` list must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

4. **New State:**
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `_` is `t-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `results` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in the `results` list**
