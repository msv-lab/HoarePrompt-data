### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - The loop iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is met for any position `i`, the function returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a position, the function returns 'NO'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and calls `func_1` with these parameters, appending the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**:
     - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`.
     - `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]` (both 'a' and 'b' are different from 'c').
     - The function should return 'YES', which it does.
   - **Test Case 2**:
     - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`.
     - For `i = 0`, `a[0] == c[0]` (both are 'a').
     - For `i = 1`, `a[1] == c[1]` (both are 'a').
     - The function should return 'NO', which it does.
   - **Test Case 3**:
     - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`.
     - For `i = 0`, `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]` (both 'm' and 'l' are different from 'a').
     - The function should return 'YES', which it does.
   - **Test Case 4**:
     - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`.
     - For `i = 0`, `a[0] == c[0]` (both are 'a').
     - For `i = 1`, `a[1] == c[1]` (both are 'c').
     - For `i = 2`, `b[2] == c[2]` (both are 'c').
     - The function should return 'NO', which it does.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1`.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n = 20` (the maximum value for `n`).

5. **General Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks the conditions for each character position.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases. It correctly determines whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.

Correctness: **True**
