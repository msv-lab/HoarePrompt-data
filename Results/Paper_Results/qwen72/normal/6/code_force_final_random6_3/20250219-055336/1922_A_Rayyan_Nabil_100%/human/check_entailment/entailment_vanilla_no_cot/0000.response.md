Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if for each position `i` in the strings, the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a template exists where `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

The correct approach should ensure that:
1. For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have that lowercase character at position `i`.
2. For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template must have an uppercase character at position `i` that does not match the lowercase version of `c[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template is constructed correctly and checks if `c` can be excluded based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
