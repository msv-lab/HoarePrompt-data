You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results of calling `func_1` for each test case have been printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - The template `t` can have lowercase and uppercase letters.
   - For a string to match the template:
     - If the template has a lowercase letter at position `i`, the string must have the same letter at position `i`.
     - If the template has an uppercase letter at position `i`, the string must have a different letter at position `i`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is supposed to check if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
   - The function iterates over each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is true for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list `results`.

4. **Correctness of Function 1**:
   - The function correctly checks if there exists a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it is possible to construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase version of `c[i]`, making `a` and `b` match the template but `c` not match it.
   - If no such position exists, it is impossible to construct such a template, and the function correctly returns 'NO'.

5. **Correctness of Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It correctly prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly determines if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.

Correctness: **True**
