Postcondition: ***`s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed), `i` has iterated through each character in `s` and is now incremented by 1, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `len(a) > 1`, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. If `len(a) <= 1`, the length of `a` is 1 or less.***
