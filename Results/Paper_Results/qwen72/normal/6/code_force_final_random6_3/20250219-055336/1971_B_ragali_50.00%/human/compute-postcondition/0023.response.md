Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is not relevant, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` with a size greater than 1, `newstr` is the second half of `s` concatenated with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed version of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is checked: if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is not equal to `s`; if `isreverse` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s`.**
