The function reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from user input. If the string `s` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of `s`: either a rotated version (second half concatenated with the first half), a reversed version, or a modified version (second half concatenated with the first half again), depending on the conditions checked. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function ends.
