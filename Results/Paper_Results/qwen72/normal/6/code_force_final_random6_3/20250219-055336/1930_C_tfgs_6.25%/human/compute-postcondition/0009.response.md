Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, ..., `a[n-1]` is increased by `n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`.**
