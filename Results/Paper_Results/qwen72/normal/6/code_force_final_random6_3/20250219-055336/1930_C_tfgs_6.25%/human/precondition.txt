t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
