Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are a few issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already all the same elements correctly. While it does return `0` for such cases, it does so in a way that might not be robust for all edge cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The logic in `func_1` to find the minimum cost is flawed. The program tries to find the first and last indices where the elements are different and then calculates the cost based on these indices. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal by choosing the most frequent element and minimizing the cost.

3. **Suboptimal Cost Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the most frequent element is not at the edges of the array. It should consider the cost of making all elements equal to the most frequent element, which might involve a different range of indices.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
1. Identify the most frequent element in the array.
2. Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
3. If the array is already all the same, return `0`.
4. Otherwise, return the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common_element, most_common_count = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    # If the most common element is the only element, return 0
    if most_common_count == len(arr):
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most common element
    min_cost = len(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == most_common_element:
            for j in range(i, len(arr)):
                if arr[j] == most_common_element:
                    min_cost = min(min_cost, j - i + 1)
    
    return min_cost
```

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum cost to make all elements equal, considering the most frequent element and the optimal range of indices to apply the operation.
