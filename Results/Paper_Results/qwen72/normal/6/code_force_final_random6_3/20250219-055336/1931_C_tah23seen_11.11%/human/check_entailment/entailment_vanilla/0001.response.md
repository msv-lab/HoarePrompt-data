Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The function initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop to check if the elements at the pointers `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward. This loop continues until `i` is greater than `j` or the elements at the pointers are not equal.
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the array is already a palindrome, and no operation is needed, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at the pointers are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.
   - The next loop checks if the element at `i` is equal to the element at `i + 1`. If they are, it increments `i` to skip over consecutive equal elements.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (inclusive), which is `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` (exclusive), which is `j - i`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of the function is to find the smallest subarray that needs to be modified to make the entire array equal.
   - The first loop ensures that the outermost elements that are already equal are skipped, which is a good approach to minimize the cost.
   - The second loop ensures that consecutive equal elements are also skipped, which is another good optimization.
   - However, the logic for determining the cost when `j` is the last index is incorrect. It should always return `j - i + 1` because the cost is based on the number of elements being modified, not whether `j` is the last index.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array is already equal (returns 0).
   - It also handles the case where the array has only one element (returns 0).
   - However, the logic for the case where the array has two different elements (e.g., [1, 2]) is incorrect. It should return 1, but the current logic might return 0 or 2 depending on the initial values of `i` and `j`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is mostly correct but has a logical flaw in the final return statement. It should always return `j - i + 1` to correctly account for the cost of modifying the subarray.

Correctness: **False**
