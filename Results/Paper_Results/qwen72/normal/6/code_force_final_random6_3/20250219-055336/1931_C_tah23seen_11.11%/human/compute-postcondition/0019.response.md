Output State: **If the loop completes all iterations, then `i` is `len(arr) // 2` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is even, or `i` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is odd. If the loop breaks early, then `i` and `j` are the indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means that the list `arr` is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). In this case, the indices `i` and `j` will have moved towards the center of the list. If the length of `arr` is even, both `i` and `j` will end up at the middle indices. If the length of `arr` is odd, `i` will be just past the middle index, and `j` will be just before the middle index.
- If the loop breaks early, it means that the list `arr` is not a palindrome, and the loop will stop at the first pair of indices where the elements are not equal. The values of `i` and `j` will be the indices of this mismatch.
