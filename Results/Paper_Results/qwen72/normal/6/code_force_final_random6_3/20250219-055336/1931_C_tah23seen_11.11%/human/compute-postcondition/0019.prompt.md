Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr), `i` is 0, `j` is len(arr) - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= j:
    if arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr). If `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is len(arr) - 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is len(arr) - 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `len(arr) - 3`, and `len(arr) - 3` must be greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `len(arr) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1. If the condition `len(arr) - 2` or `len(arr) - 3` is not met, the loop or if statement is broken and no further adjustments are needed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and `len(arr) >= 5`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 3 and `j` is `len(arr) - 4`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `len(arr) - 2`. If the else part is executed, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
