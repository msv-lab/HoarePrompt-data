Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr), `i` is 1, `j` is len(arr) - 1, and the first element of `arr` (arr[0]) is equal to the last element of `arr` (arr[j]).**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
