Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of making all elements of an array equal with the minimum cost, where the cost is defined as the number of elements that need to be changed. The function `func_1` follows a specific logic to determine this minimum cost:

1. **Initial Check for Palindrome:**
   - The function first checks if the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and end, moving towards the center. If the array is a palindrome, it returns 0 because no changes are needed.

2. **Finding the First Mismatch:**
   - If the array is not a palindrome, the function identifies the first indices `i` and `j` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. This is done by breaking out of the loop as soon as a mismatch is found.

3. **Handling Consecutive Equal Elements:**
   - After finding the first mismatch, the function checks if there are consecutive elements from `i` onwards that are equal. This is to ensure that the cost is calculated correctly, avoiding unnecessary operations.

4. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The function then calculates the cost based on the indices `i` and `j`:
     - If `j` is not the last index, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array equal.
     - If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`, which is also the number of elements that need to be changed.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Handling Consecutive Equal Elements:**
  - The loop `while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]: i += 1` only handles the case where `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. It does not handle the case where `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. This can lead to incorrect results if the array has a different pattern of consecutive equal elements at the end.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The function does not handle the case where the array is already equal (all elements are the same). In such a case, the function should return 0, but it might not if the array is not a palindrome but all elements are the same.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation `j - i + 1` is correct if `j` is not the last index. However, the final return statement `return j - i` is incorrect because it should always return `j - i + 1` to account for the inclusive range.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly handle all edge cases and might return incorrect results in some scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
