Output State: **`i` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`**. 

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1, and it is now less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`. Additionally, the element at the new index `i` in the array `arr` is equal to the element at the previous index `i - 1`.
