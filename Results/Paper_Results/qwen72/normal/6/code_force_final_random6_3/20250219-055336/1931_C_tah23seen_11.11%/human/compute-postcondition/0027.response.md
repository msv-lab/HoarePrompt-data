The variables in the loop head are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the equality of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i-1]` must be equal to `arr[i]`, and `i` is less than or equal to `len(arr)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[i]` must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Since `i` is less than or equal to `len(arr)`, and the loop condition involves `arr[i + 1]`, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1` to ensure that `arr[i + 1]` is a valid index.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
