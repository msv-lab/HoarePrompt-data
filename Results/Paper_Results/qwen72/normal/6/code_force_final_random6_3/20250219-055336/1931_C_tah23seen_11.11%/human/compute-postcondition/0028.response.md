Output State: **`i` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` is no longer strictly true, but `i` is now less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`. If `i` is still less than `len(arr) - 1`, then `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
