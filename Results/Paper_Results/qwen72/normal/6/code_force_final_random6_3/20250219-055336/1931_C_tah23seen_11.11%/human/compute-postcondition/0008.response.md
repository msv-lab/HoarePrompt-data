Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr). If `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is len(arr) - 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is len(arr) - 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
