Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, starting from the last element. The variable `i` will be updated to `len(a) - 1`, reflecting the new length of the list `a` after the trailing zeros have been removed. The variables `t`, `res`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
