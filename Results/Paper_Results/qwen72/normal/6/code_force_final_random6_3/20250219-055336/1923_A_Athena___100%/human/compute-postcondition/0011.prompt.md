Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip), and at least one cell contains a chip. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50. `a` is now a list of integers input by the user, each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `a` is `n`. `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[0] == 0:
    a.pop(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n - 1` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip), and at least one cell contains a chip. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50. `a` is now a list of integers input by the user, each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `a` is `n - 1`. `res` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is now a list of integers input by the user, each element is either 0 or 1, the length of `a` is `n - 2`, and `res` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is now a list of integers input by the user, each element is either 0 or 1, the length of `a` is `n - 3`, and `res` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
