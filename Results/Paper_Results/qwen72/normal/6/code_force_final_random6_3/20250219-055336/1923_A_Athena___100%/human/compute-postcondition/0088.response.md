Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer. If the first element of `a` is 0 or `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 0.***
