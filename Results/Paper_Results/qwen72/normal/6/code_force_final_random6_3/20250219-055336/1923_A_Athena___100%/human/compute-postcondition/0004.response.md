Output State: **`func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip), and at least one cell contains a chip. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50. `a` is now a list of integers input by the user, each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `a` is `n`. `res` is 0.**
