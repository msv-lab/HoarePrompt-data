The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers with at least one trailing zero, the last element is a zero. After executing the code, the list `a` will have one fewer element, and this element will no longer be a trailing zero. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and has at least one fewer trailing zero, `i` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0**
