The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, and it must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The list `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue, but since `i` is now 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is 1.**
