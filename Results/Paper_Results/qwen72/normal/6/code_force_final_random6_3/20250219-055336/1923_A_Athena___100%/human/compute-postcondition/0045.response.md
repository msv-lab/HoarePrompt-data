Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation:
- The last element of `a` is removed by `a.pop()`, so `a` is now a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is no longer 0.
- The value of `i` is updated to `len(a) - 1` because the length of `a` has decreased by 1.
- The values of `t`, `res`, and `n` remain unchanged.
