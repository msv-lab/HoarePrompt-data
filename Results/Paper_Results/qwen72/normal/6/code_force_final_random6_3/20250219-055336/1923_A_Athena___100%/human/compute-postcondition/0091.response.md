Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is the index of the last element of `a`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a` for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The list `a` has been processed to remove all leading and trailing zeros for each test case.
- The variable `i` is the index of the last element in the processed list `a`.
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer for each test case.
- The variable `res` holds the number of zeros in the processed list `a` for each test case, and this value is printed for each test case.
