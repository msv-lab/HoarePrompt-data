Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the correct logic for computing the MEX of a subarray and applying the operations to maximize the sum.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
The actual output of the provided program will not match the expected output because the functions do not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and apply the operations as required.

The program should:
1. Identify the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum.
2. Apply the operation to replace the elements in the subarray with the MEX.
3. Repeat the process until no further improvement can be made, ensuring the total number of operations does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

The provided functions do not correctly handle these steps, leading to incorrect results.
