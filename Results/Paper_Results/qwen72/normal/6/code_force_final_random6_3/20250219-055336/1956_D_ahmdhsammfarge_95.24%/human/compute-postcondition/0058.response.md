The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers with a length `n` where 1 <= n <= 18. The function returns two values: `i` and `j`. `i` is the value where the maximum `sm` was found (`r`), and `j` is the value where the maximum `sm` was found (`l`). Specifically, `r` is `n-1` and `l` is `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` of integers with a length between 1 and 18, and returns two values: `i` and `j`. `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `lst`.**
