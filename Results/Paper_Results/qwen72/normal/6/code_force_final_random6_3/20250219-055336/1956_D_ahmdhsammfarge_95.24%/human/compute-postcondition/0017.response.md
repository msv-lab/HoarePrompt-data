Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, and `over_sum` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.**

Explanation: The code `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. According to the initial state, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`. Since `sm` is greater than `over_sum` in the initial state, `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`, and `l` is set to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
