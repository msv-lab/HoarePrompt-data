Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus `1`, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is recalculated as the sum of all elements in `lst` from the start up to index `i-1` (which is `lst[:1]`), plus the sum of all elements in `lst` from index `j+1` to the end (which is `lst[3:]`), plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`, which is `1` (since `j` is 2 and `i` is 1).
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.
