The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(lst)`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 5. For the loop to execute again, `len(lst)` must be greater than 5.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 5 to `n-1` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 4, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
