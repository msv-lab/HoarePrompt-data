The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. The previous values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 4, so `r` is now 2 and `l` is now 4. The other variables (`lst`, `sm`, `over_sum`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 5 to `n-1` plus 9, `r` is 2, `l` is 4, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
