Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 9, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is 0, and `l` is 2.**

The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is already defined as the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 9, `over_sum` now holds this same value. All other variables remain unchanged.
