        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:

    #State: `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 18`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `r` is the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found (`r`), and the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found (`l`). `r` is `n-1` and `l` is `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers with a length between 1 and 18. It calculates the maximum possible sum of the elements outside a subarray of `lst` plus the square of the length of that subarray. The function returns two integers, `r` and `l`, which represent the starting and ending indices of the subarray that results in this maximum sum. After the function concludes, `lst` remains unchanged, and `r` and `l` are the indices that define the subarray contributing to the maximum sum.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that r <= l, and ops is a list that can store lists of integers.
def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])

    #State: r and l are non-negative integers such that r < l, and ops is a list that can store lists of integers.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can store lists of integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, depending on the values of `r` and `l`. The function does not return any value, but the `ops` list will contain the appended pairs after the function concludes. The number of appended pairs is determined by the difference between `l` and `r`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: `lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` contains `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` such that each element in this sublist is set to the length of the sublist (`n`). The function also appends several lists to `ops`, including `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times and `[r + 1, r + 1]` once. The function returns the modified list `lst`, ensuring that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
