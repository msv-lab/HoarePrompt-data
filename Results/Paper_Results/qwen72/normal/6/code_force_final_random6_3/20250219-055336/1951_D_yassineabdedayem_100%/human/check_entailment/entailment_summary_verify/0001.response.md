Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice has \( n \) coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \( 10^{18} \).
   - Alice buys jewels greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she can't buy any more jewels.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks three conditions to determine if Bob can set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly \( k \) jewels.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: If \( n = k \), Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
     - This is correct because if \( n = k \), Alice can buy \( k \) jewels at 1 coin each, and she will have 0 coins left.
     - Output: "YES", 1, 1
   - **Condition 2**: If \( n + 2 > k * 2 \), Bob can set up two stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
     - This condition simplifies to \( n + 2 > 2k \) or \( n > 2k - 2 \).
     - If \( n > 2k - 2 \), Alice can buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
     - The first stall price is \( n - k + 1 \), which ensures that Alice spends \( (n - k + 1) \times (k - 1) \) coins on the first stall.
     - The second stall price is 1, and Alice will have \( n - (n - k + 1) \times (k - 1) \) coins left, which is enough to buy 1 more jewel.
     - Output: "YES", 2, \( n - k + 1 \), 1
   - **Condition 3**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO".
     - This is correct because if \( n \leq 2k - 2 \), it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
     - Output: "NO"

4. **Output Format**:
   - If the answer is "YES", the program prints the number of stalls and the prices.
   - The number of stalls is either 1 or 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.
   - The prices are within the valid range of 1 to \( 10^{18} \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When \( n = k \), it prints "YES" with 1 stall priced at 1.
     - When \( n > 2k - 2 \), it prints "YES" with 2 stalls priced appropriately.
     - When \( n \leq 2k - 2 \), it prints "NO".

6. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 3 \)
     - \( n > 2k - 2 \) is \( 7 > 4 \), which is true.
     - Output: "YES", 2, 5, 1
     - Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall (5 coins each, spending 5 coins, 2 coins left) and 1 jewel from the second stall (1 coin each, spending 1 coin, 1 coin left).
     - Total: 3 jewels, which matches \( k \).
   - **Example 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 4 \)
     - \( n > 2k - 2 \) is \( 6 > 6 \), which is false.
     - Output: "NO"
   - **Example 3**: \( n = 255 \), \( k = 8 \)
     - \( n > 2k - 2 \) is \( 255 > 14 \), which is true.
     - Output: "YES", 2, 248, 1
     - Alice buys 7 jewels from the first stall (248 coins each, spending 1736 coins, 255 coins left) and 1 jewel from the second stall (1 coin each, spending 1 coin, 0 coins left).
     - Total: 8 jewels, which matches \( k \).

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
