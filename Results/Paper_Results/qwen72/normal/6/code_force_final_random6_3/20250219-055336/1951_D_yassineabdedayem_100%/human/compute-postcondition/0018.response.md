The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `n` and `k` as input integers are updated based on the new input. The value of `t` remains greater than 1, and the value of `_` remains 1. The conditions involving `n` and `k` will be evaluated based on the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are the new input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds; otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
