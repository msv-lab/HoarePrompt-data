The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 1 and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds; otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
