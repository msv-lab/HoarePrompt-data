Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is very straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
- The value `1` is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **1**
