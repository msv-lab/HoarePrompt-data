Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice has \( n \) coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \( 10^{18} \).
   - Alice buys jewels greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she can't buy any more jewels.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks three conditions to determine if Bob can set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly \( k \) jewels.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: If \( n = k \), Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
     - This is correct because if \( n = k \), Alice can buy \( k \) jewels at 1 coin each, and she will have 0 coins left.
   - **Condition 2**: If \( n + 2 > k * 2 \), Bob can set up two stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
     - This condition simplifies to \( n + 2 > 2k \) or \( n > 2k - 2 \).
     - If \( n > 2k - 2 \), Alice can buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
     - The first stall price is \( n - k + 1 \), which ensures that Alice spends \( (n - k + 1) \times (k - 1) \) coins on the first stall.
     - The second stall price is 1, and Alice will have \( n - (n - k + 1) \times (k - 1) \) coins left, which is enough to buy 1 more jewel.
   - **Condition 3**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO".
     - This is correct because if \( n \leq 2k - 2 \), it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

4. **Output Format**:
   - If the answer is "YES", the program prints the number of stalls and the prices.
   - The number of stalls is either 1 or 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.
   - The prices are within the valid range of 1 to \( 10^{18} \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When \( n = k \), it prints "YES" with 1 stall priced at 1.
     - When \( n > 2k - 2 \), it prints "YES" with 2 stalls priced appropriately.
     - When \( n \leq 2k - 2 \), it prints "NO".

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
