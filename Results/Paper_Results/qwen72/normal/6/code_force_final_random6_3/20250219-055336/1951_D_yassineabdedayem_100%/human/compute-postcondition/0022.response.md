Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are new input integers.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.
- Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and:
  - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds.
  - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides conditions and values for variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **YES**
