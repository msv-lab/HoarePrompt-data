The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

Let's break down the initial state and determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are new input integers.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds.
   - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `2`.
   - The value `2` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the `print` statement is `print(2)`, it will always print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
