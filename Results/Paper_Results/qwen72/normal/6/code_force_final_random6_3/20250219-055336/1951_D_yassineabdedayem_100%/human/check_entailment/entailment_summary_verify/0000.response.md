### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies two critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Case where `k` is greater than `n`:**
   - The program does not handle the scenario where Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 5`, Alice cannot buy 5 jewels with only 3 coins. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" and a pricing strategy that does not meet the requirement.

2. **Case where `k` is greater than 60:**
   - The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, regardless of the pricing strategy. For example, if `n = 100` and `k = 61`, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" and a pricing strategy that does not meet the requirement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **First Condition (`n == k`):**
  - This condition correctly handles the case where Alice has exactly `k` coins. In this case, Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. This is a valid solution.

- **Second Condition (`n + 2 > k * 2`):**
  - This condition is intended to handle cases where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. However, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is not always correct. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the condition `3 + 2 > 5 * 2` (which simplifies to `5 > 10`) is false, but the program should still output "NO" because Alice cannot buy 5 jewels with only 3 coins. The condition should be `n >= k` to ensure Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels.

- **Third Condition (`else`):**
  - This condition handles cases where neither of the above conditions is met. However, it does not consider the constraint that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. If `k` is greater than 60, the program should output "NO" because it is impossible to set up more than 60 stalls.

### Corrected Program:

To correct the program, we need to handle the following cases:
1. If `n < k`, output "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.
2. If `k > 60`, output "NO" because Bob cannot set up more than 60 stalls.
3. If `n == k`, output "YES" followed by a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
4. If `n >= k` and `k <= 60`, output "YES" followed by a valid pricing strategy for `k` stalls.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if n < k:
            print('NO')
        elif k > 60:
            print('NO')
        elif n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(k)
            for i in range(k):
                print(n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0), end=' ')
            print()

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **First Condition (`n < k`):**
  - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible, so we output "NO".

- **Second Condition (`k > 60`):**
  - If Bob needs Alice to buy more than 60 jewels, it is impossible because Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, so we output "NO".

- **Third Condition (`n == k`):**
  - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, we set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, so she buys exactly `k` jewels. We output "YES" followed by the number 1 and the price 1.

- **Fourth Condition (`n >= k` and `k <= 60`):**
  - If Alice has enough coins and `k` is within the limit of 60, we set up `k` stalls. The price for each stall is calculated as `n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0)`, which ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. We output "YES" followed by the number `k` and the prices for each stall.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when `n < k` or `k > 60`.

Final: **False**
