Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to determine if Bob can set up a series of stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers `n` and `k`.

1. **First Condition (`n == k`)**:
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is a straightforward case where the function correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1.

2. **Second Condition (`n + 2 > k * 2`)**:
   - This condition checks if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic here is that if `n + 2` is greater than `2 * k`, then Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The condition `n + 2 > 2 * k` simplifies to `n > 2 * k - 2`, which means Alice has enough coins to buy `k - 1` jewels at a higher price and 1 jewel at a lower price. This is a valid and correct approach.

3. **Third Condition (`else`)**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "NO". This is correct because if `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is not greater than `2 * k`, it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This is because Alice would not have enough coins to buy the required number of jewels even if the prices were optimized.

The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. It ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, and the prices are within the allowed range. The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
