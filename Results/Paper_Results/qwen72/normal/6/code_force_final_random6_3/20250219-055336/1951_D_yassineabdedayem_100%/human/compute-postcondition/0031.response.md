Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are new input integers.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds.
- Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
2. The initial state provides conditions for `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
