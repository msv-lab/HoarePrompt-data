### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the standard input.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels (since `n` coins are exactly enough to buy `k` jewels at 1 coin each).

3. **Second Condition:**
   - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1. This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels:
     - At the first stall, Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels (since `n - k + 1` coins are enough to buy `k - 1` jewels).
     - At the second stall, Alice will buy 1 jewel (since the price is 1 coin).
     - This sums up to `k` jewels, which is the desired outcome.

4. **Else Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions holds, the program prints "NO". This is correct because if `n + 2 <= k * 2`, it means that Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints (i.e., she would need more than 60 stalls or the prices would not allow her to buy exactly `k` jewels).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the base case where `n == k`.
- The program correctly handles the case where `n + 2 > k * 2` by setting up two stalls with the appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The program correctly handles the case where `n + 2 <= k * 2` by printing "NO" because it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
