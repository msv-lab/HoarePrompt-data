Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 1.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` and `k` are new input integers.
4. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.
5. Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds.
6. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the conditions provided for `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
