The code snippet `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `n` and `k` are the new input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the new input integers.
- The conditions involving `n` and `k` will be evaluated based on these new values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the new input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
