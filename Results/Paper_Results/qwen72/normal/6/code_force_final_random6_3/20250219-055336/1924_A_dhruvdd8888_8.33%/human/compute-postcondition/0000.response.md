Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. n, k, and m are assigned the values from the input.**
