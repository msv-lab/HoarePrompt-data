### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Set Initialization**:
   - The set `us` is initialized with the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is correct and necessary for the problem.

3. **Window Set and Answer List**:
   - The set `win` is used to track the unique characters in the current window of `s`.
   - The list `ans` is used to store the characters that complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`.

4. **Character Processing**:
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it is added to the set `win`.
   - If the set `win` contains `k` unique characters, the character `i` is added to the list `ans`, and `win` is cleared. This is done to track the completion of a set of `k` unique characters.

5. **Check and Output**:
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if the number of times the set `win` was cleared (`ps`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it prints 'YES' and returns.
   - If `ps < n`, it prints 'NO' and then tries to print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

6. **Generating a Non-Subsequence String**:
   - The program iterates over the set `us` and checks if any character `i` is not in the set `win`.
   - If such a character is found, it prints the string formed by concatenating the list `ans`, the character `i`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`. The program should generate a string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if it is a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The program's logic for generating a string that is not a subsequence of `s` is flawed. It simply adds a character not in `win` and pads the rest with 'a', which does not ensure that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it should be printed as the answer.

### Corrected Approach:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
- Check if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any generated string is not a subsequence, print 'NO' and the string.
- If all generated strings are subsequences, print 'YES'.
