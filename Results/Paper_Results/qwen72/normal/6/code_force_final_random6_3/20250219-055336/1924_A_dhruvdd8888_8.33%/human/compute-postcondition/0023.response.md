Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, `win` is a set containing the third character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the second character of `s`, and `ps` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `win.add(i)` adds the third character of `s` (which is `i`) to the set `win`.
- Since `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k` initially, `win` was an empty set. After adding `i`, `win` now contains the third character of `s`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `ans`, and `ps`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
