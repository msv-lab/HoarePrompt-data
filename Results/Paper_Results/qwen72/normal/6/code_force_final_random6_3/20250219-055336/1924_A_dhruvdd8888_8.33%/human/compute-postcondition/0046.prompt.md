You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared. Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop has iterated over all elements in `us`, and for each element `i` in `us`, if `i` was not in `win`, then the string `ans` followed by `i` and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It prints 'YES' and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
