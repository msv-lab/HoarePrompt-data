The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `us`. For the loop to execute, `us` must contain at least one element. Given the initial state, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `us` will always contain at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `us`.

However, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to the first element of `us` for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`, `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is the first element of `us`**
