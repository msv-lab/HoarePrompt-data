Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Subsequence Check**:
   - The program attempts to track a "window" of characters (`win`) that are part of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.
   - The program clears the `win` set after it reaches the size `k`, which is not a valid way to check for subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Incorrect Output for "NO" Case**:
   - When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences, it prints a string that is not necessarily a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The logic for generating the string to print in the "NO" case is incorrect and does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

3. **Function Call Issue**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but it should be called after the loop to ensure the correct number of test cases are processed.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If all possible strings are subsequences, print "YES".
4. If not, print "NO" and provide an example of a string that is not a subsequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if each possible string is a subsequence of s
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
            print('NO')
            print(possible_string)
            return
    
    print('YES')

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - The `product` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The `is_subsequence` function checks if a string `x` is a subsequence of another string `y` by iterating through `y` and checking if all characters of `x` appear in `y` in the same order.

3. **Check All Possible Strings**:
   - The program iterates through all possible strings and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies whether all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s` and provides a valid example if not.
