The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first character of `s`, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `s`, and `s` must still have at least one more character to iterate over.

Given that `s` has a length `m` and `ps` is 1, indicating that the first character has been processed, the next character to be processed is the second character of `s`. The string `s` must still have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 2. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, then `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, and `ans` is an empty list. If `i` is not in `us`, then `win` remains an empty set, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 1.**
