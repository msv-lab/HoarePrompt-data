Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is an empty list. `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, then `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, and `ans` is an empty list. If `i` is not in `us`, then `win` remains an empty set, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the second character of `s`, and `ps` is 3. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set containing the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, and `ps` is 2. If `i` is not in `us`, `win` remains an empty set, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the second and third characters of `s`, and `ps` is 4. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set containing the third character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the second character of `s`, and `ps` is 3. If `i` is not in `us`, `win` remains an empty set, `ans` remains an empty list, and `ps` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
