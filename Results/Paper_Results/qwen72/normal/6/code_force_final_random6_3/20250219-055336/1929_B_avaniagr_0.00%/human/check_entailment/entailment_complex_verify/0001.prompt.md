You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: `[*open(0)][1:]` is exhausted, and all elements in the list `[*open(0)][1:]` have been processed. For each processed element `s`, `n` and `k` were assigned the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by whitespace, respectively, and the corresponding calculation was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, skipping the first line. For each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and prints a calculated value based on these integers. The calculation is as follows: if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the function prints `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, otherwise, it prints `2 * n` plus 1 if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input source is exhausted, and the calculations for all lines have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total, which include both the main diagonals and the anti-diagonals.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each cell in the grid can be part of up to 4 diagonals (2 main and 2 anti-diagonals).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to maximize the number of diagonals each colored cell can cover.

3. **Solution Breakdown**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it parses the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The formula used to determine the minimum number of cells to color is:
     \[
     \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k >= 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**:
     - Here, \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals minus one.
     - The formula \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) calculates the ceiling of \( k / 2 \). This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, we need one extra cell to cover the remaining diagonal.
   - **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**:
     - Here, \( k \) is close to or equal to the total number of diagonals.
     - The formula \( 2n \) is used because if \( k \) is very close to the total number of diagonals, we need to color almost the entire grid to cover all diagonals.
   - **Case 3: \( k == 4n - 2 \)**:
     - This is a special case where \( k \) is exactly the total number of diagonals.
     - The formula adds 1 to the result, which is necessary because covering all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals requires exactly \( 2n \) cells, plus one additional cell to ensure all diagonals are covered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) by adding 1 to the result.
   - It also handles the case where \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \) by using the ceiling of \( k / 2 \).

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color based on the problem description. The formula used is appropriate for the given constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
