#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: `[*open(0)][1:]` is exhausted, and all elements in the list `[*open(0)][1:]` have been processed. For each processed element `s`, `n` and `k` were assigned the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by whitespace, respectively, and the corresponding calculation was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, skipping the first line. For each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and prints a calculated value based on these integers. The calculation is as follows: if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the function prints `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, otherwise, it prints `2 * n` plus 1 if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input source is exhausted, and the calculations for all lines have been printed.
