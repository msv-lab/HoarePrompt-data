Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. Here's a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3 9
```

Expected Output:
```
5
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
6
```

The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of cells to color for the case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \). The correct minimum number of cells to color is 5, not 6. This is because you can color the cells in such a way that all 9 diagonals have at least one colored cell with only 5 cells colored. For example, you can color the cells at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,2) to achieve this.
