To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `a` and `ans_list`.

1. **`a`**: This variable will be assigned the value of each element in `ans_list` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `a` does not need to be explicitly set because it will be assigned by the loop.
2. **`ans_list`**: For the loop to execute, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. If `ans_list` is empty, the loop will not run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `ans_list` is not empty and contains at least one element. The variable `a` will be assigned the first element of `ans_list` at the start of the loop.

State: **`ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case and must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `ans_list`**
