Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `res` is `n - 3` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 4`, `k` is `k - dif * 3`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, `k` is now `k - dif * 3`.
- The values of `ans_list`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `dif` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `dif` to its current value.
- The value of `res` is determined based on the value of `dif`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 4`.
