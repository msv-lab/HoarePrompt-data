Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `dif` is not 0, `res` remains `n - 1`, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
