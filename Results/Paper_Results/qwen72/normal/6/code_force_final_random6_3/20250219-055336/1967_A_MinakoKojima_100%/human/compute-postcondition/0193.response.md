Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `0 - dif * 3`, `res` is `n - 4 + k % 2`, and `ans` is `a[0] + dif`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2 + k % 3`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 3 (integer division), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
