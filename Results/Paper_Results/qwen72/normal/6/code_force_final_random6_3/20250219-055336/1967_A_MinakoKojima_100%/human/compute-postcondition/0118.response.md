Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `k` is decreased by `dif * 3`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.
- `dif` is still equal to `a[3] - a[2]`.
- `ans` is still increased by `dif`.
- If `dif` is 0, `res` is still decreased by 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
- `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and since `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `dif * 3`.
