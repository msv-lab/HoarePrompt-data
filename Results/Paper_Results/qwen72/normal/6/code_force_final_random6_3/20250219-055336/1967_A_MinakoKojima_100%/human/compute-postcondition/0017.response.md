Postcondition: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer provided by the user input where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, so `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.**
