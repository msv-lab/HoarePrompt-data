Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. If `k` is not 0, `res` is increased by 0 % `n`.***
