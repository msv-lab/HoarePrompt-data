Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The length of `a` is `n`, and each element `a_i` in `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The other variables remain unchanged.
