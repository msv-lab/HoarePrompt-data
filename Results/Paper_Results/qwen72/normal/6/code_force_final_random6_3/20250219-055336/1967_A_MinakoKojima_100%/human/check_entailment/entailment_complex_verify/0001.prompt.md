You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each test case. Each test case involves the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list `a` of integers representing the number of cards of each type. The function calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be bought with `k` coins for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results to the console. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of distinct types of cards and `k` is the number of coins (which can be used to buy new cards).
   - It then reads a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of cards of each type.

2. **Sorting the Initial Card Counts:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to handle the smallest counts first, which is essential for maximizing the score.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to the smallest count in the sorted list `a[0]`. This is because the smallest count will determine the initial number of complete subarrays of length `n` that can be formed.
   - The variable `res` is initialized to `n - 1`, which represents the number of gaps between the smallest count and the next smallest counts.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted List:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` from the second element to the last.
   - For each element, it calculates the difference `dif` between the current element and the previous element.
   - If `dif` is zero, it means the current count is the same as the previous count, so it decrements `res` to account for the gap.
   - If `dif` is not zero, it checks if `k` (the remaining coins) is sufficient to make the current count equal to the next count.
     - If `k` is sufficient, it updates `ans` by adding `dif` and decrements `k` by `dif * (i + 1)`.
     - It also decrements `res` to account for the gap.
     - If `k` is not sufficient, it updates `ans` by adding the maximum possible number of cards that can be bought with the remaining `k` coins, and it updates `res` accordingly.
     - It then sets `k` to zero and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Coins:**
   - If there are still coins left after the loop, it updates `ans` by adding the maximum number of complete subarrays that can be formed with the remaining coins, and it updates `res` to account for any leftover coins.

6. **Calculating the Final Score:**
   - The final score is calculated as `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.
   - This formula accounts for the number of complete subarrays of length `n` that can be formed, plus the number of gaps that can be filled to form additional subarrays.

7. **Output:**
   - The program appends the final score to a list `ans_list`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each score in the list.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Sorting the List:** Sorting the list `a` is a valid approach because it allows the program to handle the smallest counts first, which is necessary for maximizing the score.
- **Gap Handling:** The program correctly handles the gaps between the smallest count and the next smallest counts by using the coins to fill these gaps.
- **Remaining Coins:** The program correctly handles the remaining coins by adding the maximum possible number of complete subarrays that can be formed with the remaining coins.
- **Final Score Calculation:** The final score calculation is correct and follows the logic of forming the maximum number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the reasoning steps. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
