Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is now `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` and `k` are input integers.** 

The list `a` has been updated to contain the integers provided by the user. The values of `ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is still the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1.
