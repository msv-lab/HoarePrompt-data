You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include them. For the problem to be solved, the function should accept parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` and `k` (integers for each test case representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins), and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers representing the number of cards of each type. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = a[0]
        
        res = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        
        ans += res
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
        
    #State: `ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)
        
    #State: `ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case, and all elements in `ans_list` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the maximum number of cards that can be bought with `k` coins, given the number of distinct types of cards `n` and the number of cards of each type `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
