The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment with each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer provided by the user input where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is 0**
