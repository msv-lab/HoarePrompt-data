Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3` and `ans` is 0. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is `n - 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * 3`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is `n - 5`, and `k` is reduced by `dif * 3`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * 3`, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is set to `k // 3`, and `res` remains as `n - 4 + k % 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
