Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is now equal to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `ans_list` now contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `res` is now equal to `n - 1`, `i` is 0, the difference between the first two elements of `a` (`dif`) is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. Additionally, `i` is not 0.**

Note: The postcondition includes all the conditions from the precondition and adds the condition that `i` is not 0, as specified by the if condition. However, since `i` is initially 0, the if condition will not be true, and the postcondition reflects the state of the program if it were to enter the if condition. In this case, the postcondition is not possible because `i` cannot be both 0 and not 0 simultaneously.
