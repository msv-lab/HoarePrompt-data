Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than 0, `k` is updated to `k - dif` and `res` is `n - 3`.***
