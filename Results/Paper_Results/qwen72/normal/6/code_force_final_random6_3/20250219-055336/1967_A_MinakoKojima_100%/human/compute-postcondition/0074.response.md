Output State: **`a` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0]`, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res` is no longer the value of `ans`.**

Explanation:
- `res` is now assigned the value `n - 1`.
- The initial state of `a`, `ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged.
- The condition that `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res` is no longer the value of `ans` is still valid.
