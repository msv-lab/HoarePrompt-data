Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is now equal to `a[0]`, `ans_list` now contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `res` is now equal to `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the first two elements of `a`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `res` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is set to `a[0] + dif`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is set to `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` remains `a[0]`, `k` is set to 0, and `res` remains `n - 1`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` remains `a[0]`, `k` remains the second integer from the input, and `res` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 2 + k % 2`. If `dif` is not 0, the function may break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * 2`, and `res` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 1 + k % 2` or `n - 2 + k % 2` depending on the initial condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `dif` is the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `k` is set to 0, `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2 + k % 3`, and `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 3 (integer division). If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * 2`, and `res` is `n - 3` or `n - 4` depending on the initial condition. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 2 + k % 2` or `n - 3 + k % 2` depending on the initial condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
