Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include them. For the problem to be solved, the function should accept parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` and `k` (integers for each test case representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins), and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers representing the number of cards of each type. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
