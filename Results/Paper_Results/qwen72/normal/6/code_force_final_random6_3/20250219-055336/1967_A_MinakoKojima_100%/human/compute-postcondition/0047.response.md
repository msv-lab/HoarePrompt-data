The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is either `n - 2` if `dif` is 0, or `n - 3` if `dif` is not 0. Therefore, the new value of `res` is `n - 3` if `dif` is 0, or `n - 4` if `dif` is not 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 4`.**
