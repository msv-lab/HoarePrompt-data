Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `dif` is the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `k` is set to 0, `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2 + k % 3`, and `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 3 (integer division). If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * 2`, and `res` is `n - 3` or `n - 4` depending on the initial condition. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 2 + k % 2` or `n - 3 + k % 2` depending on the initial condition.***
