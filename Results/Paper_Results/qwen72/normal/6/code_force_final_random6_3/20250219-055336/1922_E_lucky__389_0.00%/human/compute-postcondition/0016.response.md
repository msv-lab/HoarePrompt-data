Output State: **`subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i`, `x` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i <= x + 1, `x` must be at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

The value `i` has been appended to the list `subseq_lens`, which was initially empty. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
