Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences subtracted from `x` during the loop, and `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences.**

### Explanation:
- **`x` is 0**: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not zero. Each iteration of the loop reduces `x` by \(2^i - 1\), where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\). Eventually, `x` will be reduced to 0, and the loop will terminate.
- **`subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences subtracted from `x` during the loop**: Each time the loop runs, it appends the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`. This list will contain all the values of `i` that were used to reduce `x` during the loop.
- **`mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences**: The variable `mx` is updated to the maximum value of `i` encountered during the loop. This means that `mx` will hold the largest integer `i` that was used to reduce `x` by \(2^i - 1\) during the loop.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the lengths of the sub-sequences subtracted from `x`, and `mx` will be the maximum of these lengths.
