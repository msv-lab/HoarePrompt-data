Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements.
   - `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences.
   - `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 1` elements.
   - `i` is `len(subseq_lens)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(ansv[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is set to `len(subseq_lens)`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the `subseq_lens` list plus one.
   - Since `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 1` elements, `ansv[i]` is a valid index.
   - The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The exact value of `ansv[i]` is not specified in the initial state, but we know it is the element at the index `len(subseq_lens)` in the list `ansv`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **ansv[len(subseq_lens)] (where ansv[len(subseq_lens)] is the element at index len(subseq_lens) in the list ansv)**
