Output State: **`The function should accept an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. `i` is 0.****

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `i` is now set to 0. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
