Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it does not accept any parameters. This is incorrect because the function should take the integer `X` as an input for each test case.
   - The function should be defined as `def func_1(x):` and called as `func_1(x)` within the loop.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The function subtracts 1 from `x` and then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1`. This is done to decompose `x` into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1.
   - The lengths of these sub-sequences are stored in `subseq_lens`, and `mx` is updated to the maximum length found.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 0, which means all the required subsequences have been accounted for.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - Then, it appends the elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1.
   - The length of `ansv` is printed, followed by the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The length of `ansv` is `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`, which is within the allowed range of 200.
   - The elements of `ansv` are within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is 0 by breaking the loop.
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is 1, which should be a valid input. However, the problem description specifies `2 \le X \le 10^{18}`, so this is not a concern.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly decomposes `x` into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1, which is a valid approach to generate the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The construction of `ansv` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x + 1`, which matches the input `X`.

7. **Final Output**:
   - The final output correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself, which is in the required format.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct and meets the problem requirements. However, the function definition and input handling need to be corrected to accept the integer `X` for each test case.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the function definition and input handling issues. The function should accept `X` as a parameter and be called with the correct input for each test case.
