You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= q <= 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It then checks the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `q` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description, which specifies that the first line of input contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, which is correct as it processes each test case individually.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct because the problem description states that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.

4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description, which defines a stair as `a < b < c`.

5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description, which defines a peak as `a < b > c`.

6. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because the problem description specifies that if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, the output should be "NONE".

7. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions as specified, and outputs the correct results, it appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
