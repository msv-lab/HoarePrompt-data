The `print('NONE')` statement will print the string 'NONE' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or the conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides conditions for the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the print statement itself does not depend on these conditions. It simply prints the string 'NONE'.

Output: **NONE**
