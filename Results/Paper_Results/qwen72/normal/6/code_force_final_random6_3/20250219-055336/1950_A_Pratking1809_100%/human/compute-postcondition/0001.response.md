The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `q-1`.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
