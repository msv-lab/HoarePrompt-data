The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns the results for each test case based on the provided digits.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), and the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). It returns the results for each test case based on the provided digits.**
