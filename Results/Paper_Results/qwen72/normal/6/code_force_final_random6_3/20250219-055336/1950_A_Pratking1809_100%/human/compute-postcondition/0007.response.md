Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- Additionally, `a < b` and `b > c`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('PEAK')` will simply print the string `'PEAK'`.

The conditions `a < b` and `b > c` indicate that `b` is a peak value, meaning it is greater than both `a` and `c`. The other conditions (`q > 0`, `i = 0`, and the fact that `a < b < c` is not true) do not affect the print statement directly.

Output: **PEAK**
