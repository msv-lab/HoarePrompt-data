Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b` and `b > c` holds.
- Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
