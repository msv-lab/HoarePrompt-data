Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `q` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
4. It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
5. It is not the case that `a < b > c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NONE'`.

### Explanation:
- The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are not satisfied, but this does not influence the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NONE**
