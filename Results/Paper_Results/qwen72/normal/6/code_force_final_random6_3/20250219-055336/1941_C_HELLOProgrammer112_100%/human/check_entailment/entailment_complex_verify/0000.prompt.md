You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `int(input())` has been fully consumed, `_` is equal to `int(input())` - 1, `a` is the last input integer greater than 0, `s` is the last input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the last `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the last `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the number of times the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' appear in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the input stream is fully consumed, and the final printed results correspond to the calculations for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and their combined form "mapie", but it does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to ensure the string does not contain these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", and 0 occurrences of "mapie". It will output 1 (1 + 1 - 0), but the correct output should be 2, as removing the 'p' and 'i' characters at positions 2 and 3 (0-based index) will make the string "mae" which is beautiful.

Another example is the string "mappppie". The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", and 0 occurrences of "mapie". It will output 1 (1 + 1 - 0), but the correct output should be 2, as removing the 'p' and 'i' characters at positions 3 and 4 (0-based index) will make the string "mappe" which is beautiful.

These examples show that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful.
