Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, and `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.
- The code snippet `a = int(input())` reassigns `a` to a new input integer.
- Since the initial state already specifies that `a` is an input integer greater than 0, the new value of `a` must also be an input integer greater than 0.
- The values of `_`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `a` has been reassigned to a new input integer greater than 0.
