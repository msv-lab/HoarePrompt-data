Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the counts of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then outputs the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie". However, this approach does not account for the overlapping occurrences of these substrings or the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and determine the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither substring appears in the final string. This involves more complex logic than simply counting the substrings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the number of deletions required
        deletions = 0
        
        # Use a pointer to traverse the string
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if s[i:i+3] == "map":
                deletions += 3
                i += 3
            elif s[i:i+3] == "pie":
                deletions += 3
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        
        # Output the number of deletions
        print(deletions)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies and removes the substrings "map" and "pie" by incrementing the pointer `i` by 3 whenever one of these substrings is found, and it counts the number of deletions required. If neither substring is found, it simply moves the pointer to the next character. This ensures that the minimum number of deletions is calculated to make the string beautiful.
