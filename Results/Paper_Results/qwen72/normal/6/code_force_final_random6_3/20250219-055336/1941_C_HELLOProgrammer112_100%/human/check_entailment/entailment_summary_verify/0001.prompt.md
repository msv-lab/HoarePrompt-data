You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the number of times the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' appear in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the input stream is fully consumed, and the final printed results correspond to the calculations for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string `s`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie".

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The logic `x + y - z` is intended to account for the overlapping occurrences of "mapie" in the string. However, this logic is flawed because:
     - The count of "mapie" is not relevant to the problem. We need to focus on the substrings "pie" and "map".
     - The counts of "map" and "pie" are not sufficient to determine the minimum number of deletions required. For example, if "pie" and "map" overlap, simply subtracting the count of "mapie" does not correctly account for the deletions needed.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
     - Identify all occurrences of "pie" and "map" in the string.
     - Ensure that we do not double-count overlapping substrings.
     - Calculate the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input "mmapnapie":
     - "map" occurs once.
     - "pie" occurs once.
     - The program outputs `2` (1 + 1 - 0), which is correct.
   - For the input "azabazapi":
     - "map" does not occur.
     - "pie" does not occur.
     - The program outputs `0`, which is correct.
   - For the input "mappppie":
     - "map" occurs once.
     - "pie" occurs once.
     - The program outputs `2` (1 + 1 - 0), which is correct.
   - For the input "mapmapmapmapmapmap":
     - "map" occurs 6 times.
     - "pie" does not occur.
     - The program outputs `6` (6 + 0 - 0), which is correct.
   - For the input "p":
     - "map" does not occur.
     - "pie" does not occur.
     - The program outputs `0`, which is correct.
   - For the input "pppiepieeee":
     - "map" does not occur.
     - "pie" occurs twice.
     - The program outputs `2` (0 + 2 - 0), which is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the program producing correct outputs for the given examples, the logic is flawed and does not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, if the string contains overlapping "pie" and "map" substrings, the program will not correctly calculate the minimum deletions.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle overlapping substrings and does not provide a general solution for all cases.
