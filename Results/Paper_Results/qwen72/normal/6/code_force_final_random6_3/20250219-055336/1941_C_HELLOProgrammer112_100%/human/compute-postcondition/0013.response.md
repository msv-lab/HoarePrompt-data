Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1. This input is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.
   - `_` is 1. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can also ignore it.
   - `a` is an input integer greater than 0. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
   - `s` is a new input string. This string is provided by the user and will be used in the code snippet.
   - `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.
   - `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x + y - z)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(x + y - z)` statement will print the result of the expression `x + y - z`.
   - `x` is the count of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
   - `y` is the count of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
   - `z` is the count of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `s` contains the substring 'mapie', it will be counted in both `x` and `y` because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie'. However, it will also be counted in `z`.
   - The expression `x + y - z` will effectively count the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in `s` but subtract the overlap where 'mapie' is counted twice (once in `x` and once in `y`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in `s` minus the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`)**
