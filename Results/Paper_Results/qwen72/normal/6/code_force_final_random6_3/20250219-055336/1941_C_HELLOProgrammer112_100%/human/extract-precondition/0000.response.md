Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

This function will process `t` test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, s)`, and `s` is a string of length `n`.
