Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `hd` (which is initially `a1 - a2`) is greater than 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and is guaranteed to be greater than -1. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration. If `hd` is not greater than 0, `hd` remains `a1 - a2`.***
