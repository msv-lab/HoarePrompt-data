Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the first `hd` positions, and `hd` is `a1 - a2 - min(hd, n)`**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, which remains valid after the code execution.
- All other variables (`t`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, `res`, and `hd`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their values and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
