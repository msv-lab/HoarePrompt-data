Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0', `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1, and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `a1 - a2` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. If the first character of `s1` is not '1' or the first character of `s2` is not '0', `res` remains the absolute value of `a1 - a2` and `hd` remains `a1 - a2`.***
