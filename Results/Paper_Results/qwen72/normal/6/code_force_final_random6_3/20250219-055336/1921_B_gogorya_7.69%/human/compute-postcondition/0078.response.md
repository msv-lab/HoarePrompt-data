The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `a1 - a2` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`.**
