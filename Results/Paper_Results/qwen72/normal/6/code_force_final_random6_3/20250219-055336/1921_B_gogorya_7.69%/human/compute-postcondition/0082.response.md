Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1, and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `a1 - a2` is greater than 0 and `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 + 1` if `hd` > 0, or `hd` remains `a1 - a2` (or `a1 - a2 - 1` if the first character of `s1` is '1' and the first character of `s2` is '0' and `a1 - a2` was greater than 0 and `hd` <= 0). If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', `res` and `hd` remain unchanged.***
