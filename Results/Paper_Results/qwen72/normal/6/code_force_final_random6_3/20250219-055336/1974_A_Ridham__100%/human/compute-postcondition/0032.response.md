Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is the same as in the initial state, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `remaining_cells` using the expression `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `screen_require_for_y`) retain their initial values or conditions.
- The value of `remaining_cells` is now calculated based on the existing values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`.
