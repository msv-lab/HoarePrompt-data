Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons for each test case. It handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, ensuring that the 2x2 icons are placed first, and then the remaining space is used to place the 1x1 icons. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is sound and covers all edge cases, including when there are no icons, when there are only 1x1 icons, and when there are only 2x2 icons. The program also correctly handles the case where the remaining space for 1x1 icons is not a multiple of 15, ensuring that an additional screen is added if necessary. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
