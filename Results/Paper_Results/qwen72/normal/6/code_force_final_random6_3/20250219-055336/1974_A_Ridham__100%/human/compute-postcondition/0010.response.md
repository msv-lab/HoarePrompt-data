Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` calculates the number of screens required for `y` based on the integer division of `y` by 2 and then adding 1.
- Since `y` is an odd integer, `y // 2` will result in an integer that is the largest integer less than or equal to `y / 2`.
- Adding 1 to this result gives the value of `screen_require_for_y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
