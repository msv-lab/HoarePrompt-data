Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`.**

The value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2`, which means it is the integer division of `y` by 2. Since `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` will be an integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
