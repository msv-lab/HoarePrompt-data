Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list containing a single element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15` is 0, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` and `extra_space % 15` is not equal to 0.**
