Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is the same as in the initial state, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that now includes `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `(x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1`, and `result` is a list that now includes the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.***
