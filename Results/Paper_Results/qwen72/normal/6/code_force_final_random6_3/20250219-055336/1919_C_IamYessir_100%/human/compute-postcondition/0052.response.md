The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The initial state does not provide information about the list `b`, so we cannot determine the specific value of `y`. However, the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
