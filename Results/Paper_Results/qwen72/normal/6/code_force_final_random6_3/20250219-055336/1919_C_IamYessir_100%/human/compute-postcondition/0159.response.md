Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`. If the condition is not met, the lists and variables remain unchanged.**
