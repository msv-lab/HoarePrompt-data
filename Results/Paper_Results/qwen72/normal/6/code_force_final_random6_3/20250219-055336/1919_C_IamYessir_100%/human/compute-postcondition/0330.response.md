Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is 0, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by `n`. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.** 

The variable `s` is now set to 0, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
