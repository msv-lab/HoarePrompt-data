Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. In all other cases, `x` and `y` retain their original values, with `x` being greater than `y` and `y` being less than `lit[i]`.**
