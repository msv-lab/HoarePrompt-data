Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a list with the second element of `lit` appended to it, if `len(a) == 0` then `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`, if `len(b) == 0` then `y` is infinity, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.** 

In natural language: The value of `_` remains 0, `n` is still an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` remains 0, and `i` remains 1. The list `b` now includes the second element of `lit` appended to it. The value of `x` is still determined by whether the list `a` is empty (infinity if empty, otherwise the last element of `lit`). The value of `y` is now determined by whether the list `b` is empty (infinity if empty, otherwise the last element of `b`, which is the second element of `lit`).
