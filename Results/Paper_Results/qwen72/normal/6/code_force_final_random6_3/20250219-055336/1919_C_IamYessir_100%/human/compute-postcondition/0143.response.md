Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `b` is empty, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is infinity. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, and `x` is updated to the value of `lit[0]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
