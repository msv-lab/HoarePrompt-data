Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` and `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `len(b) > 0`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[2]`, `b` now contains the integer from `lit` at index 2, and `y` is updated to this value. If `x > y` and `y < lit[2]`, and `lit[2] > x`, `b` now includes the integer at index 2 of `lit` as its last element, and `y` is updated to this value. If `x > y` and `lit[2] <= x` and `lit[2] > y`, the list `a` now includes the integer at index 2 of `lit` as its last element. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, no further changes are made. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[2]`, `a` includes the `i`-th element of `lit` as its last element. If `lit[2] > y`, the last element of `a` is now `lit[2]`. If `lit[2] <= y` and `lit[2] > x`, `b` now contains the integer from `lit` at index 2 as its last element. If `len(b) == 1`, `y` is set to the integer from `lit` at index 2.***
