Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. The list `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the end of the list `a`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1`, and since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, the condition `n > i + 1` still holds true.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The list `lit` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code.
- The value of `y` is not affected by the code, so it retains its original value. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.
- The value of `x` is not affected by the code, so it retains its original value. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
- The list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` as its last element.
