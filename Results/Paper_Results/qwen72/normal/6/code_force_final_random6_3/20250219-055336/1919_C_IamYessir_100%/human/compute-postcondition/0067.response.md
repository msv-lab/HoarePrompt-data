Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x < y`, and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. If `lit[i] > y`, `a` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`. If `x >= y`, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
