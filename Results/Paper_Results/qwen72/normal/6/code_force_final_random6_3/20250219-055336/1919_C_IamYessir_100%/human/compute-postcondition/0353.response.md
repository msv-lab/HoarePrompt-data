To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`a`**: A list with at least 2 elements.
2. **`b`**: A list that must have at least `n` elements.
3. **`i`**: `len(b) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `b`.
4. **`s`**: The number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (excluding the first element of `b`).
5. **`n`**: An input integer.
6. **`cp`**: An integer.
7. **`_`**: An integer, which is incremented by `n`.
8. **`x`**: The last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`.
9. **`y`**: The last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is defined as the sum of two counts:
- The number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element.
- The number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, excluding the first element of `b`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe `s` based on the given conditions.

Output: **s (where s is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, excluding the first element of `b`)**
