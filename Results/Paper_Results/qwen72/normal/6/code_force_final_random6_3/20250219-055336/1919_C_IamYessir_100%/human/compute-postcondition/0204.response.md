Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. `b` now contains the integer from `lit` at index 2 as its last element. If `len(b) == 1`, `y` is set to the integer from `lit` at index 2. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.**
