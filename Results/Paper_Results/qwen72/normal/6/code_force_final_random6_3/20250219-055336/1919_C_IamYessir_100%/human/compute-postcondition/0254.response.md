Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 1, `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]`. `b` now contains `lit[i]`.**
