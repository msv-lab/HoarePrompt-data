Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value `lit[i]` to the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is incremented by 1, so `lit[i]` refers to the next element in the `lit` list.
- The values of `a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise.
- The value of `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`, which updates the state of `a` but does not affect the other variables or conditions.
