Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of `lit` is 0, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with the last element equal to `lit[2]`. Otherwise, if `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[2]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list containing `lit[2]`. If none of these conditions are met, `a` remains unchanged.**
