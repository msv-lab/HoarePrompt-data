Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are equal.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the first element of `lit` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is the first element of `lit`.
- The value of `x` is updated to the last element of `a`, which is now the first element of `lit`.
- The value of `y` remains the last element of `b` (which is still infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is non-empty).
- The condition `x` is less than or equal to `y` and the current values of `x` and `y` are equal remains valid.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
