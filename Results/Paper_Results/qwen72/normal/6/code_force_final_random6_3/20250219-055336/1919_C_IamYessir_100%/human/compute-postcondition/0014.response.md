Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `b` is a non-empty list, so `y` is now the last element of `b`.
- The condition for `x` is still valid and remains unchanged: if `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.
