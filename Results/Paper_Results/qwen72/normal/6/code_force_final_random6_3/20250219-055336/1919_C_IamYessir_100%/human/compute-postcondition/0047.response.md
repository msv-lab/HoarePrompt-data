The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1**
