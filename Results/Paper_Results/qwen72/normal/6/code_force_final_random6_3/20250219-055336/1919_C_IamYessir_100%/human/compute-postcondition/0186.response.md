Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x == y`, `x` is set to `lit[1]` and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[1]`, `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `lit[1] > y` and `x < lit[1]`, `x` is set to `lit[1]`. Otherwise, if `y >= lit[1]` and `lit[1] > x`, `lit[1]` is appended to the list `b`.***
