Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their original values, with `x` being greater than `y` and `y` being less than `lit[i]`.**
