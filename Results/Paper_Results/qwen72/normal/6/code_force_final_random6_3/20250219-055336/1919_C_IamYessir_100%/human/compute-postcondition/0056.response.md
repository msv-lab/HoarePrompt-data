Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` has the second element of `lit` appended to it. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the second element of `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `a`.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `b`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for setting `x` and `y` are still valid, but `a` now has one more element, which is the second element of `lit`.
