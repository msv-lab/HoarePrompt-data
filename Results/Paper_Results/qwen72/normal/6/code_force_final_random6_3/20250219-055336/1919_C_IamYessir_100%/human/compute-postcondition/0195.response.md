Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. `b` now contains the integer from `lit` at index 2, `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `len(a) > 0` otherwise `x` is infinity, `y` is set to the last element of `b` which is now the integer from `lit` at index 2 if `len(b) > 0` otherwise `y` is infinity.**
