Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 0, and `word` is a string. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` contains the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is less than or equal to 52, `word` is either 'aay' if `n` is 27, 'aa' concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` in the string `alphabet` if `n` is within the range 3 to 26, or 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z' if `n` is greater than 27.***
