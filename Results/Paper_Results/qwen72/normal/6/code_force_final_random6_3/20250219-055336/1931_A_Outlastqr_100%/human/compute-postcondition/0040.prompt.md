Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 0, and `word` is a string. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` contains the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is less than or equal to 52, `word` is either 'aay' if `n` is 27, 'aa' concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` in the string `alphabet` if `n` is within the range 3 to 26, or 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z' if `n` is greater than 27.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 1, and `word` is either a string containing the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz' if `n` > 52, or 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z' if `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, or 'aay' if `n` is 27, or 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet if `n` is between 3 and 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 2. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string corresponding to the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is a string containing 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, followed by 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
