Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 1, and `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.**

Explanation: The code concatenates the character 'a', the character at the index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, and the character 'z' to form the new value of `word`. The value of `n` remains within the range 3 to 78, and `i` remains 1. The new value of `word` is a string that starts with 'a', followed by the character at the index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, and ends with 'z'.
