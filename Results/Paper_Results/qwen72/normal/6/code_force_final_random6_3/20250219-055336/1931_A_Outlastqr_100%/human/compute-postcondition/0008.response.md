Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `n` is greater than 27, `n` is less than or equal to 52, `i` is 0, `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'**

Explanation: The value of `word` is updated to the string formed by concatenating 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and 'z'. The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `word` will depend on the value of `n`, but it will always be a string starting with 'a', followed by a character from the `alphabet` string, and ending with 'z'.
