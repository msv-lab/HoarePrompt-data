You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the final value of `i` is `input() - 1`. For each iteration, `n` was an input integer within the range 3 to 78, and `word` was printed based on the following rules: If `n` > 52, `word` contained the character from the `alphabet` string at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` contained 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, followed by 'z'. If `n` was 27, `word` was 'aay'. If `n` was between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` was 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded sum of the positions of the three-letter word.

2. **Alphabet Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Word Construction:**
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest word based on the value of `n`:
     - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
       - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` to the beginning, followed by 'zz'.
       - This is correct because the maximum sum of the positions of a three-letter word is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and the smallest word that can have a sum greater than 52 is 'azz' (1 + 26 + 26 = 53).
     - **Case 2: `n > 27`**
       - If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, the program constructs the word by adding 'a' to the beginning, the letter corresponding to `n - 28` to the middle, and 'z' to the end.
       - This is correct because the smallest word that can have a sum greater than 27 is 'aaz' (1 + 1 + 26 = 28).
     - **Case 3: `n == 27`**
       - If `n` is exactly 27, the program constructs the word 'aay'.
       - This is correct because 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25 = 27) is the lexicographically smallest word with a sum of 27.
     - **Case 4: `n <= 27`**
       - If `n` is less than or equal to 27, the program constructs the word by adding 'aa' to the beginning and the letter corresponding to `n - 3` to the end.
       - This is correct because the smallest word with a sum of `n` can be constructed by using 'aa' and the appropriate letter to make the sum `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded sum `n`. The logic and conditions used are accurate and cover all possible scenarios within the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
