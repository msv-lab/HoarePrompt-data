Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Large Values**:
   - The program assumes that if `n > 52`, the word should be formed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is incorrect because it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, if `n = 70`, the correct output should be `rzz`, but if `n = 71`, the correct output should be `szz`, not `rzz`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Values Between 27 and 52**:
   - The program assumes that if `n > 27`, the word should be formed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is also incorrect.
   - For example, if `n = 55`, the correct output should be `czz`, but the program outputs `aaz`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Values Less Than or Equal to 27**:
   - The program assumes that if `n == 27`, the word should be `'aay'`. This is correct for `n = 27`, but it does not handle other values correctly.
   - For example, if `n = 24`, the correct output should be `aav`, but the program outputs `aax`.

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to distribute the sum `n` among the three letters in such a way that the first letter is as small as possible, followed by the second, and then the third. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_smallest_word(n):
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    word = []
    for i in range(3):
        if n > 26:
            word.append('z')
            n -= 26
        else:
            word.append(alphabet[n - 1])
            n = 0
    return ''.join(word)

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(find_smallest_word(n))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Distribute the Sum**:
   - We start with an empty list `word` to store the letters.
   - We iterate 3 times (once for each letter in the word).
   - If `n` is greater than 26, we append 'z' to the word and subtract 26 from `n`.
   - If `n` is 26 or less, we append the corresponding letter from the alphabet and set `n` to 0.

2. **Join the Letters**:
   - After distributing the sum, we join the list `word` into a string and print it.

This approach ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest by always trying to use the smallest possible letters first.
