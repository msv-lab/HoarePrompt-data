The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

So, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0 (the starting point of the loop).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
