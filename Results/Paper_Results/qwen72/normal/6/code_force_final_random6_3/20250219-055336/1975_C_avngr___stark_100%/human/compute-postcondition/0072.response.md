Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `max` is either the second element of `temp` if `temp[1]` is greater than the initial value of `max`, or remains the same as the initial value of `max`, `temp` is a sorted list of the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`.**

The code `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. The elements of `temp` are the same as before, but now they are sorted. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `max` is still either the second element of `temp` if `temp[1]` is greater than the initial value of `max`, or remains the same as the initial value of `max`.
