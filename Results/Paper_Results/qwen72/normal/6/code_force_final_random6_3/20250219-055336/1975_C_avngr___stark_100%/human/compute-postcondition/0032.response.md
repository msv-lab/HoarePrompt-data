Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]`. If `n` is 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
