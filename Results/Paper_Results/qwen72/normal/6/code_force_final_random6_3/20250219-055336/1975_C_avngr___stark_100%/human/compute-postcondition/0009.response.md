The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the expression `n - 2`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value, meaning `n - 2` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default starting value for the `range` function.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `max`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `max` is 0, `i` is 0**
