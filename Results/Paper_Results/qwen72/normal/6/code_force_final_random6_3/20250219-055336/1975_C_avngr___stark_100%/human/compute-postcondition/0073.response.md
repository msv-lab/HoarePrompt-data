Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `max` is the second element of `temp`, `temp` is a sorted list of the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max` is updated to be the second element of the sorted list `temp`.
- The initial state of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remains unchanged.
- `temp` is still a sorted list of the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`.
- The previous value of `max` is no longer relevant as it is now explicitly set to `temp[1]`.
