Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\).**

Explanation: The variable `x` is calculated using the expression \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1\), which further simplifies to \((a - 0) // 1 + 1\), and finally to \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\). Since the integer division of `a - 1` by 1 is `a - 1`, the value of `x` becomes \((a - 1) + 1\), which simplifies to `a`. Therefore, `x` is equal to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
