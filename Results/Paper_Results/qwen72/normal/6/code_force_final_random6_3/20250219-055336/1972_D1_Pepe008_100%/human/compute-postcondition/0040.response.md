Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1\), `suma` remains 0 if \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1 \leq 0\), otherwise `suma` is `a + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is calculated using the expression \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\), where `i` is 1.
- Substituting `i` with 1, the expression becomes \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 0) // 1 + 1\), and further simplifies to `a + 1`.
- If `a + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is set to `a + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
