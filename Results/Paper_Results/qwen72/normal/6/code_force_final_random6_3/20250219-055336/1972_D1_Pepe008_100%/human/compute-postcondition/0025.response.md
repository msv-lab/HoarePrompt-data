Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b`, and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- The variable `T` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `t` remains 0.
- The variable `a` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the first string in `info`.
- The variable `b` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second string in `info`.
- The variable `suma` is updated to the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop. For each iteration \(i\) from 1 to `b`:
  - `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\).
  - If this `x` value is greater than 0, it is added to `suma`.
  - Additionally, if both \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) are true, an extra 1 is added to `suma`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
