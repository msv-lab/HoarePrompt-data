The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` being less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, and `T` must still be greater than `t`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the sum of the values of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\)**
