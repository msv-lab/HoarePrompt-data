The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine what the function returns. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The return value is not specified.**
