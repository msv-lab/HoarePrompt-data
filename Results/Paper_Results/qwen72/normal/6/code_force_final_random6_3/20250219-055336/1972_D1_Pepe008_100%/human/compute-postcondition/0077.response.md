Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the specified range.
- `T` remains greater than 1, and `t` remains 2.
- `info` remains the list of strings from the input.
- `a` and `b` retain their values as the integer values of the first and second strings in `info`, respectively.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `b` after all iterations.
- `suma` will be the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`. Additionally, `suma` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 1 to `b` if both \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) are true.
