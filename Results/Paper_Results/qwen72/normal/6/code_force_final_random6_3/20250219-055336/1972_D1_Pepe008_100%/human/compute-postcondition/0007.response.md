Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is 0, and `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Additionally, the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)` is greater than 0.**
