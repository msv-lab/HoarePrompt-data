Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than 0, `suma` is 0, `x` is \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\), and the expression \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is greater than 0.**
