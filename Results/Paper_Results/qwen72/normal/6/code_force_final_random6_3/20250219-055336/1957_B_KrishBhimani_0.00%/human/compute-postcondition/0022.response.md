Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the number of bits in the original `k`. `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains the first integer from `l1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be 0 because the loop continues to right-shift `k` until it becomes 0.
- **`k0`**: Remains the second integer from `l1` as it is not modified within the loop. However, it must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k` to ensure the loop runs at least that many times.
- **`l1`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`int(input())`**: Must still be greater than 0, as it is a precondition and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of bits in the original `k` (i.e., the number of times the loop has run).
- **`arr`**: Contains the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1. For example, if `k` was 13 (binary 1101), `arr` will be `[0, 2, 3]` because the 0th, 2nd, and 3rd bits are set to 1.
