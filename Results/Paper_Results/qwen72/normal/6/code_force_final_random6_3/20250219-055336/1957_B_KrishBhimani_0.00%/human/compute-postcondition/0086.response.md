Output State: **`i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least 3 elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, and `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i` and `k0 - sum(ans)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is the third element in `arr`.
- The value of `n` is the first integer from `l1`.
- The value of `k` is 0.
- The value of `k0` is the second integer from `l1`.
- The value of `c` is 2.
- The list `ans` initially contains the value `1 << i`.
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- The sum of `ans` before appending is `1 << i`.
- Therefore, the new value appended to `ans` is `k0 - (1 << i)`.
- The final state of `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` and `k0 - (1 << i)`.
