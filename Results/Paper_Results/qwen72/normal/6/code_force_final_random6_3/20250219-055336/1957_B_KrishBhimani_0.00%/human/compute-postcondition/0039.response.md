Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `c` is 2, `ans` now contains the element `1 << i` and `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- `k0` is the second integer from `l1`.
- `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the elements currently in `ans`, which includes the element `1 << i` that was previously appended.
- The new element appended to `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `l1`, `int(input())`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.
