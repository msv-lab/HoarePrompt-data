Output State: **`i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0 - 0`, `c` is 0, and `c` is equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - 0` to the list `ans` because `ans` was initially empty, so `sum(ans)` is 0.
- The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
