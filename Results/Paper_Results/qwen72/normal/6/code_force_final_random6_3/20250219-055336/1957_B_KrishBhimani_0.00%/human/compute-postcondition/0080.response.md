Output State: **`i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1 << i, k0 - sum(ans)]`, `c` is 1**

Explanation:
- `ans` initially contains the value `1 << i`.
- `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the current elements in `ans`, which is `1 << i`.
- `k0 - sum(ans)` computes the value of `k0` minus the sum of the elements in `ans`.
- The result of `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`.
- The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
