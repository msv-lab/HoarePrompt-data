The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given that `i` is 2, the value 2 will be appended to `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is either `[1]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the original `k` was odd or even. Therefore, the updated `arr` will be `[1, 2]` if the original `k` was odd, or `[0, 1, 2]` if the original `k` was even. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than 3, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is `[1, 2]` if the original `k` was odd, or `[0, 1, 2]` if the original `k` was even.**
