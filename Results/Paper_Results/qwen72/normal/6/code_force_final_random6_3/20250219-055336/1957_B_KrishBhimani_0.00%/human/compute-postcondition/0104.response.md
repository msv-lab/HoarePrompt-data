Output State: **`arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` depending on whether `k0` was odd, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is `k0` right-shifted by 1 bit, `i` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.** 

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by performing a right bit shift operation (`k = k >> 1`). This means that `k` is now equal to `k0` divided by 2 (integer division). The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `arr` depends on whether `k0` was odd or even, and this state remains the same after the code execution.
