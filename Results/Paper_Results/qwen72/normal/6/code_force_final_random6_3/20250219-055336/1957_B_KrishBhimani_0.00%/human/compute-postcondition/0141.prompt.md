Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1, `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append, `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1`, and if `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. `ans` is extended by appending zeros until its length equals `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing elements where each element is `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`. If `c` is `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. The length of `ans` is now `n`, with the additional elements being 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
