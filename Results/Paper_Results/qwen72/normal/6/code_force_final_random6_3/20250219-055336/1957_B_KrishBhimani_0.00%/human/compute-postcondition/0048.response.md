Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1, `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append, `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1 = input().split()` updates `l1` to be a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- The initial state already specifies that `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, so this part remains unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, and `c` are not affected by the code snippet provided.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the reassignment of `l1` to the split input.
