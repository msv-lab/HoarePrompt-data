Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 1 bit and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[1]` if the original `k` was odd, otherwise `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.**
