The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and `arr` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the second element in `arr`, and `arr` must contain at least two elements.

State: **`i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`, `c` is 1**
