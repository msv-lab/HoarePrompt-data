Output State: **`arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` if `k` was an odd number before the shift. `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` shifted right by 1 bit, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append. `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`. `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `i` is 0. If `k` was an odd number before the shift, `arr` contains `[0]` and `ans` is updated accordingly.**
