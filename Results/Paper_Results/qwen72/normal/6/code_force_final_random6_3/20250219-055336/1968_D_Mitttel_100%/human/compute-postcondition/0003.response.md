Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element of `p` is a distinct integer from 1 to `n`, and each element of `a` is an integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ `n`. `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes a new list `vis` with `n` elements, all set to 0.
- The values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- `vis` is now a list of `n` zeros, indicating that no elements have been visited yet.
