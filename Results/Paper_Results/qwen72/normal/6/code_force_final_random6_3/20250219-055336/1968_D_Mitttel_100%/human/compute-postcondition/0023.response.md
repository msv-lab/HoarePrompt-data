Output State: **The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), and `a[s]` is the element of the list `a` at the position `s` where the loop terminates.**
