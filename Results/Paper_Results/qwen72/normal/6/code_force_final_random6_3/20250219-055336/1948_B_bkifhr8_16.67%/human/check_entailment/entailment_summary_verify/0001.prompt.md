You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in ascending order. If `lst` is not sorted in ascending order, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the correct positions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly returns `True` if the array is sorted and `False` otherwise.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Operation Simulation:**
  - The program only performs the operation once for the first pair of elements that meet the conditions. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied multiple times to different elements in the array.
  - For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. It does not consider further operations on `45` or `67`.

- **Incorrect Insertion:**
  - The program inserts the digits in the wrong positions. When an element is split, the digits should replace the original element, not be inserted separately.
  - For example, splitting `12` should result in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, not `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` with `1` and `2` inserted separately.

- **No Recursion or Loop for Multiple Operations:**
  - The program does not handle the case where multiple operations are needed to sort the array. It should continue applying the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct for all test cases. It fails to handle multiple operations and incorrect insertion of digits.

Correctness: **False**
