Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only attempts to split one element at a time and does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or splitting elements in a way that ensures the array can be sorted. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

The program fails in the second test case. Here's why:

- For the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will only split the first element `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. After this, the array is still not sorted, and the program will print `No`.
- However, if we split `28` into `[2, 8]`, the array becomes `[12, 2, 8, 5]`. Then, if we split `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which can be sorted to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`. Therefore, the correct output should be `Yes`.

The program does not account for the possibility of splitting multiple elements or ensuring that the array can be sorted after splitting. Hence, it is incorrect.
