### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the correct positions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly returns `True` if the array is sorted and `False` otherwise.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Operation Simulation:**
  - The program only performs the operation once for the first pair of elements that meet the conditions. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied multiple times to different elements in the array.
  - For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. It does not consider further operations on `45` or `67`.

- **Incorrect Insertion:**
  - The program inserts the digits in the wrong positions. When an element is split, the digits should replace the original element, not be inserted separately.
  - For example, splitting `12` should result in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, not `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` with `1` and `2` inserted separately.

- **No Recursion or Loop for Multiple Operations:**
  - The program does not handle the case where multiple operations are needed to sort the array. It should continue applying the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct for all test cases. It fails to handle multiple operations and incorrect insertion of digits.

Correctness: **False**
