### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it is possible to transform an array into a non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order and greater than 10.
   - If such an element is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing the array, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `func_1` returns `True` if the array is sorted and `False` otherwise.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Single Pass Issue:** The program only performs one pass through the array to check and split elements. This is insufficient because splitting an element can create new elements that need to be checked in subsequent positions. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After the first pass, it becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but the program does not check if `45` needs to be split further.
   - **Insertion Position:** The program inserts the digits in the correct position, but it does not handle the case where the array needs to be checked again after the insertion.
   - **Sorting Check:** The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted, but the program does not ensure that the array is fully processed before calling `func_1`.

4. **Correct Solution:**
   - The program should continue to split elements and check the array until no more elements need to be split or the array is sorted.
   - This can be achieved by using a loop that continues until the array is sorted or no more elements greater than 10 are found.

### Conclusion:
The given program is **incorrect** because it only performs a single pass through the array and does not ensure that all elements are processed correctly. It may miss elements that need to be split after the initial pass, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness: **False**
