The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the decrease.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrease.**
