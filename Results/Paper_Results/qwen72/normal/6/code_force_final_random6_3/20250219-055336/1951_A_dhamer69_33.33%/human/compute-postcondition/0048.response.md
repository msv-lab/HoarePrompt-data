Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in the new input string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `count_1` is even and `s.count('11') == 1`, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.***
