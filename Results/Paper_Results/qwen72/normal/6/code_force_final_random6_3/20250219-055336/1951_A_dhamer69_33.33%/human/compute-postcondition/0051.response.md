Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`start` and `end`**: These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop because they are not modified within the loop body.
- **`t`**: This variable is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
- **`n` and `s`**: These variables are re-assigned in each iteration based on user input. After the loop completes, `n` will hold the last input integer, and `s` will hold the last input string.
- **`count_1`**: This variable is calculated in each iteration but is not stored or used outside the loop. Therefore, it does not affect the final output state.
