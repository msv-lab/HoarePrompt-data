Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the program follows the postcondition for the if part. If `count_1` is even, the program follows the postcondition for the else part, where if the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is satisfied; otherwise, the number of occurrences of '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.**
