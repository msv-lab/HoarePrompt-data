Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where a slime can be eaten by a neighbor on its right side. The program only checks the left neighbor, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 4
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
However, the program will output:
```
2 1 -1 1 -1
```
The 5th slime (with size 4) can actually be eaten by the 3rd slime (with size 3) after the 3rd slime eats the 4th slime (with size 1), but the program does not account for this possibility, leading to an incorrect result for the 5th slime.
