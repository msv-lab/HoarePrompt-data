The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 3, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except `ans[1]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx`, and `ans[2]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx`. `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is `last[1]`, `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `last[0] < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[0]` and `inx2` is also `last[0]`.**
