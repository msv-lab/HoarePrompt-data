The code snippet `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. This means that the last element of `last` is duplicated and added to the end of the list.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[1]` is equal to `a[0]`, `last` has one more element, which is the same as its previous last element.**
