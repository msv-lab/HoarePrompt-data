Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements set to `i + 1 - inx` for each index `i` where the loop condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met and `inx2 < inx`, otherwise elements remain -1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is the length of the list `a`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`a`**: This list remains unchanged from its initial state.
- **`i`**: This variable is the last element in the list `a`.
- **`last`**: This list remains unchanged and still contains the indices of the last occurrences of the elements in `a` up to each index.
- **`ans`**: This list is updated such that for each index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`), if `a[i]` is not less than `a[i-1]` and `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`. If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains -1.
- **`left`**: This list remains unchanged and still contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` up to each index.
- **`n`**: This variable remains the length of the list `a`.
