The objects in the loop head are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is not empty. The initial state provided indicates that `i` is `n-1`, but this state is not relevant to the loop head since `i` will be reassigned by the loop to each element in `a`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `a` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`a` must be a non-empty list, `i` is the first element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, and `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1**
