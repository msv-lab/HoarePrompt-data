The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the values of variables `i`, `l`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **YES**
