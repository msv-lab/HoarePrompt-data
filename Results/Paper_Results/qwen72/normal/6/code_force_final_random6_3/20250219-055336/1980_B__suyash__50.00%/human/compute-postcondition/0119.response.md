Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, and `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`. If `fav` is not equal to `l[2]`, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is equal to `l[2]`, `k` is also reduced by the value of `dic[l[2]]`. In this case, if `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `k`.***
