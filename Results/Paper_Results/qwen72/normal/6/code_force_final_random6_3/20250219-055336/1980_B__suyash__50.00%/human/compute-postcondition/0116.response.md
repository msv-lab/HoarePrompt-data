Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`.
   - `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`.
   - `k` is reduced by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The precondition provides context for these variables, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
