Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`, and `k` is updated based on the conditions described.

The code snippet `k -= dic[l[i]]` updates the value of `k` by subtracting the value of `dic[l[i]]` from `k`. Here, `l[i]` refers to the element at index 2 in the list `l`, and `dic[l[i]]` is the value in the dictionary `dic` corresponding to that element.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `l`, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer, `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`, and `k` is reduced by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.**
