Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n > 1` and `k` is less than the value of `2 ** counter - 1`. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program will incorrectly output `3 0` instead of `1 2` or `2 1`, which would maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The issue arises because the program always appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array, which may exceed `k` when `k` is small. This violates the requirement that the sum of the sequence should equal `k`.
