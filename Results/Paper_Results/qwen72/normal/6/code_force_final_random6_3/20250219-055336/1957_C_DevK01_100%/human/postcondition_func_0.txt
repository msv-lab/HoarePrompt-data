The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and returns the value of `dp[n-1]`, which represents the dynamic programming state for the (n-1)th position on a chessboard. The function maintains a list `dp` of two elements, updating it in each iteration to store the current and previous dynamic programming states. After the function concludes, the list `dp` contains the states for the (n-2)th and (n-1)th positions, and the final state of the program includes the returned value `dp[n-1]`.
