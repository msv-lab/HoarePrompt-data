Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the chessboard size `n` is 1 and `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, there should be exactly one configuration possible, which is placing the rook on the only available cell (1, 1). However, the function `func_1` in the program will return 1 for any `n` greater than or equal to 1, but it will not handle the case when `n` is 1 and `k` is 0 correctly. The program should return 1 for this specific case, but it does not. 

For example, with the input:
```
1
1 0
```
The expected output is:
```
1
```
But the program will output:
```
1
```
This is correct, but the logic in `func_1` is not designed to handle this edge case explicitly, which might lead to issues in more complex scenarios. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
