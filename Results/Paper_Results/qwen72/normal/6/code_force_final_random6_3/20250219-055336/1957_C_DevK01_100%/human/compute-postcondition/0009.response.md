Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements: [7, 13]; `i` is 3**. 

The first element of the list `dp` has been removed, so `dp` now contains the elements [7, 13]. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
