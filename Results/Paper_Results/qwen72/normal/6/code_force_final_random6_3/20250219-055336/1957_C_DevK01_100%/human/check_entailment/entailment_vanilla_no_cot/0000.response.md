Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions `n`.

2. **Processing the Moves**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the player and the computer place rooks on different positions.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because the player and the computer place rooks on the same position, and the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` with base cases `[1, 1]` (1 way to place 0 rooks and 1 way to place 1 rook).
   - For each subsequent position `i` from 2 to `n`, it calculates the number of ways to place `i` rooks using the formula:
     \[
     \text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times \text{dp}[i-2]
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the two scenarios:
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column without affecting the previous configuration.
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column and mirroring the previous configuration.
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program follows the problem's constraints and logic correctly, ensuring that the number of valid configurations is computed accurately for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
