### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Configuration:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the size of the chessboard `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not. This is done correctly:
     - If `a != b`, both the row and column are blocked, so `n` is decreased by 2.
     - If `a == b`, only one cell is blocked, so `n` is decreased by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of possible configurations for placing rooks on an `n x n` board where no two rooks attack each other.
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for the problem:
     - `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are initialized to 1, which is correct for the base cases.
     - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10**9 + 7)` is correct for calculating the number of configurations.
     - The use of `dp.pop(0)` ensures that the list `dp` always contains the last two computed values, which is efficient and correct.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The original assessment mentions an edge case where `n` is 1 and `k` is 0. However, the program correctly handles this case:
     - If `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, the function `func_1(1)` will return 1, which is the correct output.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle any valid `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and the dynamic programming approach ensures that it works correctly for all valid inputs.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations by reducing `n` based on the initial moves and then calling `func_1` with the updated `n`.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the edge case where `n` is 1 and `k` is 0 correctly, and the dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is appropriate for the problem. The program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
