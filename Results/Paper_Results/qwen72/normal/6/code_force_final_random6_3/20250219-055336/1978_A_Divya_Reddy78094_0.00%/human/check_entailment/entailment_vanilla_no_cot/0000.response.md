Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the highest number of pages, which is `nums[0] + nums[1]`.

This approach is correct because:
- By sorting the list in descending order, the two largest elements will be the first two elements in the list.
- Dividing the books into two piles such that each pile contains at least one book, and then reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile, will always maximize the total number of pages read.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem and will produce the correct output for the given test cases.
