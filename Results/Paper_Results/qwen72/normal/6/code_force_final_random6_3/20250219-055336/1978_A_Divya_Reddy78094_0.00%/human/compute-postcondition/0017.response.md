The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `books`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `books` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of pages in each book for a test case, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 for the number of books in each test case, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for the number of pages in each book.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns the sum of the pages of all books in that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `books` where each inner list contains integers representing the number of pages in each book for a test case. It returns a list of sums, where each sum is the total number of pages for the books in each test case.**
