Initial State: `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The list `nums` is sorted in descending order, meaning the largest element is at index 0 and the second largest element is at index 1.
2. The `print` statement is `print(nums[0] + nums[1])`.
3. `nums[0]` will be the largest element in the list.
4. `nums[1]` will be the second largest element in the list.
5. The `print` statement will output the sum of the largest and second largest elements in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the largest and second largest elements.

Output: **sum of the largest and second largest elements in the list `nums`**
