The provided code snippet is:
```
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Initial State:
- `res` must contain at least one element.

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the value of the variable `i`.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that the code will print whatever the value of `i` is at the time of execution, followed by a space.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i at the time of execution) followed by a space**
