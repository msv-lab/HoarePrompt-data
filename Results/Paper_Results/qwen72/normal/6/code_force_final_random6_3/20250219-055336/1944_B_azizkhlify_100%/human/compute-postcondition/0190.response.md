Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`.
   - The expression `a[i]` is used twice in the `print` statement.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is `n`.
   - We need to find the value of `a[n]`.
   - The initial state also mentions that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[i]` must be an index in the list `r` such that `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.
   - Let's denote `a[i]` as `x`. Therefore, `r[x - 1]` is 2.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `r[x - 1]` is 2, `x` must be an integer such that `r[x - 1]` is 2.
   - The `print` statement will print `x` twice, followed by a space.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `x` (which is `a[i]`) is not provided, but it is known that `r[x - 1]` is 2.
   - Therefore, the output will be `x x `.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of a[i] such that r[a[i] - 1] is 2)**
