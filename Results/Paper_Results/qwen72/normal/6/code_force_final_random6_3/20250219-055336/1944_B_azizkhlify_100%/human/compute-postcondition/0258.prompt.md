Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `2 * n`, the value at index `a[j] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2` and the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2, then `ul` is increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `ul`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is 2 and `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then the element at that index is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is not 2, the element at that index remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2` and the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then the element at that index is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
