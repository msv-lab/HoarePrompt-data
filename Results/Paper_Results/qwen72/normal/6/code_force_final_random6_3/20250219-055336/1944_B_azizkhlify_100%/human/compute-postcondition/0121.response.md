The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `i`, which is from `n` to `2 * n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at `n`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**
