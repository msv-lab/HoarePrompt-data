Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value.**

The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the expression `a[i] - 1` evaluates to `a[n + 1] - 1`. Therefore, the element in the list `r` at the index `a[n + 1] - 1` is set to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
