To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`.

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The value at index `a[0] - 1` in `l` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the value at index `a[0] - 1` in `l` is incremented by 1.**
