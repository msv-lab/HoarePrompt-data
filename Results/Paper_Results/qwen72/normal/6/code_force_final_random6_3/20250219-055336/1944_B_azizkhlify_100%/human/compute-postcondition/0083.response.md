Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - `i` is the last element of `res`.
   - The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).
   - `i` is the last element of `res`, which means it is the index of the last element in the list `res`.
   - The value of `a[i]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `i`.

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is the last element of `res`, and `res` contains elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `a[i]` must be one of those elements.
   - Additionally, the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which means that the element `a[i]` has been processed in some way that changed the value in `r`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of the last element in the list `res`)**

This means that the exact numerical value of `a[i]` is not provided, but it is the value of the last element in the list `res` that meets the specified conditions.
