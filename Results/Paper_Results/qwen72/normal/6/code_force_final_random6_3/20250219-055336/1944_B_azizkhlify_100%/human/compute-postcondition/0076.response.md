Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list that must contain at least two elements.
- `i` is the second element of `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `res` and will not move to a new line after printing (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since the exact values of the elements in `res` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the second element of `res`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the second element of the list res)**
