Output State: **`res` is a list with all elements processed, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0 and `ur` is `ur + 2`. Otherwise, the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
