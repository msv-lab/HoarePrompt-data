Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is equal to `ur + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The value of `ur` is incremented by 2, so `ul` (which was equal to `ur` in the initial state) is now equal to `ur + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
