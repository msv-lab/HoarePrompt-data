Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, `res` contains all elements added during the loop execution, `i` has iterated over each element in `res`, if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `res` contains all elements added during the loop execution. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 for any `i` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each occurrence. If at any point `ul` becomes equal to `ur`, the loop breaks, and `ul` and `ur` retain their values at that point. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged and is not equal to `ur`. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing them in the list `a`.
- The initial state variables `n`, `k`, `res`, `i`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `a` is now a list of integers based on the user's input.
