The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to `n + 2`, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` is less than `2 * n`.

State: **`res` is a list with all elements processed, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0 and `ur` is `ur + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was not 2, then the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged.**
