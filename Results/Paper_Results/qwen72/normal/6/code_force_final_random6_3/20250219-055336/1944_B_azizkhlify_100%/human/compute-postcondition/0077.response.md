The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `res`. If `res` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the second element of `res`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must contain at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `res`.

State: **`res` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `res`**
