Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with all elements processed, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0 and `ur` is `ur + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was not 2, then the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged.***
