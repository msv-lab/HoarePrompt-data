The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the third element of the list `res`, followed by a space. 

Based on the initial state, `res` is a list that must contain at least three elements, and `i` is the third element of `res`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `res` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the third element of `res`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the third element of the list res)**
