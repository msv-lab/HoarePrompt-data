Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one element, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `c` is the first element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 1] and `ans` is `zeroes`.***
