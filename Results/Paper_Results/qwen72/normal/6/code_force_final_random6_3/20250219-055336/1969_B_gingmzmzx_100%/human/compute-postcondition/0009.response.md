Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`, and the current value of `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if the element at index 1 in the list `cnt` is greater than 0.
- If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.
- The other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `c`) are not affected by this code snippet.
- The current value of `c` is 0, and it is the first integer in the list `s`.
- The initial value of `ans` was 0, so if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0.
