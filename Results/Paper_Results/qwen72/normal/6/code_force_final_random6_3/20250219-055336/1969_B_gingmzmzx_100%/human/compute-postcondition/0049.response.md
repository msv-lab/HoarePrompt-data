The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], and `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for which there is at least one 1 before them, plus the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of 0s in `s` minus the number of 0s that have already been counted before each 1.**
