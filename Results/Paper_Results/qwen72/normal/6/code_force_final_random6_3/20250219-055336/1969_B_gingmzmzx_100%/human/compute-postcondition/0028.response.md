Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the new `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the total number of pairs (i, j) such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`**

The code snippet resets the list `cnt` to [0, 0], which means `cnt[0]` (the number of zeros) and `cnt[1]` (the number of ones) are both set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
