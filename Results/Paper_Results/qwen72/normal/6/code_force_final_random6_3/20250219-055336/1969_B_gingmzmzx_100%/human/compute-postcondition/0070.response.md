Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least three elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `2 * zeroes + 1`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 3`. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `3 * zeroes - 3`.***
