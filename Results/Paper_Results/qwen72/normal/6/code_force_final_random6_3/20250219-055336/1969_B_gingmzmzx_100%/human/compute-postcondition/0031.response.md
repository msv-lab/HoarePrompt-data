Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the new `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `c` is the first element in `s`, and `s` is a list of integers, `c` can be either 0 or 1 (assuming `s` only contains 0s and 1s, as no other values are mentioned). If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented to 1, making `cnt` [1, 0]. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented to 1, making `cnt` [0, 1]. The other variables remain unchanged.
