Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the number of beautiful pairs in each test case. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if both \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and for each test case, it initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the remainders of the numbers in the array when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. The key idea is to use these remainders to identify potential pairs that satisfy the conditions.

However, the logic used in the program to count the beautiful pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts pairs by adding the number of times the remainders have been seen before. This approach does not correctly account for the conditions \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).

To correctly count the beautiful pairs, we need to:
1. For each number \(a_i\), calculate the required remainder \(r_x\) such that \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\).
2. Similarly, calculate the required remainder \(r_y\) such that \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\).
3. Count the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where both conditions are satisfied.

The current implementation does not correctly handle these conditions. Instead, it simply adds the counts of the remainders seen so far, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, in the test case:
- \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\)
  - The program should identify the pairs \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\) as beautiful, but it does not correctly do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
