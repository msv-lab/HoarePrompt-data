Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and value 1, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

The code snippet updates the `mod_y_map` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `mod_y_key` and the value is 1. Since `mod_y_map` was initially empty, it now contains one key-value pair. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
