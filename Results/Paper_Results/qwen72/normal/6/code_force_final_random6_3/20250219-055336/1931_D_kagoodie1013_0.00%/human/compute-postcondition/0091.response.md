Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that has been fully iterated through. `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the corresponding `arr`. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that have been updated for each tuple, where `mod_x_map` contains the count of each unique `num % x` and `mod_y_map` contains the count of each unique `num % y` for the corresponding `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the `test_cases` list has been completely processed. For each tuple in `test_cases`, the `count` variable has been calculated based on the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the corresponding `arr`. The `results` list now contains the final `count` value for each tuple. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries have been populated with the counts of unique remainders when each element in `arr` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, for each tuple.
