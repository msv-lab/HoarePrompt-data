Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`.
- Since `mod_y` was already defined as `num % y`, `mod_y_key` is now equal to `mod_y`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
