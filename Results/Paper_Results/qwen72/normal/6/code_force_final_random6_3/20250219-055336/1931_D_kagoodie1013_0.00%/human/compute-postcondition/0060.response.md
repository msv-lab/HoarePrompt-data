The code appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. The value of `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % x` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % y` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_y_key`.**
