The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements `(n, x, y)` and a list of `n` integers `a`. Each `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and each `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the sum of values calculated for each `arr` in `test_cases`. Specifically, for each `num` in `arr`, the function computes `mod_x_map.get(num % x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)`, where `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that store the count of each unique remainder when the numbers in `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing a tuple (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a. It returns a list of results, where each result is the sum of the counts of remainders when each number in a is divided by x and y, as stored in dictionaries mod_x_map and mod_y_map.**
