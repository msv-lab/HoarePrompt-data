Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, except that the variable `mod_y` is now assigned the value of `num % y`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
