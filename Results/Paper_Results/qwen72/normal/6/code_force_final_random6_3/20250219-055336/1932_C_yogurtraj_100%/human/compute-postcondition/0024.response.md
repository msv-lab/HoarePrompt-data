Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, if the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` * `a[l - 2] % m` % `m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`; otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m` * `a[l - 1] % m` % `m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros, with the last element set to the new value of `k`, and the character at index `i` in the string `t` is not 'R'.**
