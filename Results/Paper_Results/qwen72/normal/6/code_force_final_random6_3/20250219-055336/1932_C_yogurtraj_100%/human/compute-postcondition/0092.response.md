Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is -1, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of the modulo operation `k % m` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is 0, `q1` is 0, `q2` is an index that has been updated according to the rules in the loop based on the characters in `t` and the initial values of `q1` and `q2`, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**
