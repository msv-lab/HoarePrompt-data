Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a program that handles multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
