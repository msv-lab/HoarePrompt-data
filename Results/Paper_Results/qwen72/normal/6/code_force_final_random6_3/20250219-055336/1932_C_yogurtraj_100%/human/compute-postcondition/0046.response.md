Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the conditions described in the loop, but their final values depend on the specific characters in `t` and the length of `t`. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `l`, `y`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` remain unchanged, except for `a` which is now a list of integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, but the specific values of these inputs are not known, so they are described as being updated to integers provided by the user input.
