Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the product of the elements of the array for each command. Specifically, the logic for updating the product and the indices for the elements to be removed is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```

Actual Output:
```
0 2 4 4
```

The issue arises because the program incorrectly updates the product and the indices when processing the commands. For instance, when the last command is 'L', the program should output `1` as the remainder, but it outputs `4` instead. This indicates that the logic for handling the removal of elements and updating the product is not implemented correctly.
