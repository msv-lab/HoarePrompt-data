Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `m` from user input, followed by a list of `n` integers `a` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'L' and 'R'. It then computes a list `y` of `n` integers, where each element is the result of a series of modulo operations based on the characters in `s` and the values in `a`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list `y` is printed for each test case, and the function is ready to process the next test case if any. **
