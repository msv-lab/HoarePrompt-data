Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) points to the right (`>`). However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
In this case, the robot starts at `(1, 1)`. The path the robot takes is:
1. Moves right to `(1, 2)` (arrow in `(1, 2)` points left, so it moves left to `(1, 1)`).
2. Moves right to `(1, 2)` again (arrow in `(1, 2)` points left, so it moves left to `(1, 1)`).
3. Moves down to `(2, 1)` (arrow in `(2, 1)` points right, so it moves right to `(2, 2)`).
4. Moves right to `(2, 3)` (arrow in `(2, 3)` points left, so it moves left to `(2, 2)`).
5. Moves right to `(2, 3)` again (arrow in `(2, 3)` points left, so it moves left to `(2, 2)`).
6. Moves up to `(1, 2)` (arrow in `(1, 2)` points left, so it moves left to `(1, 1)`).
7. Moves right to `(1, 2)` again (arrow in `(1, 2)` points left, so it moves left to `(1, 1)`).

The robot will get stuck in a loop and will never reach `(2, 4)`. However, the program will output `Yes` because `b[n - 2]` (which is `b[2]`) is `>`. This is incorrect, and hence the program is not correct for all potential cases.
