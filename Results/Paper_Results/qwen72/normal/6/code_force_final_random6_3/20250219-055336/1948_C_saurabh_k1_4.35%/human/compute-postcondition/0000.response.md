The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of the variable `t` is relevant here as it represents the number of test cases, which should correspond to the input value.

However, the state of `t`, `n`, and the list of tuples (arrows) are not directly part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted. The only adjustment we can make is to ensure that the input value is positive, which will allow the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 10^4)**

Note: The state of `t`, `n`, and the list of tuples (arrows) are not adjusted because they are not part of the loop head. The loop will execute based on the input value, which must be a positive integer for the loop to run at least once.
