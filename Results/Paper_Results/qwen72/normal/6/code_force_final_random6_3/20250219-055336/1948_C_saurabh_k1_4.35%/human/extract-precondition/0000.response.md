Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples (each containing two strings of length n with characters '<' or '>'), representing the arrows in the grid for each test case.**
