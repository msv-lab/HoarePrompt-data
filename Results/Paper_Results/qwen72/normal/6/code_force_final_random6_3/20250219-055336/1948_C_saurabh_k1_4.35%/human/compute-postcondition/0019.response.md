The code snippet `b = list(map(str, input()))` reads a new input from the user and converts it into a list of strings, where each string is a character from the new input. This operation updates the value of `b` to this new list. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, and `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. The initial state also specifies a condition regarding the element at index `n - 2` in `b`, but this condition will be re-evaluated after the new input is assigned to `b`.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.**
