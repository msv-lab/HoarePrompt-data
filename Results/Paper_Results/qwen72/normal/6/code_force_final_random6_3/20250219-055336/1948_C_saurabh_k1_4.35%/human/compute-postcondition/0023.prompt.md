Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples (each containing two strings of length n with characters '<' or '>'), representing the arrows in the grid for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
