Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row points to the left (`<`). If it does, the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

However, this logic is flawed. The robot's movement is determined by a combination of its initial move and the direction of the arrows in the cells it visits. The program's logic only checks the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row, which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Position and Movement**: The robot starts at (1, 1) and must move to the right or down. If the robot moves to the right, it will follow the arrow in the cell (1, 2). If it moves down, it will follow the arrow in the cell (2, 1).

2. **Traversal**: The robot must be able to navigate through the grid and reach the cell (2, n). This involves checking the arrows in the cells and ensuring that the robot can move in a way that allows it to reach the target cell.

3. **Key Insight**: The robot can only reach the cell (2, n) if it can move to the second row and then move to the right in the second row until it reaches the last column. Therefore, we need to check if there is a way for the robot to move to the second row and then move to the right in the second row without getting stuck.

The provided program does not perform a thorough check of the grid to ensure the robot can reach the target cell. It only checks the second-to-last column of the second row, which is not enough to determine the correctness of the path.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell. Here is a more detailed approach:

1. **Simulate the Robot's Movement**:
   - Start at (1, 1).
   - Move to the right or down based on the arrow in the current cell.
   - Continue moving until the robot either reaches (2, n) or gets stuck.

2. **Check for Stuck Conditions**:
   - If the robot gets stuck in a loop or cannot move to the right in the second row, it cannot reach (2, n).

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid.

Correctness: **False**
