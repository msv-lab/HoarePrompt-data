Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually. For each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions for a "stair" and a "peak" as specified. If the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`), it prints "STAIR". If the digits form a peak (`a < b` and `b > c`), it prints "PEAK". If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program handles all the given test cases correctly and produces the expected output for each.

Correctness: **True**
