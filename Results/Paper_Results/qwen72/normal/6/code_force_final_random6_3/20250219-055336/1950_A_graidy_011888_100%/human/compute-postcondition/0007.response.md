The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs a constant string `'PEAK'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **PEAK**
