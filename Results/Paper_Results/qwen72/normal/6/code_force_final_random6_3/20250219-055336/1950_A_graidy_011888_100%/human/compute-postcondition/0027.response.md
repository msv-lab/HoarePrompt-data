The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might be using or generating test cases internally where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these test cases.

Since the output is not clearly defined, I will assume that the function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, without more specific information about the output, I can only describe the parameters and the general context.

Functionality: **The function generates or uses test cases internally, where each test case involves three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) and an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). The function returns a result based on these test cases, but the specific output is not provided.**
