Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak by using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions described in the problem statement. The output format matches the expected output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE".
   - The program also correctly handles cases where the digits are in descending order (e.g., `3 2 1`), which should result in "NONE".
   - The program correctly handles cases where the digits do not form either a stair or a peak (e.g., `4 1 7`), which should result in "NONE".

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`. It correctly states that the function processes `n` test cases, checks the conditions for each test case, and prints the appropriate output.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases, and it adheres to the given constraints. The function summary also aligns with the program's behavior.

Final: **True**
