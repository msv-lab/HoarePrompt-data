You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all `n` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak by using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions described in the problem statement. The output format matches the expected output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are in descending order (e.g., `3 2 1`), which should result in "NONE".

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
