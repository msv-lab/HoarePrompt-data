### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values and assigns it to `m`.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as `m / k_i` and stores these values in the list `c`.
   - The program computes the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function.
   - It then divides each element in `c` by the HCF to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the program prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Analysis of the Approach:**
   - The product `m` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k_i` values, but it is not necessary to use the LCM. Instead, the product of all `k_i` values is used, which is a common multiple but not necessarily the smallest.
   - The bets `m / k_i` are calculated to ensure that the return for each outcome is a multiple of `m`, which is a large enough number to satisfy the condition.
   - Dividing each bet by the HCF of the bets ensures that the bets are reduced to the smallest possible values while maintaining the ratios.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` checks if the total bet is less than the return for any outcome. If this condition is not met, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses the product of all `k_i` values, which can be very large and may lead to integer overflow for large values of `k_i` or `n`.
   - The HCF calculation is correct, but the program does not handle the case where the HCF is 1, which can still lead to the condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` being false.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic is generally sound, but it may fail for large inputs due to integer overflow.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` is the correct way to check if the bets are valid, but the program does not handle the edge case where the HCF is 1 and the sum of bets is still greater than or equal to `m / hcf`.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but may fail for large inputs due to integer overflow. However, given the constraints (1 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the product of all `k_i` values will not exceed the maximum limit for Python's integer type, so the program should work correctly within these constraints.

**Correctness: True**
