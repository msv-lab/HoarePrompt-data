Output State: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1` and is greater than or equal to 0, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`.**
