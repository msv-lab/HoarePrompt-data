Output State: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, if `tot >= k`, then `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged, the states of `C` and `D` are not affected, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1.**
