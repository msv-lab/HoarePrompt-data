### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from an array `a`. Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, and Bob simply removes the picked element from `a`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX, but since he cannot append to `c`, his strategy is to remove the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` from `a`.

3. **Frequency Analysis:**
   - The program correctly calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `a` using a list `freq` of size `n + 1`.
   - This ensures that the program can track how many times each integer appears in `a`.

4. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice, it can be ignored because both Alice and Bob can pick it, and it will not affect the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it is added to a counter `cou`.
   - If the counter `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear at all, the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the smallest integer that will be the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.
   - The counter `cou` ensures that the program only considers the first two unique integers that appear exactly once, which is the correct approach to determine the MEX in this context.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all integers appear at least twice, which results in the MEX being 0.
   - The program also handles the case where the array `a` is empty, which is not possible given the constraints but is implicitly handled by the logic.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.

- **Function `func_1` Execution:**
  - **Frequency Calculation:**
    - `freq = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a list to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
    - The loop `for i in arr: freq[i] += 1` correctly updates the frequency of each integer.
  - **MEX Determination:**
    - `cou = 0` initializes a counter to track the number of unique integers that appear exactly once.
    - The loop `for i in range(n + 1):` iterates through all possible integers from 0 to `n`.
    - **Condition 1: `if freq[i] >= 2: continue`**
      - This condition correctly ignores integers that appear at least twice, as they can be picked by both players and do not affect the MEX.
    - **Condition 2: `if freq[i] == 1: cou += 1`**
      - This condition increments the counter `cou` for integers that appear exactly once.
    - **Condition 3: `if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0: print(i); break`**
      - If `cou` reaches 2, it means that two unique integers have been found, and the MEX is the next integer `i`.
      - If `freq[i] == 0`, it means that the integer `i` does not appear in `arr`, and `i` is the MEX.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` when both Alice and Bob play optimally. The frequency analysis and MEX determination logic are accurate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
