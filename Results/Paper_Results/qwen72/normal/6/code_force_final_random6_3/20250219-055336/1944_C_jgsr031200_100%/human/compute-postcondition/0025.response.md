Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`.
- The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `i` is 1.
- If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is set to 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `cou` remains 1 and the program continues without any changes to the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Value of `freq[i]`**: The value of `freq[i]` (where `i` is 1) is not explicitly given, but it is defined as the number of times the integer 1 appears in `arr`.
3. **Behavior of the Code**: The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`, which is 1, regardless of the value of `freq[i]` or any other conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
