Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` only checks the frequency of elements in the array `arr` and prints the first index where the frequency is less than 2 or 0. This approach does not consider the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c` respectively.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
- **Expected Output:** 5
- **Actual Output:** 5

However, the program will output 5, which is incorrect because the optimal strategy would result in a different MEX. Here's a step-by-step optimal game play:

1. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice picks 0. `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `c = [0]`.
2. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob picks 1. `a = [2, 3, 4]`, `c = [0]`.
3. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice picks 2. `a = [3, 4]`, `c = [0, 2]`.
4. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob picks 3. `a = [4]`, `c = [0, 2]`.
5. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice picks 4. `a = []`, `c = [0, 2, 4]`.

At the end, `c = [0, 2, 4]`, and the MEX of `c` is 1, not 5. The program does not correctly handle this case, hence it is incorrect.
