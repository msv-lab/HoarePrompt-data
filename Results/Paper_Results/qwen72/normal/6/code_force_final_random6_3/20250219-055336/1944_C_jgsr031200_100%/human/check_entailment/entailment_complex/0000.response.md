### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates over `arr` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each integer in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Play Logic:**
   - The function then iterates over the range `0` to `n` to find the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob are constructing.
   - It uses a counter `cou` to keep track of the number of unique integers encountered.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `arr`, it increments `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear in `arr` (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to choose integers that appear exactly once in `arr` to ensure they are included in `c`.
   - The optimal strategy for Bob is to choose integers that appear exactly once in `arr` to prevent Alice from including them in `c`.
   - The function correctly identifies the first integer that either appears exactly once (if there are at least two such integers) or does not appear at all in `arr`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `arr` contains no unique integers, the function will print the first integer that does not appear in `arr`.
   - If `arr` contains exactly one unique integer, the function will print the next integer that does not appear in `arr`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the MEX of the array `c` that would be constructed if both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The frequency calculation and the loop to find the MEX are both accurate and handle the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
