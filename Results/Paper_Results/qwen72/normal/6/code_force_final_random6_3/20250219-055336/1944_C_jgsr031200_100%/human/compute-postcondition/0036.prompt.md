Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 1 if `freq[i]` is 1, otherwise `cou` remains 0. `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is 1. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cou` remains 1, and the program continues without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and `cou` remains 1. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[2]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
