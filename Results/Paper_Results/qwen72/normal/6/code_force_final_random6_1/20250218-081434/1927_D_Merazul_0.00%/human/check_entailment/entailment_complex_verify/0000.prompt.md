You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the range from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a` for the last test case, `a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()` for the last test case, `k` is the last element returned by the function `R()` for the last test case, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()` for the last test case, `f` is 1 if every integer from 1 to `k` is in either `a` or `b` for the last test case, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is the number of elements in the range from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b` for the last test case, `i` is `k + 1`, `u` and `v` are `False` because the loop has finished and `i` is no longer in the range from 1 to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k`, two sets of integers `a` and `b`, and then checks if every integer from 1 to `k` is present in either `a` or `b`. It also calculates the number of elements in the range from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b` (`m`), and the number of elements in the range from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a` (`n`). The function prints "YES" if every integer from 1 to `k` is in either `a` or `b` and both `m` and `n` are non-negative; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the variables `a`, `b`, `k`, `m`, `n`, and `f` hold the values from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to checking the presence of numbers in sets and performing some bitwise operations. However, it does not address the task of finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges in an array.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program does not produce this output and instead outputs something unrelated. This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
