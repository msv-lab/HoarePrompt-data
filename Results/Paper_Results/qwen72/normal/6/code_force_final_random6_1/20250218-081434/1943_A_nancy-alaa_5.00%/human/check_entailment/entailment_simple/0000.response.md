### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and is present in `a`.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and is present in `a` to prevent Alice from picking it.
   - If both players play optimally, the final MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `a` (since Alice will always pick it first if it appears exactly once).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp` (the counter), it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because `i` is the smallest integer not in `arr`, and thus not in `c`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because `i` is the smallest integer that appears exactly once, and Alice will pick it first.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`. This is correct because it marks the first occurrence of an integer that appears exactly once.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` and each appears more than once, the loop will not break until `i` reaches `n-1`, and the MEX will be `n`.
   - If there is at least one integer that appears exactly once, the loop will break at the smallest such integer.

5. **Final State:**
   - The final state of the program is correct as it prints the MEX for each test case based on the optimal strategy.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, ensuring that the MEX of the array `c` is determined accurately for each test case.
