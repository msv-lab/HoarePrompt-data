Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is True.
- Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: The initial state clearly states that `i` is 2.
2. **Conditions**:
   - The code snippet does not depend on the conditions involving `mpp` or `first`. It simply prints the value of `i`.
   - The conditions are provided to give context to the state of the program, but they do not affect the value of `i` that is printed.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
