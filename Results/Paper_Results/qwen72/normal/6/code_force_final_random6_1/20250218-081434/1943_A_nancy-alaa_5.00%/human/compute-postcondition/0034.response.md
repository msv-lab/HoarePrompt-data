Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 3), `i` is 2. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
