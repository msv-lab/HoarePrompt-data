Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
- `mpp[i]` is 1.
- `first` is true.

The print statement is:
```
print(i)
```

The value of `i` is explicitly given as 0. Therefore, when the print statement executes, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
