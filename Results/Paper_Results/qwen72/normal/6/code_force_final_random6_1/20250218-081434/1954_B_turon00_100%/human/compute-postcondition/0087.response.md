Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
   - Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state and the variables described do not influence the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, or `ans`.

Output: **-1**
