The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `_`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0**
