Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` in the last segment of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a`, including the last segment.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` starting from the end of the list.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a`, including the last segment.

3. **What is Printed:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

4. **Determining the Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a`.
   - Since `ans` is not equal to `n`, it means that there is at least one segment in the list `a` where the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` is less than the length of the list `a`.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in the list `a` and the value of `tmp`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a`, and ans is not equal to the length of the list `a`)**
