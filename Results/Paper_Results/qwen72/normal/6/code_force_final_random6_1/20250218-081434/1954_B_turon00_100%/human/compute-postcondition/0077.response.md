The code snippet `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`, or `ans`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**
