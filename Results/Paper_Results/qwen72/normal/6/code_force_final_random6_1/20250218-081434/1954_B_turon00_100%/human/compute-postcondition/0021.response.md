Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
- Initially, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0 (if `a[i-1]` is not equal to `tmp`) or `ans` is `n` (if `a[i-1]` is equal to `tmp`).
- In both cases, since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to 0.
- Therefore, the final value of `ans` is 0, and `cnt` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
