Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the variable `cnt` to 0, but since `cnt` was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid.
