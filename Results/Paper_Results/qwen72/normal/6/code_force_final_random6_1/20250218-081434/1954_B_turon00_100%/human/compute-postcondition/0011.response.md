The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`n`) and the value of `cnt` (which is 0). Since `n` is greater than 0, the minimum value will be 0. Therefore, `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**
