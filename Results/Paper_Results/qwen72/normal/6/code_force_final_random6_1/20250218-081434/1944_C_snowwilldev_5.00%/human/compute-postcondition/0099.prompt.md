Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The function should also handle an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is 0 or 1, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of times `cnt[i]` was 1 for `i` from 0 to `N-1`, and the loop will break if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or if `cnt[i]` is 0 for any `i` in the range from 0 to `N-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or a non-unique element was found, the loop breaks and the final value of `i` is the index where the loop broke. Otherwise, the loop completes and `i` is `N-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `N-1` if it completes all iterations, `t` is the number of times an element with a count of 1 has been encountered before the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
