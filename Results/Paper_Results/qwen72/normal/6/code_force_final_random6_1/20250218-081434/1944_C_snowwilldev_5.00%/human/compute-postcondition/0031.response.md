Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0 or 1, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `i` is 2. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tc` is set to 1 if `cnt[2]` is 1, and remains 0 if `cnt[2]` is not 1.***
