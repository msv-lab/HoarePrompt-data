Output State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, initialized to an empty state.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cnt = defaultdict(int)` reinitializes `cnt` to a new defaultdict with default type int, which is an empty dictionary.
- All other variables (`tc`, `N`, `a`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `cnt` being a defaultdict with counts of elements in `a` is reset to an empty state.
