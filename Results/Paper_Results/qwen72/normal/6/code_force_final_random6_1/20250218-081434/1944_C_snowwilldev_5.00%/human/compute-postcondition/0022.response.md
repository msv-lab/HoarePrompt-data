Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1. If `t` was 0 and `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is now 1. If `t` was 1 and `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is now 2. If `t` is now greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.***
