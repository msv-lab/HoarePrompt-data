Functionality: ** The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `q` (1 <= n, q <= 10^5), a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list of two integers `[b, x]`, and a list of `q` positive integers `queries`. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and prints the resulting list of values. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the program state is such that all inputs have been consumed and all results have been printed. **
