You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `q` (1 <= n, q <= 10^5), a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list of two integers `[b, x]`, and a list of `q` positive integers `queries`. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and prints the resulting list of values. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the program state is such that all inputs have been consumed and all results have been printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate a series of operations on an initially empty array.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer queries about the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries.
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
     - For each operation:
       - If the operation is of type 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation is of type 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself. However, the code provided appends only one copy of the current array, which is incorrect.
     - After all operations, it processes the queries by appending the `k`-th element of the array to the `result` list. The `k`-th element is found using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the case where `k` is larger than the length of the array.

3. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The error in `func_1` is in the handling of type 2 operations. The code should append `x` copies of the current array, but it only appends one copy.
   - The correct way to handle type 2 operations is to use a loop to append `x` copies of the current array.

4. **Correcting the Error:**
   - The correct implementation for type 2 operations should be:
     ```python
     if op_type == 2:
         array.extend(array * value)
     ```

5. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - After correcting the error, the function should correctly simulate the operations and answer the queries.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, which is correct.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the handling of type 2 operations.
- The corrected program is correct and should work as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is correct.)
