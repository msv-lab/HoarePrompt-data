Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value) such that op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is a positive integer. `queries` is a list of positive integers, each representing a query index k, where 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after all operations. `array` is a list that has been modified according to the operations specified in the `operations` list. If an operation is of type 1, the value is appended to the `array`. If an operation is of type 2, the `array` is extended by duplicating its current elements. `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in queries:
    result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples, `queries` is a non-empty list of positive integers, `array` is a list modified according to the operations, `result` is a list containing the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array`, `k` is the first element of `queries`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples, `queries` is a non-empty list of positive integers, `array` is a list modified according to the operations, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array`, `k` is the second element of `queries`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples, `queries` is a non-empty list of positive integers, `array` is a list modified according to the operations, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` of `array` where `k` is the third element of `queries`, and the last element of `result` is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
