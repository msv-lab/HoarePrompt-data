The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the range of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `_` has just completed one iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `t` is the upper limit and does not change, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers, `n` is the first integer input, `q` is the second integer input, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1**
