The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect this change. Since `t` is an input integer and does not change, it remains the same.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, it now needs to be adjusted to reflect this new value. If `_` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it is now `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`**
