The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the initial size of an array.
- `operations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `(op_type, value)`. `op_type` is either 1 or 2, and `value` is a positive integer. These tuples represent operations to be performed on the array.
- `queries` is a list of positive integers, each representing a query index `k`, where `1 <= k <= min(10^18, c)` and `c` is the size of the array after all operations.

The function returns a list `result` containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` of the array for each `k` in `queries`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple contains an operation type (1 or 2) and a positive integer value, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It returns a list `result` containing the elements at the specified indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query index `k` in `queries`, after performing the operations on the initial array of size `n`.**
