Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the second type of operation (b=2) where the array is extended with x copies of itself. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` only extends the array with one copy of itself, regardless of the value of x. This means that the program will not work correctly for any input where the second operation is used with x > 1.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 3
1 3
2 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
Expected output:
```
1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2
```
Actual output with the given program:
```
1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2
```
However, the array after the operations should be:
```
a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
```
The program fails to correctly extend the array with the specified number of copies, leading to incorrect results for the queries.
