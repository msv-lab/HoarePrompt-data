To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the context in which the `result` variable is defined.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5\).
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains two integers.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `q` is the second integer input.
- `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

### Analysis:
- The `*result` in the `print` statement means that the elements of the `result` list will be unpacked and printed separated by spaces.
- The function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` is not provided, so we can only infer the output based on the given information.

### What is `result`?
- `result` is the output of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `result`. However, we can infer that `result` is likely a list of values, possibly integers, that are the results of processing the `operations` and `queries` based on the input `n`.

### Output:
- The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list separated by spaces.
- Without the exact definition of `func_1`, we cannot provide the exact numerical values of `result`.

Output: **[elements of result separated by spaces] (where result is the list returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**
