Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function processes the operations and constructs the array `array` based on the operations.
   - For operations of type 1, it appends the value to the array.
   - For operations of type 2, it duplicates the current array `x` times.
   - After processing all operations, it answers the queries by accessing the elements at the specified indices `(k - 1) % len(array)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the operations, and the queries.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the results for the current test case and prints them.

3. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` has a potential issue with the implementation of operation type 2. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` only duplicates the array once, regardless of the value of `x`. This is incorrect because the operation should duplicate the array `x` times.
   - The correct implementation should be `array.extend(array * (value - 1))` to ensure the array is duplicated `x` times.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation of the operation type 2 should be:
     ```python
     if op_type == 2:
         array.extend(array * (value - 1))
     ```

5. **Impact on Correctness**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` will not correctly handle operation type 2, leading to incorrect array sizes and, consequently, incorrect query results.
   - This means that the function `func_1` does not meet the problem description, and thus the entire program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
