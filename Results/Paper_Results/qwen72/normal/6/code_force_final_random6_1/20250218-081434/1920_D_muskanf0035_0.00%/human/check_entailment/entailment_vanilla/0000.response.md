### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate a series of operations on an initially empty array.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer queries about the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries.
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
     - For each operation:
       - If the operation is of type 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation is of type 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself. However, the code provided appends only one copy of the current array, which is incorrect.
     - After all operations, it processes the queries by appending the `k`-th element of the array to the `result` list. The `k`-th element is found using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the case where `k` is larger than the length of the array.

3. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The error in `func_1` is in the handling of type 2 operations. The code should append `x` copies of the current array, but it only appends one copy.
   - The correct way to handle type 2 operations is to use a loop to append `x` copies of the current array.

4. **Correcting the Error:**
   - The correct implementation for type 2 operations should be:
     ```python
     if op_type == 2:
         array.extend(array * value)
     ```

5. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - After correcting the error, the function should correctly simulate the operations and answer the queries.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, which is correct.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the handling of type 2 operations.
- The corrected program is correct and should work as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is correct.)
