The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `queries`. This updates the value of `queries` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers, `n` is the first integer input, `q` is the second integer input, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user.**
