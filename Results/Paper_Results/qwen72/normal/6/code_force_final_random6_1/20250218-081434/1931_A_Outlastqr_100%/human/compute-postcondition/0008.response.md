Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, `word` is the string 'a' concatenated with the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and then concatenated with 'z'.**

Explanation: The code concatenates the string 'a' with the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string and then concatenates 'z' to the result. The value of `word` is updated to this new string. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition for `n` being greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52 still holds.
