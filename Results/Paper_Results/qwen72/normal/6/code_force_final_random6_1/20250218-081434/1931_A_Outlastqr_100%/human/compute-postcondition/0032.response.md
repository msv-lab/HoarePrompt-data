Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `word` is now the string formed by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string with 'zz'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, and `word` is an empty string.
- The code snippet `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` updates the `word` variable by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string with the string 'zz'.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `word` is the string formed by the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.
