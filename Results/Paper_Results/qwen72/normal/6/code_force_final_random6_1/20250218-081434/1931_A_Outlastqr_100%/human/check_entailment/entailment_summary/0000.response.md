Reasoning:  
The program is designed to decode an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) back into a lexicographically smallest three-letter word. The logic is based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Case when `n > 52`**:
   - The maximum sum for a three-letter word is 78 (i.e., 'z' + 'z' + 'z' = 26 + 26 + 26).
   - If `n > 52`, the program adds the character at index `n - 53` to the word followed by 'zz'.
   - This is correct because the smallest possible word for `n > 52` should start with the smallest possible letter that, when combined with 'zz', gives the sum `n`. For example, for `n = 70`, the word is 'rzz' because 'r' (18th letter) + 'z' (26th letter) + 'z' (26th letter) = 70.

2. **Case when `n > 27` and `n ≤ 52`**:
   - If `n > 27`, the program adds 'a' to the word, followed by the character at index `n - 28`, and then 'z'.
   - This is correct because the smallest possible word for `n > 27` should start with 'a' and the next smallest letter that, when combined with 'z', gives the sum `n`. For example, for `n = 55`, the word is 'czz' because 'a' (1st letter) + 'c' (3rd letter) + 'z' (26th letter) = 55.

3. **Case when `n == 27`**:
   - The program outputs 'aay'.
   - This is correct because 'a' (1st letter) + 'a' (1st letter) + 'y' (25th letter) = 27, and 'aay' is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 27.

4. **Case when `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`**:
   - The program outputs 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`.
   - This is correct because for `n` in this range, the smallest possible word should start with 'aa' and the next smallest letter that sums to `n`. For example, for `n = 48`, the word is 'auz' because 'a' (1st letter) + 'a' (1st letter) + 'u' (21st letter) = 48.

The program handles all the given cases correctly and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
