The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as the variable `t` (the number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The state of `n` and `alphabet` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
