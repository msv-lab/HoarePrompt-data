Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the encoded integer `n` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**: The `alphabet` string is correctly initialized using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Case `n > 52`**: The function correctly handles this case by setting the word to the character at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This is because the smallest possible value for `n` in this case is 53 (which corresponds to 'azz'), and the largest possible value is 78 (which corresponds to 'zzz').
   - **Case `n > 27` and `n <= 52`**: The function correctly handles this case by setting the word to 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` and then 'z'. This is because the smallest possible value for `n` in this case is 28 (which corresponds to 'aaz'), and the largest possible value is 52 (which corresponds to 'azz').
   - **Case `n == 27`**: The function correctly sets the word to 'aay'. This is the only possible word that sums to 27.
   - **Case `3 <= n <= 26`**: The function correctly sets the word to 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This is because the smallest possible value for `n` in this case is 3 (which corresponds to 'aaa'), and the largest possible value is 26 (which corresponds to 'aaz').

4. **Output**: The function prints the decoded word for each test case, which is the correct behavior as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 27.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 3, which should result in 'aaa'.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 78, which should result in 'zzz'.

6. **Lexicographical Order**: The function ensures that the words are lexicographically smallest by always starting with 'a' and incrementing the characters from the end of the word to the beginning, which is the correct approach for this problem.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
