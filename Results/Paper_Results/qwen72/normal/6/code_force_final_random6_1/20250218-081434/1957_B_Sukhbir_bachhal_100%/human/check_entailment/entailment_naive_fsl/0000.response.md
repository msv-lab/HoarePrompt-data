Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `n > 1` and `k` is a power of 2 correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1(k)` returns the highest bit position that is set in `k`, and the program then constructs the sequence by appending `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - arr[-1]`. This approach fails when `k` is a power of 2 because `2 ** counter - 1` will be a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position, and `k - arr[-1]` will be a negative number, which is not a valid non-negative integer.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 8`:
- `func_1(8)` returns 3 because the highest bit position in 8 (binary: 1000) is 3.
- The program then appends `2 ** 3 - 1 = 7` to the array.
- It then appends `8 - 7 = 1` to the array.
- The resulting sequence is `[7, 1]`, which sums to 8, but the bitwise OR of 7 and 1 is 7 (binary: 111), which does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

A correct approach would be to distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 8`, a correct sequence could be `[8, 0]` (binary: 1000 | 0000 = 1000, which has one 1 in its binary representation, which is the maximum possible).
