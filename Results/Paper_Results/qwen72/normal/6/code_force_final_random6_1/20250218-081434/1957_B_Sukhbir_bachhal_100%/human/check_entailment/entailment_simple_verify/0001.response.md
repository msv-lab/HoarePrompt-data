### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k` and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position that is set in `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence. This value is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the sequence. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements is `k`.
     - It appends `0` to the sequence `n-2` times to ensure the sequence has `n` elements.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n)` returns the position of the highest bit set in `n`.
   - It uses a while loop to shift `n` right until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The position is returned as `position - 1` because the bit positions are 0-indexed.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:**
     - When `n > 1`, the sequence is constructed such that the sum of the first two elements is `k`, and the rest are 0. This satisfies the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k\).
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - The value `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`. This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
     - The second element `k - arr[-1]` ensures that the sum is `k` and does not affect the number of 1s in the bitwise OR because it is added to a number with all bits set to 1.
     - The remaining elements are 0, which do not affect the bitwise OR.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (`n == 1`):**
     - The program correctly prints `k` when `n` is 1.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):**
     - The program correctly constructs the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR and ensures the sum is `k`.

### Annotations Validation:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

- **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
  - The function correctly returns the position of the highest bit set in `n`.
  - The state after the function call is that `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (excluding leading zeros).

- **Sequence Construction:**
  - The sequence is constructed correctly:
    - `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
    - `k - arr[-1]` ensures the sum is `k`.
    - The remaining elements are 0, which do not affect the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for both single and multiple elements, ensuring the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
