### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Integer Case (n == 1):**
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k\) when \(n = 1\) is to have \(a_1 = k\).

3. **Multiple Integers Case (n > 1):**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The function `func_1` returns the position of the highest bit set in `k` (0-indexed). For example, if `k = 5` (binary `101`), `func_1(5)` returns 2.
   - The program then constructs an array `arr` with the first element being \(2^{\text{position}} - 1\). This is the largest number with all bits set up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - The second element is `k - arr[0]`, which ensures that the sum of the elements in `arr` is `k`.
   - The remaining elements (if any) are set to 0 to fill the array to length `n`.

4. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in the Bitwise OR:**
   - The first element \(2^{\text{position}} - 1\) is chosen to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the array. This is because \(2^{\text{position}} - 1\) has all bits set up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - The second element `k - arr[0]` ensures that the sum is `k` and does not affect the number of 1s in the bitwise OR because it is added to the first element.
   - The remaining elements being 0 do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the position of the highest bit set in `k` by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0 and counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which is the correct 0-indexed position of the highest bit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements of the problem. It ensures that the sum of the elements is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements.
