The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `position`, but the condition for the loop to execute is solely based on `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is not equal to 0. The state right before the loop indicates that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0. This means that `n` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute, so no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**
