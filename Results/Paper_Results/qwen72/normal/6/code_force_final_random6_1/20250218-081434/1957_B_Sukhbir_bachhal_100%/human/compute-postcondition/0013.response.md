Output State: **`n` is 0; `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (excluding leading zeros).**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0.
- In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`n >>= 1`), which effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the remainder.
- The variable `position` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, counting the number of times the loop has executed.
- The loop will stop when `n` becomes 0, which happens after `position` has been incremented to the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (excluding leading zeros).

For example, if the initial `n` is 16 (binary `10000`), the loop will execute 5 times (since 16 has 5 bits in its binary representation), and `position` will be 5 when the loop finishes. If the initial `n` is 1 (binary `1`), the loop will execute 1 time, and `position` will be 1 when the loop finishes.
