The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer. The value of `position` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (since the initial range was 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and it is now halved), and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**
