You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0; `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (excluding leading zeros).
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and returns the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus one. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of these integers should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position that is set in `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence. This value is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the sequence. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements is `k`.
     - It appends `0` to the sequence `n-2` times to ensure the sequence has `n` elements.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n)` returns the position of the highest bit set in `n`.
   - It uses a while loop to shift `n` right until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The position is returned as `position - 1` because the bit positions are 0-indexed.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:**
     - When `n > 1`, the sequence is constructed such that the sum of the first two elements is `k`, and the rest are 0. This satisfies the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k\).
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - The value `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`. This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
     - The second element `k - arr[-1]` ensures that the sum is `k` and does not affect the number of 1s in the bitwise OR because it is added to a number with all bits set to 1.
     - The remaining elements are 0, which do not affect the bitwise OR.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (`n == 1`):**
     - The program correctly prints `k` when `n` is 1.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):**
     - The program correctly constructs the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR and ensures the sum is `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for both single and multiple elements, ensuring the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
