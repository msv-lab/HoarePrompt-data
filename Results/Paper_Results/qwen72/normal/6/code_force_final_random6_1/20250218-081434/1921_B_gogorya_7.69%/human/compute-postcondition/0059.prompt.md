Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, `res` is incremented by 1. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1` and is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `hd` remains equal to `a1 - a2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 2` and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, `hd` remains equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, `res` is increased by 1 and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` was not greater than 0, or `hd` remains `a1 - a2 - 2` if `hd` was greater than 0. Otherwise, `res` and `hd` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
