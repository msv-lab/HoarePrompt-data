The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `res`, followed by a space. 

Since the initial state specifies that `res` is a list with at least two elements and `i` is the second element in `res`, the output will be the value of the second element in `res`, followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the second element of the list `res`)**
