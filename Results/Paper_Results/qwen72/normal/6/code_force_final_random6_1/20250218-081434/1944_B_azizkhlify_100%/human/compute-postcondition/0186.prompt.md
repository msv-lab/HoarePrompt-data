Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early), `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early), `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is the first element in `res`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early), `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early), `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is the second element in `res`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early), `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early), `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is the third element in `res`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early) and must have at least 3 elements, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early), `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
