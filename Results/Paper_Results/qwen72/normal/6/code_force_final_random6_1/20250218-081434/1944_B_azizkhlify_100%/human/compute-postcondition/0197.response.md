The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Since `i` is now `n + 1`, `2 * n` must be greater than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
