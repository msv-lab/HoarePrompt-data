Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is the next element in `res`.
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
- `res` is a non-empty list with at least one more element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is the next element in the list `res`. Since `res` is non-empty and has at least one more element, `i` will be the next element in the list when the `print` statement is executed.
2. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The code will print the next element in the list `res` followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the next element in the list `res`)**
