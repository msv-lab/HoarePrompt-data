Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`.
- If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is increased by 2 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **Variable `a[i]`**: The value of `a[i]` is the element at index 1 of the list `a`. Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only refer to it as `a[1]`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- Since the exact value of `a[1]` is not provided, we can only describe it as the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
