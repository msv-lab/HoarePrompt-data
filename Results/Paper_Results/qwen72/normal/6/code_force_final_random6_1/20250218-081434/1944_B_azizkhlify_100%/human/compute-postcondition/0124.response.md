Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except `r[a[n] - 1]` which is now 1 and `r[a[i] - 1]` which is now 1, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `a[i]` is out of bounds for the list `a` (which has a length of `n`). However, if we assume that `a` has an element at index `n` (i.e., `a[n]`), then `r[a[n] - 1]` was already 1, and now `r[a[i] - 1]` (which is `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`) is also 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
