Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element in `res`, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated. If `ul != ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` for the last processed `i` is set to 0, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each `a[i]` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2. If `ul == ur`, the loop breaks, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for the last processed `i` is set to 0.***
