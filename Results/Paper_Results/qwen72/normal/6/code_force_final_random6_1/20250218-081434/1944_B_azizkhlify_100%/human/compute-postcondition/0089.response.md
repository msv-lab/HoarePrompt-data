Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `res`, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met. If `ul == ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0 and `ur` is `ur + 2`.***
