Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ul` is increased by 2.
- If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Variable `a[i]`**:
   - `a` is a list, and `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `a`.
   - Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`.

3. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).

### Output:
- The value of `a[1]` will be printed twice, followed by a space.
- Since the exact value of `a[1]` is not provided in the initial state, we will use the placeholder `a[1]`.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
