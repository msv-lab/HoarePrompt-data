Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
2. **`i`**: 1.
3. **`l`**: A list of length `n` where:
   - The element at index `a[0] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2.
   - Each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
4. **`r`**: A list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
5. **`res`**: An empty list.
6. **`ul`**: 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, otherwise 0.
7. **`ur`**: 0.
8. **`re`**: 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.
- The variable `i` is set to 1.
- Therefore, the code will print `a[1]` twice, followed by a space.

### Determining `a[1]`:
- The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer some properties about it.
- The list `a` must be at least of length 2 because `i` is 1 and we are accessing `a[1]`.
- The elements of `a` are used to determine the values in `l` and `r`, but the exact values of `a` are not provided.

### Conclusion:
- Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `a[1]`.
- However, we know that `a[1]` is an element of the list `a` and it will be printed twice followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
