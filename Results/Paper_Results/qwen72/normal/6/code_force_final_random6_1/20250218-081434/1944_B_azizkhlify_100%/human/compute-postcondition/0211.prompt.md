Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing, and all elements in `res` have been printed, one after another, separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged or `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and `ul` equals `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `ul` does not equal `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul == ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `ul == ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
