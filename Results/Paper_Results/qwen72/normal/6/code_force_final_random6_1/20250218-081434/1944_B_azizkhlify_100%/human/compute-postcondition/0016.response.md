The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n - 1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

However, since `i` starts at `n` and the loop condition is `i < 2 * n`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
