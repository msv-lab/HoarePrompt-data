Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` has iterated through all elements in `res`. Additionally, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and if `ul` is equal to `ur` after the update, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
