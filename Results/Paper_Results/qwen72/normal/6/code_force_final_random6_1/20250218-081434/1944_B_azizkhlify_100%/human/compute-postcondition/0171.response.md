Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
4. `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
5. `res` is a list containing the element `a[1]` if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list.
6. `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started.
7. `ur` is 0.
8. `re` is 1 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` is 0.
9. `k` is `2 * k - ul`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that it is a list of integers of length `n` (since `a` is used to index `l` and `r`).
3. **List `l`**: The list `l` is defined such that each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
4. **List `r`**: The list `r` is defined such that each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
5. **List `res`**: The list `res` is defined to contain the element `a[1]` if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains an empty list.
6. **Variable `ul`**: The variable `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started.
7. **Variable `ur`**: The variable `ur` is explicitly given as 0.
8. **Variable `re`**: The variable `re` is 1 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, otherwise it is 0.
9. **Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul`.

### What is Printed:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
- The value of `i` is 2.
- Therefore, the statement will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
