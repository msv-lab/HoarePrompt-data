Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `res` remains unchanged but has a new element `a[2]` appended to it if `l[a[2] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `re` is increased by 1 if `l[a[2] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
