Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input number `n` is not the same as the maximum number in the list of test cases. The `for` loop that calculates the `values` and `sum_values` arrays runs up to `n + 1`, but `n` should be the maximum number in the `numbers` list. This can lead to incorrect results if `n` is smaller than the maximum number in the list of test cases. For example, if the input is:
```
2
12
5
```
The program will calculate the `values` and `sum_values` arrays up to 12, but for the second test case (n=5), it will use the precomputed values up to 12, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to compute the `values` and `sum_values` arrays up to the maximum number in the `numbers` list, and then use these arrays to find the results for each test case.
