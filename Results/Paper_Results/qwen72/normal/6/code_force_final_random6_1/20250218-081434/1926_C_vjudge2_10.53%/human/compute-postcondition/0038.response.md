Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0, `sum_total` is 0**

The code snippet `remainder = int(word[:-1])` changes the value of `remainder` to 1, as `word` is "11" and `word[:-1]` removes the last character, leaving "1". The integer conversion of "1" is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
