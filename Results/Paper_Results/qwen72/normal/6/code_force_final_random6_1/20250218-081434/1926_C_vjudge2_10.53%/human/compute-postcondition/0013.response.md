Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `sum_values` with the same length as `values`, which is `max(numbers) + 1`, and sets all its elements to zero. The initial state of `t`, `numbers`, and `values` remains unchanged.
