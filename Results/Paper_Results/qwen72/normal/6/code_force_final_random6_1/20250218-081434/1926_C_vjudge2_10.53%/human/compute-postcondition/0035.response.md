To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(10, n + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 10
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 10

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 11.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 11.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "10", `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0, `sum_total` is 0**
