### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the list of test case numbers `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. Both lists are initialized with zeros and have a length of `max(numbers) + 1`.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation for 0-9:**
   - The function correctly initializes the `values` and `sum_values` lists for numbers from 0 to 9. This is necessary because the sum of digits for these numbers is simply the number itself.

4. **Sum of Digits Calculation for 10 and Above:**
   - The function iterates from 10 to `n + 1` (where `n` is the largest number in the test cases). For each number `i`, it:
     - Converts the number to a string to easily access the last digit and the remaining digits.
     - Extracts the last digit and the remaining digits.
     - Calculates the sum of the digits for the current number `i` by adding the value of the last digit and the value of the remaining digits.
     - Updates the `sum_values` list with the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to the current number `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the cumulative sum of the values for each test case number in the `numbers` list.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Loop Bound:**
  - The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` should be `for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1):` to ensure that the `values` and `sum_values` lists are correctly populated for all numbers up to the maximum number in the test cases.

- **Incorrect Calculation for `values` and `sum_values`:**
  - The calculation `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` is incorrect. The sum of the digits of a number should be calculated by summing the digits directly, not by using the `values` list in this manner.
  - The correct way to calculate the sum of digits for a number `i` is to sum the digits of `i` directly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, 10):
        values[i] = i
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = last + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program has issues with the loop bound and the calculation of the sum of digits. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
