### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then reads `t` integers, each representing a value of `n`, and stores them in the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively.
   - The size of these lists is `max(numbers) + 1` to ensure they can hold values for the largest `n` in the test cases.

3. **Base Case:**
   - The first 10 values in `values` are set to their respective digits (0 to 9).
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is updated accordingly for the first 10 numbers.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the function calculates the sum of digits using the previously computed values.
   - The sum of digits for a number `i` is calculated by converting `i` to a string, extracting the last digit, and the remainder of the number (all digits except the last one).
   - The sum of digits for `i` is then computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is updated for each `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each `n` in the `numbers` list, the function prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits up to `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum of digits for numbers from 1 to 9 is correctly initialized.
  - For numbers greater than 9, the sum of digits is calculated using the last digit and the remainder, which is a valid approach.
  - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is correctly updated for each number.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The function uses dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for each number, which is efficient.
  - However, the function calculates the sum of digits for all numbers up to the maximum `n` in the test cases, which might be unnecessary if the test cases have different values of `n`.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity of the function is \(O(n)\) for the dynamic programming part, where `n` is the maximum number in the test cases.
  - Given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test and the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the function should be able to handle the input within the time limit.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in terms of logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem. However, it can be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations for each test case.
