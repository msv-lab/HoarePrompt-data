Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 1, `i` is 1, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` (which is 1) to `sum_values[i]` (where `i` is 1). Therefore, `sum_values[1]` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
