You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: t and n, where t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and n is a list of integers where each element represents the largest number for each test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)

    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])

    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `values[10]` is 0, `values[11]` is 0, `values[12]` is 1, `values[13]` is 1, `values[14]` is 2, `values[15]` is 2, `values[16]` is 3, `values[17]` is 3, `values[18]` is 4, `values[19]` is 4, `values[20]` is 5, `values[21]` is 5, `values[22]` is 6, `values[23]` is 6, `values[24]` is 7, `values[25]` is 7, `values[26]` is 8, `values[27]` is 8, `values[28]` is 9, `values[29]` is 9, `sum_values[10]` is 0, `sum_values[11]` is 0, `sum_values[12]` is 1, `sum_values[13]` is 2, `sum_values[14]` is 4, `sum_values[15]` is 6, `sum_values[16]` is 9, `sum_values[17]` is 12, `sum_values[18]` is 16, `sum_values[19]` is 20, `sum_values[20]` is 25, `sum_values[21]` is 30, `sum_values[22]` is 36, `sum_values[23]` is 42, `sum_values[24]` is 49, `sum_values[25]` is 56, `sum_values[26]` is 64, `sum_values[27]` is 72, `sum_values[28]` is 81, `sum_values[29]` is 90, and so on up to `sum_values[n]` is the sum of all `values` from 0 to `n`.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: The list `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers where `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, each integer `n` in `numbers` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The list `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, and the list `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros. The variable `total` remains 45. The variable `i` is `n + 1` where `n` is the last element in `numbers`. The values in `values` and `sum_values` remain unchanged, with `values[10]` to `values[29]` and `sum_values[10]` to `sum_values[29]` as specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `n` (a list of integers where each element represents the largest number for each test case). It returns a list of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding largest number in `n` is even, and `False` if it is odd.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
