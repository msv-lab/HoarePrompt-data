The code snippet `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` extracts the last character of the string `word`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `last`. Given that `word` is "10", the last character is '0', which is converted to the integer 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `word` is "10", `last` is 0.**
