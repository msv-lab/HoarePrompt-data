Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the digit sums of numbers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. Here’s a breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of digits and the cumulative sum of these sums, respectively.
   - The initial values for `values` and `sum_values` up to 9 are correctly set.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - The program iterates from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers` (inclusive) to calculate the sum of digits for each number.
   - The method used to calculate the sum of digits is incorrect. The program converts the number to a string and then extracts the last digit and the remainder of the number. However, the logic for combining these values is flawed:
     - `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` is incorrect because `values[remainder]` should be the sum of the digits of the number formed by the digits except the last one, not the value in the `values` list.
     - The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of digits directly or use a helper function to compute it.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the `sum_values` list to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums.
   - However, due to the incorrect digit sum calculation, the cumulative sum will also be incorrect.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the cumulative sum for each test case, which is correct in structure but incorrect due to the flawed digit sum calculation.

### Corrected Version:
To correct the program, we need to properly calculate the sum of digits for each number. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum_of_digits(i)
        total += values[i]
        sum_values[i] = total
    
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Explanation:
- **sum_of_digits(n):** A helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number `n`.
- **values[i]:** Stores the sum of digits for each number `i`.
- **sum_values[i]:** Stores the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the sum of digits. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
