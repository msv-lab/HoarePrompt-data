Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the initial values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1` or the loop breaks, and the remaining elements are zeros.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` updates the values of `n` and `k` to the integer values of the first and second elements in `l1`, respectively. Since `k0` was initially set to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k` and `k0` now have the same value. The other variables remain unchanged.
