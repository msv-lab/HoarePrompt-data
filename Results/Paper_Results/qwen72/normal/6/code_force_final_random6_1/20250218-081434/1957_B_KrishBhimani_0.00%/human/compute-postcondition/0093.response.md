Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` with zeros.
- The number of zeros added is `n - len(ans)`.
- After this operation, the length of `ans` will be `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
