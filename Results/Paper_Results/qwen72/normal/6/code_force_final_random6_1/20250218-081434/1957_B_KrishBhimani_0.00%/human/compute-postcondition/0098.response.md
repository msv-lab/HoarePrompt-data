Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr` (which is now an empty list), `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = []` initializes `arr` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `c`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Since `arr` is now an empty list, `i` (which was the last element in `arr`) is now undefined or can be considered as `None` in the context of an empty list.
- The conditions for `ans` remain the same, but since `arr` is empty, `ans` will also be an empty list until further iterations or updates are performed.
