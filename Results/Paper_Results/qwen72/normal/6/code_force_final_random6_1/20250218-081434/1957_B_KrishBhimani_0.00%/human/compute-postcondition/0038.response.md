The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least three elements, the loop will execute again for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `arr`, and `arr` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `ans` contains the values `1 << i` and `1 << i`. `c` is increased by 1.**
