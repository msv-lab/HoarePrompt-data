The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop is controlled by the range of `int(input())`, which dictates how many times the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

However, the value of `int(input())` is not something that can be adjusted within the loop; it is determined by the user input before the loop starts. Therefore, we can only adjust `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**
