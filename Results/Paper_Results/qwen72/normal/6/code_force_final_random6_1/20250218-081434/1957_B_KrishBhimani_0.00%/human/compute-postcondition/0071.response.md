Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0.**

The variable `c` is initialized to 0, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.
