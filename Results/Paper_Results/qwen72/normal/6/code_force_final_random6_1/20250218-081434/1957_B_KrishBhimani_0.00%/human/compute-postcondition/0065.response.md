The value `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `arr`. The original `arr` contained either `[0, 1]` if `k0` was an odd number, or `[1]` if `k0` was an even number. After appending `i`, `arr` will contain `[0, 1, 2]` if `k0` was odd, or `[1, 2]` if `k0` was even. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (using integer division) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `k0` was odd, or `[1, 2]` if `k0` was even.**
