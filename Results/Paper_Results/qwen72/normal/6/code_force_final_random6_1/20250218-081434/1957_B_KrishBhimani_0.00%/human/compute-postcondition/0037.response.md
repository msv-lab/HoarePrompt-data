Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` contains the values `1 << i` and `1 << i`. `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value `1 << i` is appended to the list `ans`.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` now contains two elements, both equal to `1 << i`.
