The value of `k` is updated to `k` right-shifted by 1, which is equivalent to integer division by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (using integer division), `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros. If the original `k` (now `k0`) was an odd number, `arr` contains `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `arr` contains `[1]`.**
