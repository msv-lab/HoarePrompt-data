Postcondition: ***`arr` is an empty list if `k` is even, or `arr` contains `[1, 2]` if `k` is odd. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` shifted right by 1 bit and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.***
