Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 2`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`, and `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` is the third element in `arr`.
- `c` is `c + 2`.
- `ans` initially contains an additional element which is `1 << i`.
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends a new element to `ans` which is the result of `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. This means that the new element is `k0` minus the sum of all elements in `ans` except the last one (which is `1 << i`).
- Therefore, `ans` now contains two additional elements: `1 << i` and `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`.
