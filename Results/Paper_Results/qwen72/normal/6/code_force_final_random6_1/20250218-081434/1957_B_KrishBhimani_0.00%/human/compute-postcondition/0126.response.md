Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 1`, if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, a new element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `ans`. `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is `1 << i`, which is a bitwise left shift operation that shifts the number 1 by `i` positions to the left.
- The value of `i` is the first element in `arr`, which is an index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.
- The other conditions and variables (`c` and `n`) remain unchanged, and the program will continue to check if `c` is equal to `n - 1` to decide the next steps.
- The list `ans` now has an additional element, which is `1 << i`.
