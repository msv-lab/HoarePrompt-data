The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `t`, `n`, and `k` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
