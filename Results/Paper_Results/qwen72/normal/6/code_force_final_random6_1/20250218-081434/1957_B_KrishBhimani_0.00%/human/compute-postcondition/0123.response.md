Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` has a new element appended which is equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the execution of the code, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
