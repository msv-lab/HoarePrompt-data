The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will start with `i` equal to 2 and continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. The state of `dp` is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list with two elements, both equal to 1**
