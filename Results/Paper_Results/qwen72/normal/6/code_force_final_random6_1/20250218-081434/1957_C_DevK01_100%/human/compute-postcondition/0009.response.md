Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `dp` is `[7, 25]`**

The code snippet `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. The initial state indicates that `dp` is `[3, 7, 25]`. After executing the code, the first element `3` is removed, leaving `dp` as `[7, 25]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
