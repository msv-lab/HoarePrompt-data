The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the n x n chessboard, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. After executing the function body, the function returns the last value of a sequence generated by a loop, which is stored in the last element of the list `dp`.
