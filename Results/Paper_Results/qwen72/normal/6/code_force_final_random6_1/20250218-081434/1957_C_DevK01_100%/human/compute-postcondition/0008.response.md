The value of `dp` is updated by appending a new element to it. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp[-1]` is 7, `dp[-2]` is 3, and `i` is 4. The calculation is as follows:

1. `dp[-1]` is 7.
2. `dp[-2]` is 3.
3. `i - 1` is 3.
4. `2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` is `2 * 3 * 3` which equals 18.
5. `dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` is `7 + 18` which equals 25.
6. `(7 + 10 ** 9)` is `1000000007`.
7. `25 % 1000000007` is 25.

So, the new element appended to `dp` is 25. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `dp` is `[3, 7, 25]`**
