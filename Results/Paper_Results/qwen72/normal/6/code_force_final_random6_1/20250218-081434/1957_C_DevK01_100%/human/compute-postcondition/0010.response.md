Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`, `dp` is a list with two elements: the last two values of the sequence generated by the loop.**

Natural language description:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from the initial state because the loop does not modify `n`.
- The value of `i` is `n + 1` because the loop iterates from `2` to `n + 1` (inclusive).
- The list `dp` contains the last two values of the sequence generated by the loop. Each new value in the sequence is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, and the first element of `dp` is removed after each iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `dp` will contain the last two values of the sequence.
