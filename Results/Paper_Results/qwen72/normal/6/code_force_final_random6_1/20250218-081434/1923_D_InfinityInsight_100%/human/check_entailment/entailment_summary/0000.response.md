### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a size `a_i`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   - If `x` is found in the list, it returns the index plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the list `a` from left to right.
   - It maintains a list `left` which keeps the cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes up to the current index.
   - It also maintains a list `last` which keeps the index of the last slime with a different size.
   - For each slime at index `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it is immediately eaten, so `ans[i]` is set to 1.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `left[i] - a[i] - 1` and uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` where the cumulative sum `left` is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It then updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx` if `inx` is valid (not less than 0).

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` on the list `a` and its reverse `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results from both directions:
     - If either result is -1, it takes the maximum of the two (which will be -1).
     - Otherwise, it takes the minimum of the two results.

5. **Validation**:
   - The function `func_2` processes the list from left to right and from right to left.
   - By combining the results, it ensures that the minimum time for a slime to be eaten is considered from both directions.
   - The use of `func_1` helps in efficiently finding the first potential eater for a slime, which is crucial for the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or report -1 if it is impossible. The combination of processing from both directions and using `func_1` to find the potential eater ensures that the solution is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
