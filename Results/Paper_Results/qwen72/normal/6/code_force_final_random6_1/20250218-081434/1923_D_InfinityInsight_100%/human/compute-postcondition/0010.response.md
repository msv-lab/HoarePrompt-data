Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, and 2 if \(a[i] \neq a[i - 1]\), otherwise `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, and 2, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` is 2.**
