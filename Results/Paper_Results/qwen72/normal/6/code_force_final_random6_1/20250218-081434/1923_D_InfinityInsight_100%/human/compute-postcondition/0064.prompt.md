Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the cumulative sums of all elements in `a`, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` has been set to each element of `a` during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. The second element of `a` is either less than or not less than the first element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is less than the first element, `ans[1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans[1]` remains unchanged. `x` is set to `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is set to the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is set to `last[0]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, `inx2` is set to `last[0]` and `inx` is also set to `last[0]`, making `inx2` less than or equal to `inx`. If `inx` is less than 0, the loop continues to the next iteration. `ans[1]` is set to `2 - inx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is set to `last[1]`. If `a[2]` is less than `a[1]`, `ans[2]` is 1; otherwise, `ans[2]` remains unchanged. If `inx` is less than 0, the `continue` statement is executed, and no further changes are made to the variables in the current iteration. `ans[2]` is set to `3 - inx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[2]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the `continue` statement is executed, and no further changes are made to the variables in the current iteration. Otherwise, if `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is set to `last[2]`. The values of `ans[2]` and `ans[3]` remain unchanged. `ans[3]` is set to `4 - inx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
