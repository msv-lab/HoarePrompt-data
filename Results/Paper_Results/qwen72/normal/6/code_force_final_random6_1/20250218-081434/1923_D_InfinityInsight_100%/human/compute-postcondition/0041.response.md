The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element at index `i` in the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 in `ans` is now 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans[2]` is 1.**
