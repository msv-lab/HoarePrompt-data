Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` which has been updated based on the conditions within the loop. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1` in the list `a`, if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. If `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains unchanged. The length of `ans` is `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `a`.**
