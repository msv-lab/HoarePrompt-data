You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns 'yes' if `b` is an even number, and 'no' if `b` is an odd number. The value of `a` is not used in the function and has no effect on the return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is about determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged (including rotations) to form a different rectangle. The key is to check if the original rectangle can be transformed into a new one with a different aspect ratio.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if \(b\) is even and 'no' otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - The new rectangle \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) will have a different aspect ratio from the original \(a \times b\) if \(a \neq b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle cannot be cut, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(6 \times 1.5\) rectangles, but since \(b\) is not even, the function correctly returns 'no'.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of checking if \(b\) is even is correct because if \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle and form a new one with a different aspect ratio.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is implemented correctly and handles the edge cases as expected.
