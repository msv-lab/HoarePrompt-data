Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is about determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged (including rotations) to form a different rectangle. The key is to check if the original rectangle can be transformed into a new one with a different aspect ratio.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if \(b\) is even and 'no' otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - The new rectangle \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) will have a different aspect ratio from the original \(a \times b\) if \(a \neq b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle cannot be cut, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(6 \times 1.5\) rectangles, but since \(b\) is not even, the function correctly returns 'no'.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of checking if \(b\) is even is correct because if \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle and form a new one with a different aspect ratio.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is implemented correctly and handles the edge cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
