You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m = m * k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(int(m / k[i]))
    hcf = func_1(c)
    for i in range(n):
        c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
    if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list. The input list `numbers` must contain at least one integer. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the GCD of all elements in `numbers` is returned, and the input list `numbers` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the bets. Specifically, the following issues can be identified:

1. **Multiplication of all `k` values**: The program multiplies all the `k` values together to get `m`. This is not the correct approach for determining the bets. The goal is to find bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, but multiplying all `k` values together can lead to an unnecessarily large `m`, which can cause the sum of bets to be greater than or equal to `m / hcf`.

2. **Incorrect HCF calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the HCF (Greatest Common Divisor) of the list `c`. However, the list `c` is calculated as `m / k[i]`, which is not the correct way to determine the bets. The bets should be determined based on the multipliers `k` in a way that ensures the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Sum check**: The program checks if `sum(c) >= m / hcf` and prints `-1` if this condition is true. However, this check is not always correct because the bets `c` are not calculated correctly in the first place.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be:
```
27 41 12
```
However, the program will calculate:
- `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
- `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
- `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- `m / hcf = 42 / 1 = 42`

Since `sum(c) < m / hcf`, the program will print:
```
14 21 6
```
However, this is incorrect because:
- If the first outcome wins, you receive `3 * 14 = 42` coins.
- If the second outcome wins, you receive `2 * 21 = 42` coins.
- If the third outcome wins, you receive `7 * 6 = 42` coins.

In all cases, the return is equal to the total bet, not strictly greater. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
