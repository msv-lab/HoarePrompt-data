### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, the amount received is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and stores it in \(m\).
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome \(x_i\) as \(m / k_i\).
   - It computes the highest common factor (HCF) of all bets \(x_i\) using the function `func_1`.
   - It reduces each bet by dividing it by the HCF.
   - It checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m / \text{HCF}\). If it is, it prints the reduced bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - The product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\) ensures that each \(x_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
   - The HCF of all \(x_i\) is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m / \text{HCF}\) ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All multipliers are the same:** If all \(k_i\) are the same, the program correctly identifies that no solution exists. For example, if \(k_1 = k_2 = \ldots = k_n = k\), then \(m = k^n\) and \(x_i = k^{n-1}\) for all \(i\). The sum of bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = n \times k^{n-1}\), which is equal to \(m / k = k^{n-1}\). Therefore, the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m / \text{HCF}\) fails, and the program prints \(-1\).
   - **Different multipliers:** For different multipliers, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition. For example, if \(k_1 = 3\), \(k_2 = 2\), and \(k_3 = 7\), then \(m = 3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\). The bets are \(x_1 = 42 / 3 = 14\), \(x_2 = 42 / 2 = 21\), and \(x_3 = 42 / 7 = 6\). The HCF of \([14, 21, 6]\) is 1, so the bets remain \([14, 21, 6]\). The sum of bets is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is less than \(42 / 1 = 42\). Therefore, the program prints \([14, 21, 6]\).

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the HCF of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The function summary is accurate: it returns the HCF of the input list and does not modify the list.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Overflow:** The product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\) can become very large, especially when \(n\) is large. However, since \(k_i\) is constrained to be between 2 and 20, and \(n\) is at most 50, the maximum value of \(m\) is \(20^{50}\), which is within the range of Python's integer type.
   - **Correctness of Bet Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the bets \(x_i\) as \(m / k_i\) and then reduces them by the HCF. This ensures that the bets are the smallest possible values that satisfy the condition.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem statement. It handles the edge cases and ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Final: **True**
