### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the return is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the list of multipliers \(k\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(m\).
   - It then calculates the bets \(c\) as \(m / k_i\) for each outcome \(i\).
   - It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets \(c\) using `func_1`.
   - It normalizes the bets by dividing each by the GCD.
   - It checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than \(m / \text{GCD}\).
   - If the condition is not satisfied, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the normalized bets.

3. **Key Issues:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\) can become very large, especially when \(n\) is large. This can lead to integer overflow or inefficiency.
   - **GCD Calculation:** The GCD calculation is correct, but the normalization step might not always ensure the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).
   - **Condition Check:** The condition check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. The correct condition should be \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i < x_i \times k_i\) for all \(i\).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the bets and normalizing them is flawed. The product \(m\) is not necessary and can lead to large numbers.
   - The correct approach is to find a set of bets \(x_i\) such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. This can be achieved by setting \(x_i = 1\) for all \(i\) and checking if the sum of \(x_i\) is less than \(k_i\) for all \(i\). If not, the program should try to find a suitable set of bets.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - A simpler and more efficient approach is to set \(x_i = 1\) for all \(i\) and check if the sum of \(x_i\) is less than \(k_i\) for all \(i\). If not, the program should try to find a suitable set of bets by incrementing the bets until the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses an inefficient and potentially incorrect method to calculate the bets. The condition check is also flawed.

**Correctness: False**
