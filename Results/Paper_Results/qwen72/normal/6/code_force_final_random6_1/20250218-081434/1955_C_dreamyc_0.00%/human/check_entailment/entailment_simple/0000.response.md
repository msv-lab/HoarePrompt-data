### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is appropriate for efficiently popping elements from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are at least two ships left and `k` is greater than zero.
   - It pops the first and last elements of the deque, `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and reduces both by this amount, also reducing `k` by twice this amount.
   - If `a` or `b` is still positive after the reduction, it is appended back to the deque. If not, the ship is considered sunk, and `ans` is incremented.
   - This loop correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern of alternating between the first and last ships.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the main loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to the remaining durability of this ship, the ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the loop exits because `k` is zero or there are no ships left, the function returns the total number of ships sunk.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero correctly by not performing any further attacks.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to its durability.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a deque ensures that popping elements from both ends is efficient (O(1) time complexity).
   - The loop runs until `k` is zero or there are fewer than two ships left, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
