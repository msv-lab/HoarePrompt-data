### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It converts the list of ship durabilities `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first ship (`a`) and the last ship (`b`) from the deque.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to reduce both ships' durabilities by `x`, it does so and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the left of the deque.
   - If `b` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the right of the deque.
   - If a ship's durability drops to zero, it is not appended back, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.
   - The loop breaks if there are not enough attacks left to reduce both ships' durabilities by `x`.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`), and the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship, the program increments the count of sunk ships by one and returns `ans + 1`.
   - If the loop exits and there are no ships left or the remaining attacks are not sufficient to sink the last ship, it simply returns `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of sunk ships.

### Analysis:
- **Efficiency**:
  - Using a deque allows efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial for the problem's requirements.
  - The while loop ensures that the program only processes ships that are still in the deque, which is correct.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
  - It correctly reduces the durabilities and counts the number of sunk ships.
  - The special case for a single remaining ship is also handled correctly.

### Annotated Code Validation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The state before the function call is accurately described.
- The state after the main loop is accurately described, including the conditions under which the loop breaks.
- The state and logic for the single ship case are also accurately described.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given inputs. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
