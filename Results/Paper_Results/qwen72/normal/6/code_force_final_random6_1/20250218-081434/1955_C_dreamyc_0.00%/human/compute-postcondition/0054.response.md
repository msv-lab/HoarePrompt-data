Output State: **The program returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0.** 

This means that the variable `ans` contains the count of elements that were removed from the deque `nums` during the process, and this count is returned by the program. The exact value of `ans` depends on the initial state and the operations performed on `nums` before the loop condition `while k and len(nums) >= 2` is no longer satisfied.
