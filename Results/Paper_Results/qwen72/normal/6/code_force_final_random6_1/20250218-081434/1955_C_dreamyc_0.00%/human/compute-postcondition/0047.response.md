Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `len(nums)` is at least 1.** 

Explanation:
- The code `nums.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the right of the deque `nums`.
- Since `b` is appended to `nums`, the length of `nums` increases by 1.
- The initial state indicates that `nums` contains `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers. After appending `b`, `nums` will contain `n-3` or `n-2` positive integers.
- The conditions for `a`, `b`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The condition `len(nums)` is at least 1 remains valid as `b` is appended to `nums`.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated length of `nums` and the unchanged values of other variables.
