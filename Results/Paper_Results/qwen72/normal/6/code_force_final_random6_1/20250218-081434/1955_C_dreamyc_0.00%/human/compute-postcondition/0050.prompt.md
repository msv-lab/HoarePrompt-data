Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-2` or `n-1` or `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2, `a` is the first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, `nums` contains `n-1` or `n` positive integers, `ans` is 0 or 1. If `a` > 0, `nums` contains `n` positive integers, `ans` is 0, and if `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `k` < 2 * `x`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` <= 0, `nums` contains `n-1` positive integers, `ans` is 1, and if `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `k` < 2 * `x`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b` <= 0, `nums` contains `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers, `ans` is 1 or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `k` is non-zero, and `len(nums)` is at least 2. If `b` > 0, `nums` contains `n-3` or `n-2` or `n-1` positive integers, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. `b` is appended to the right of `nums`. If `b` is 0, `nums` contains `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-2` positive integers, `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-5` or `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-4` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `len(nums)` is at least 1. If `b` > 0, `nums` contains `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers. If `a` > 0 and `b` > 0, `b` is appended to the right of `nums`. If `a` > 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `a` > 0 and `k` is less than `2 * x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is 0, `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. If `b` is 0, `nums` contains `n-5` or `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers, and `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 6.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
