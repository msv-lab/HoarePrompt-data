You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break

        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):
        return ans + 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0. If the list `nums` ends up containing exactly one positive integer and `k` is greater than or equal to this integer, the function returns the total count of removed elements plus 1. Otherwise, it returns just the total count of removed elements. After the function concludes, `nums` is a deque containing 0 or 1 positive integers, and `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the total cost of removing the minimum elements from `nums` in pairs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks a single remaining ship. Specifically, the condition `if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):` is incorrect because it only checks if the remaining ship can be sunk in one attack. However, the Kraken can attack the ship multiple times if `k` is greater than the remaining durability of the ship.

**Example Case:**

Consider the input:
```
1
2 7
5 2
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
1
```

**Why:**

- The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 5) and the last ship (durability 2) in the first two attacks.
- After the first two attacks, the ships' durabilities are [4, 1].
- The Kraken then attacks the first ship (durability 4) and the last ship (durability 1) in the next two attacks.
- After the next two attacks, the ships' durabilities are [3, 0]. The last ship sinks.
- The Kraken then attacks the first ship (durability 3) three more times.
- After these three attacks, the first ship's durability becomes 0 and it sinks.

The program fails to correctly handle the remaining single ship and does not account for multiple attacks on the same ship when only one ship is left. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
