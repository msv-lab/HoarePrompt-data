### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It converts the list of ship durabilities `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first ship (`a`) and the last ship (`b`) from the deque.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to reduce both ships' durabilities by `x`, it does so and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the left of the deque.
   - If `b` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the right of the deque.
   - If a ship's durability drops to zero, it is not appended back, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`), and the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship, the program increments the count of sunk ships by one and returns `ans + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it simply returns `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of sunk ships.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correct Handling of Alternating Attacks**:
  - The program correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ships by using `popleft` and `pop` on the deque.
  - The `min(a, b)` calculation ensures that the ship with the lower durability is sunk first, which is correct according to the problem statement.

- **Efficiency**:
  - Using a deque for `nums` is efficient for popping from both ends, which is necessary for the alternating attacks.
  - The while loop ensures that the program only processes ships that are still in the deque, which is correct and efficient.

- **Special Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where only one ship remains and the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.
  - The condition `if k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]` ensures that the single remaining ship is sunk if possible, and the count is incremented accordingly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where all ships are sunk before the `k` attacks are exhausted.
  - It also handles the case where no ships are sunk and `k` attacks are insufficient to sink any ship.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given inputs. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
