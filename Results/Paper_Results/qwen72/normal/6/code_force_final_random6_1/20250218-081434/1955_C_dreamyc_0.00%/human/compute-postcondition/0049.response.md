Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-5` or `n-4` or `n-3` or `n-4` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `len(nums)` is at least 1. If `b` > 0, `nums` contains `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers. If `a` > 0 and `b` > 0, `b` is appended to the right of `nums`. If `a` > 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `a` > 0 and `k` is less than `2 * x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is 0, `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. If `b` is 0, `nums` contains `n-5` or `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers, and `ans` is 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 6.**
