Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `perguna` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`. `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. `i` is `-1`. `a` and `b` remain unchanged lists of n integers, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n).**

In natural language, this means:
- `pergunta` will be updated to the smallest value between its original value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all indices `i` that are less than `m`.
- `x` will be the total sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all indices `i` from `n-1` down to `0`.
- The loop counter `i` will be `-1` after the loop has completed all iterations.
- The lists `a` and `b` will remain unchanged.
- The variables `n` and `m` will retain their initial values.
