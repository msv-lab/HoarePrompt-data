Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called but not defined within the program, which will result in a runtime error. Additionally, the logic within the function `func_1` does not accurately reflect the problem description, particularly the way it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. The program does not account for the cost of moving through intermediate positions correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

The expected output is `14`, but the program will not produce this output due to the issues mentioned.
