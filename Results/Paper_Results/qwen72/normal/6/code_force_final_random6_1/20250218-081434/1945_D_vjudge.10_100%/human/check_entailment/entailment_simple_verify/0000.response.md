### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call**:
   - The original assessment mentions that the function `func_1` is called but not defined within the program. However, the provided program does define `func_1` and calls it correctly. Therefore, this part of the assessment is inaccurate.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `x` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bribes.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), which means it processes the queue from the end to the beginning.
   - For each position `i` in the queue, if `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`. This step is intended to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
   - The variable `x` is then incremented by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is intended to account for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` or the people between `i` and the next position Kirill moves to.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic of updating `pergunta` to `min(pergunta, x + a[i])` when `i < m` is correct. It ensures that `pergunta` is the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
   - The logic of incrementing `x` by `min(a[i], b[i])` is also correct. It ensures that the total cost `x` is the minimum cost for Kirill to move through the queue, considering the cost of bribing the person at position `i` or the people between `i` and the next position.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the example provided in the problem description:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       4 2
       7 3 6 9
       4 3 8 5
       ```
     - Expected Output: `14`
     - Step-by-step calculation:
       - Initialize `x = 0` and `pergunta = float('inf')`.
       - Iterate from `i = 3` to `0`:
         - `i = 3`: `x += min(9, 5) = 5`, `pergunta` remains `inf` (since `3 >= 2`).
         - `i = 2`: `x += min(6, 8) = 5 + 6 = 11`, `pergunta = min(inf, 11 + 6) = 17` (since `2 < 2`).
         - `i = 1`: `x += min(3, 3) = 11 + 3 = 14`, `pergunta = min(17, 14 + 3) = 14` (since `1 < 2`).
         - `i = 0`: `x += min(7, 4) = 14 + 4 = 18`, `pergunta` remains `14` (since `0 < 2`).
       - The final value of `pergunta` is `14`, which matches the expected output.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
   - The program iterates through the queue in reverse, ensuring that it considers the cost of moving to each position and the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
   - The program updates `pergunta` to the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people, and it correctly accumulates the total cost in `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described. The original assessment was inaccurate in its criticism of the function definition and the logic for cost calculation. The program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output for the given problem.
