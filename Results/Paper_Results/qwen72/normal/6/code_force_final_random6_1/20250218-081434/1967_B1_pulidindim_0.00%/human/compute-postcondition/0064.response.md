Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + Î£((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k from 2 to m`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `n / m - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers provided by `input().split()`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged, but `g` is recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `m`.
- The condition `if g < countmins` is still checked, and if it is true, the loop breaks.
