Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / 2 - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values.**
