Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`.
- Since `count` is 2, `g` is now equal to `n / 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.
