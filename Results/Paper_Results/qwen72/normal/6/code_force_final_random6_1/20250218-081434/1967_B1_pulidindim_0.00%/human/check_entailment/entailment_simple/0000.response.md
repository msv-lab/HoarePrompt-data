### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Initial Count:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\). This is because for \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\)), and there are \(n\) such pairs \((a, 1)\).

4. **Loop for \(b > 1\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates `countmins` as \(b - 1\).
   - It then calculates \(g\) as \(\frac{n}{b}\).
   - If \(g < \text{countmins}\), the loop breaks because there are no more valid pairs for the current \(b\).
   - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding \(\frac{g - \text{countmins}}{b} + 1\).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Loop:

- **Condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\):**
  - This condition can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
  - Simplifying, we get \(a = (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \cdot b\).
  - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop is designed to count the number of valid pairs for each \(b\).
  - `countmins` is \(b - 1\), which is the minimum value of \(a\) that can be considered for the current \(b\).
  - \(g\) is \(\frac{n}{b}\), which is the maximum number of multiples of \(b\) that can be considered for \(a\).
  - The expression \(\frac{g - \text{countmins}}{b} + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).

### Potential Issues:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `g`:**
  - The program calculates \(g\) as \(\frac{n}{b}\), which is not necessarily an integer. It should be \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\) to ensure it is an integer.
  - This can lead to incorrect results when \(g\) is not an integer.

- **Incorrect Update of `ans`:**
  - The update `ans += g / count + 1` is not correct. It should be `ans += (g - countmins) // b + 1` to ensure integer division and correct counting.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n // count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g // count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has issues with the calculation of `g` and the update of `ans`. These issues can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
