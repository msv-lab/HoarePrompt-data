You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a specific formula and prints the integer value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `t` is the total number of test cases, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, and `ans` is the final calculated value for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is not correct. The number of valid pairs should be initialized to 0, as we are counting pairs that satisfy the condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `g`:**
   - The calculation `g = n / count` and `g -= countmins` is not correct. The variable `g` should represent the number of valid pairs for a given `b`, but the current logic does not correctly compute this.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition `while count <= m` is correct, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The program should iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and count the valid pairs for each `b`.

4. **Incorrect Pair Counting:**
   - The program attempts to count pairs using `ans += g / count + 1`, but this is not the correct way to count valid pairs. The correct approach involves checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

**Example of Incorrect Output:**

For the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

However, the program outputs:
```
4
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
