Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are the new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values. `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.***
