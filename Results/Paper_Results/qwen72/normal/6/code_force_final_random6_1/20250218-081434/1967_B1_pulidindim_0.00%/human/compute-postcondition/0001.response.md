The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function before the loop starts. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
