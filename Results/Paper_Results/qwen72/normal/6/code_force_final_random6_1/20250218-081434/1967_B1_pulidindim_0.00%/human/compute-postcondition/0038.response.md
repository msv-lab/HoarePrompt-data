Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`. Since `count` is 2, `g` is now `n / 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
