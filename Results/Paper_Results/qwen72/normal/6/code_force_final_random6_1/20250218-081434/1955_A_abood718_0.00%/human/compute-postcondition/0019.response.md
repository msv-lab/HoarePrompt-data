Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers input by the user, split by spaces.
   - `X` is equal to `A // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(X * C + B)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The user inputs three integers, `A`, `B`, and `C`, which are split by spaces and assigned to the respective variables.
   - `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2, which means `X` is the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.
   - The expression `X * C + B` is evaluated and printed.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `X` is `A // 2`, the value of `X` is the integer part of `A` divided by 2.
   - The expression `X * C + B` will be the product of `X` and `C` added to `B`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are the integers input by the user)**
