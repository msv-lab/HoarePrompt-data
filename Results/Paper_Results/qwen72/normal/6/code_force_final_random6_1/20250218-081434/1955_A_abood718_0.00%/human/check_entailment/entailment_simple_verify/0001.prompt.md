You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no changes to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means the number of yogurts is even. In this case, the program calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
   - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means the number of yogurts is odd. The program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts `X = A // 2` and then prints the cost of buying `X` pairs at the promotion price plus one additional yogurt at the regular price `X * C + B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case in a separate line.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - The program prints `X` before printing the final cost for the odd case, which is unnecessary and incorrect. This will cause the output to be in the wrong format and include an extra line.
  - The correct output should only be the final cost `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Correctness:
- **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the extra print statement in the odd case.)

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

Correctness: **True** (The corrected program is correct based on the problem description.)
