The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range` loop in Python.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer, which will allow the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` is automatically set to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be explicitly stated.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
