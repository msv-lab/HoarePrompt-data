Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces.** 

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers. The code snippet `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reassigns `A`, `B`, and `C` to the values input by the user, split by spaces. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The conditions regarding `B * 2` and `A` being even or odd are not evaluated in this snippet, so they do not affect the output state.
