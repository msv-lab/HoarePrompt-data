Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are the values input by the user, split by spaces.
   - `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
   - The current value of `A` is even.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `A` is an even integer.
   - `C` is an integer.
   - The expression `A * C / 2` is evaluated and then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
   - Since `A` is even, `A * C` will be an even number, and dividing it by 2 will result in an integer.
   - The `int()` function will convert the result of the division to an integer, which is already an integer because `A` is even.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `A * C / 2` will be an integer.
   - The `int()` function will not change the value because it is already an integer.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer value of `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A is an even integer and C is an integer)**
