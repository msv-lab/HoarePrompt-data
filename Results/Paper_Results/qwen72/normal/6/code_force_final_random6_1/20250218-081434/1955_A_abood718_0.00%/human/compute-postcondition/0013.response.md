The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on whether `i` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. After the loop body, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1 and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are the values input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
