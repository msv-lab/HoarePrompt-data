Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, `X` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `X` remains unchanged. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` remains 2. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are still the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, then `X` is not changed. If `A` is even, `X` is also not changed. If `A` is odd, `X` is updated to the integer division of `A` by 2.
