Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for handling the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd is incorrect. The program prints the result of `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then calculates `X * C + B`, but it should directly print the final result without the intermediate `print(X)` statement.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5 11
```

**Expected Output:**
```
15
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
15
```

The program prints an extra line with the value of `X`, which is not part of the expected output. The correct implementation should directly print the final result without any intermediate prints.
