The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` provided by the user. For each test case, it prints a result based on the following conditions: if `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2` as an integer; if `A` is odd, it prints `X` (where `X` is `A // 2`) and then prints `X * C + B`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are in the state they were last set to within the loop, and `X` is set to `A // 2` if `A` was odd in the last test case.
