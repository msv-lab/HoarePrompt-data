To determine what will be printed by the `print(X)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers input by the user, split by spaces.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, `X` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `A` is even, `X` remains unchanged.
   - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Determine the Value of `X`**:
   - The value of `X` is initially not specified, so we need to determine it based on the conditions.
   - The conditions depend on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` provided by the user.

Let's analyze the conditions step by step:

- **First Condition**: `B * 2 < C`
  - If this condition is true, `X` remains unchanged.
  - If this condition is false, we move to the next condition.

- **Second Condition**: `A` is even
  - If `A` is even, `X` remains unchanged.
  - If `A` is odd, we move to the next condition.

- **Third Condition**: `A` is odd
  - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Since the initial value of `X` is not specified, we need to consider the possible outcomes based on the user input:

- If `B * 2 < C` is true, `X` remains unchanged (initially undefined).
- If `B * 2 < C` is false and `A` is even, `X` remains unchanged (initially undefined).
- If `B * 2 < C` is false and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `X` will be:
- **Undefined** if `B * 2 < C` is true or if `A` is even.
- **`A // 2`** if `A` is odd and `B * 2 < C` is false.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `X` based on the given conditions.

Output: **X (where X is `A // 2` if `A` is odd and `B * 2 < C` is false, otherwise X is undefined)**
