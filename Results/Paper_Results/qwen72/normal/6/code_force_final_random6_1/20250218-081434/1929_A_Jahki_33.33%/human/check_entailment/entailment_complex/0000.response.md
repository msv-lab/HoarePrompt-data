### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.
   - The array elements are parsed correctly into a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than the previous element.
   - If `order` is 0, it means the array is strictly increasing, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - If `func_1(a, num2)` returns `True`, the program prints 0 because a strictly increasing array has a beauty of 0 (since \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) is always positive and the sum of these differences is maximized by sorting the array in descending order).
   - If `func_1(a, num2)` returns `False`, the program calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array `a` in ascending order and then summing the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\) from 2 to `num2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated maximum beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `num2` in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` should iterate up to `len(a) - 1` instead of `num2 - 1` because `num2` is the length of the array, and the loop should run up to the second-to-last element of the array.
  - This issue can lead to incorrect results if `num2` is not equal to `len(a)`.

- **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Beauty:**
  - The maximum beauty is obtained by sorting the array in descending order, not ascending order.
  - The current implementation sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of differences, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a, reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x - 1] - b[x]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):  # Corrected loop range
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if (order == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program is not corrected.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues in the function `func_1` and the main logic for calculating the maximum beauty.
