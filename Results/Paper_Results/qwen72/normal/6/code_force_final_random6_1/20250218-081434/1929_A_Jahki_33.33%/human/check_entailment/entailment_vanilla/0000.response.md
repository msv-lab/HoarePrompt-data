### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.

2. **Array Validation**:
   - The program uses a list comprehension to convert the input string into a list of integers `a`.
   - It then checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the array `a` and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the program prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array is zero.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

- **Beauty Calculation**:
  - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last.
  - Sorting the array in non-decreasing order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is not the optimal approach for maximizing the beauty.
  - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-increasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the largest elements are placed first and the smallest elements are placed last.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it sorts the array in non-decreasing order, which minimizes the beauty, instead of sorting it in non-increasing order to maximize the beauty.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
