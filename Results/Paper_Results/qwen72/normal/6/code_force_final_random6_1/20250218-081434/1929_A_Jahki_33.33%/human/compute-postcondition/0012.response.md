Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer such that 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is `num2 - 1`, and `order` is the count of indices `j` (0 <= j < num2 - 1) where `a[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[j + 1]`. The current value of `order` is 0, meaning that for all indices `j` (0 <= j < num2 - 1), `a[j]` is less than `a[j + 1]`.**
