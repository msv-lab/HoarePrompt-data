Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are the same. According to the problem description, if all elements in the array are the same, the maximum beauty should be 0. However, the program incorrectly prints 0 for any sorted array, not just arrays with all elements being the same. For example, for the input:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

The program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3, as the beauty of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] is (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3. The function `func_1` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
