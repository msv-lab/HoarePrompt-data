To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `num2` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `order` is 1 if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`.
- `order` is 2 if `a[1]` is greater than or equal to `a[2]`.
- Otherwise, `order` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, num2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `num2`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num2`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 2.
- `num2` is greater than 2.

### Next Iteration:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 3.
- `num2` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, then `order` is 1. If `a[1]` is greater than or equal to `a[2]`, then `order` is 2; otherwise, `order` is 1.**
