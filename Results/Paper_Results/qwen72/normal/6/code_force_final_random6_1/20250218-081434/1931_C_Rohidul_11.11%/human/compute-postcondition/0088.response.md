To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `r > l`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `n - 2` and `r` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, and `l` must be less than `r`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `r` must still be greater than `l`.

2. **Condition 2: `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `a[r]` must still be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`r` and `l`** are the variables in the loop head.
- **`r`** must remain greater than `l` for the loop to execute again.
- **`a[r]`** must still be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`.
- `r` is `n - 2` and `r` must be greater than 0.
- `end` is `end + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The condition `r > l` must still hold true, so `r` must be greater than `l`.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must still hold true, so `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Since the conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` were true at the end of the previous iteration, and no information suggests that these conditions will change, we can simply repeat the program state.

State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 2` and `r` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end + 1`**
