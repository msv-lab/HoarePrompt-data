Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `r` from `n - 1` down to `l + 1`, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `l`, `st` is `l`, `end` is `n - l - 1`, and `l` must be less than `n - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the current element `a[r]` is equal to the previous element `a[r - 1]`.
- Each time the loop executes, `r` is decremented by 1, and `end` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will stop when `r` is no longer greater than `l` or when `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- After all iterations, `r` will be equal to `l`, meaning that the loop has checked all elements from `n - 1` down to `l + 1` and found them to be equal.
- The variable `end` will be equal to `n - l - 1`, which represents the number of elements from the end of the list that were equal to their previous elements.
- The initial state of `st` remains `l`, and `n` remains a positive integer between 2 and 10^4.
