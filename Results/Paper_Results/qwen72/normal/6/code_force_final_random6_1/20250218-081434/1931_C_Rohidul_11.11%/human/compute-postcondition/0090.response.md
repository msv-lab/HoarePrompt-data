Output State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 3` and `r` must be greater than -1, `end` is `end + 2`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `end` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially `end + 1`, it is now `end + 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
