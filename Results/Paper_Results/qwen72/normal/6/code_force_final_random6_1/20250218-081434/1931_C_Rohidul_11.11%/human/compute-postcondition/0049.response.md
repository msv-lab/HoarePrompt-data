Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[l-1]` must be equal to `a[l]` for all `l` from 0 to the final value of `l-1`, `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `l` will be the smallest index where `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]`, or it will be equal to `r` if all elements from the start up to `r-1` are equal. The variable `st` will have the same value as `l`, and `end`, `ans`, and `n` will remain unchanged. The list `a` will also remain unchanged.
