Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0, `st` is 1, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l`. Additionally, the first element of `a` must be equal to the second element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so `st` is now 1.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `end` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `r - l` because `st` is no longer 0 and `end` is still 0.
- The condition that the first element of `a` must be equal to the second element of `a` remains valid.
