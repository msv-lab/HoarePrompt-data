Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[l-1]` must be equal to `a[l]` for all `l` from 0 to the final value of `l-1`, `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 3` and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, changing it from `n - 2` to `n - 3`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
