Output State: **After all iterations, `_` is the total number of test cases processed, `n` is the last input integer for the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal to the element after them, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and the calculated answer based on the conditions: if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` will be the total number of test cases processed, which is the value of `t` provided initially.
- `n` will be the last input integer for the number of elements in the list `a` for the final test case.
- `a` will be the last list of integers provided by the user for the final test case.
- `l` will be the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, or it will be `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal.
- `r` will be the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, or it will be `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal.
- `st` will be the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal to the element after them.
- `end` will be the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them.
- `ans` will be the maximum of 0 and the calculated answer based on the following conditions:
  - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
  - If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
  - In all other cases, `ans` is `r - l`.
