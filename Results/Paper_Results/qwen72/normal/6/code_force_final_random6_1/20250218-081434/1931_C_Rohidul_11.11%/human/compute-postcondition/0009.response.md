Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0.**

The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
