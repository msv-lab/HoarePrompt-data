Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`, `a[1] == a[2]`, and `a[2] == a[3]`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 0**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
