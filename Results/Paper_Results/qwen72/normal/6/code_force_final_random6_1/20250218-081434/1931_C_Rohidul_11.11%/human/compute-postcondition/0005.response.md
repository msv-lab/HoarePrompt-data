To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

1. **Condition `l < r`:**
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `r` will be at least 0 (when `n` is 1) and at most 10^4 - 1 (when `n` is 10^4).
   - For `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`:**
   - Right before the loop, `l` is 0, so we need to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - This condition depends on the values in the list `a`, and we cannot modify the list itself. However, we can ensure that the condition is met by adjusting the state of `a` if necessary.

Given these conditions, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `a[0] == a[1]`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**
