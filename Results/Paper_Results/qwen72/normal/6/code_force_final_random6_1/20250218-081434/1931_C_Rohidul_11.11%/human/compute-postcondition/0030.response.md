Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `r` from `n - 1` down to `l + 1`, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `l`, `st` is `l`, `end` is `n - l - 1`, and `l` must be less than `n - 1`. Additionally, the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. It is not the case that `st == 0` and `end == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]`.**
