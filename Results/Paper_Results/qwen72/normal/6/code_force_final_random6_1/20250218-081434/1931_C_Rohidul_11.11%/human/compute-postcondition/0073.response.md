Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**
