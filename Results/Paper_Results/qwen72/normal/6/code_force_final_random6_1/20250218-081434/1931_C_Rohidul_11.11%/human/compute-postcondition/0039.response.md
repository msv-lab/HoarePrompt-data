Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns `0` to both `st` and `end`. Since `st` and `end` were both initially `0`, the condition `st == 0` and `end == 0` is still true. However, the value of `ans` is determined by the initial conditions, and since `st` and `end` are both `0`, `ans` is set to `0` regardless of whether `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]` or not. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `_`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and the updated values of `st`, `end`, and `ans`.
