To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

### Current State:
- `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`.
- `r` is `n - 3` and `r` must be greater than -1.
- `end` is `end + 2`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `r > l` must be true for the loop to execute again.
- The loop condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also be true for the loop to execute again.

### Adjustments:
- **`r`**: Since `r` is `n - 3` and must be greater than -1, for the loop to execute again, `r` must still be greater than `l`. If `r` is `n - 3`, and `l` is less than `r`, then `l` must be less than `n - 3`.
- **`l`**: `l` must be less than `r` for the loop to execute again. Since `r` is `n - 3`, `l` must be less than `n - 3`.
- **`a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`**: For the loop to execute again, `a[r]` must still be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `r` and `l` must be maintained such that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for the loop to execute again.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 3` and `r` must be greater than -1, `end` is `end + 2`**
