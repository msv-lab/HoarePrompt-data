Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` is set to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is set to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 and `ans` is updated to 1. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` and `ans` is updated to 1. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
