Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi` if `a[r]` is not 0, or `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi` and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` is not 0, or 2, 3, 4, or 5 if `a[r]` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3. In both cases, `l` must be less than `r`.***
