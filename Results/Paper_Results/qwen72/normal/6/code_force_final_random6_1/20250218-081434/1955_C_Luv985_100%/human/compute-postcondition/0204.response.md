Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= n, `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r < n, `ans` is an integer such that 0 <= ans <= n. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
