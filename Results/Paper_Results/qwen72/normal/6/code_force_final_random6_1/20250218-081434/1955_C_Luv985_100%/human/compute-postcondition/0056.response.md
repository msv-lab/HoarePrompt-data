Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` == 0, then `l` is now 1 and `ans` is now 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3.***
