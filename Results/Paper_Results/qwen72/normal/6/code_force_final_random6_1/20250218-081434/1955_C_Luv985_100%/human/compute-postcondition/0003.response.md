Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`.** 

The value of `T` is decremented by 1, but it remains non-zero. All other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
