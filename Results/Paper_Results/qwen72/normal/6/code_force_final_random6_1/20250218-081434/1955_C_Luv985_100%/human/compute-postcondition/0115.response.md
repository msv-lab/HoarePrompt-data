The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional statement it is inside. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement.

Output State: **`t` is `k % 2`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 or 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
