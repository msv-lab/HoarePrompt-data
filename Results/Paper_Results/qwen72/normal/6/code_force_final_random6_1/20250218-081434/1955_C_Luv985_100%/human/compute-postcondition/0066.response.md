Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is an integer such that 0 <= l <= n - 1, `r` is an integer such that 0 <= r <= n - 1, `ans` is an integer such that 0 <= ans <= n, the loop has terminated, and `l` is equal to `r`.**
