Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer and has been decreased by 2 * `mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is 2, 3, or 4.**
