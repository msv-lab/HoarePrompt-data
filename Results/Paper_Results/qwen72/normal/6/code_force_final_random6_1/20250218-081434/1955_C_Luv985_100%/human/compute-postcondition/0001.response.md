Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `T` is an input integer.**

The value of `T` is now an integer provided by the input, while the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged and still adhere to their initial constraints.
