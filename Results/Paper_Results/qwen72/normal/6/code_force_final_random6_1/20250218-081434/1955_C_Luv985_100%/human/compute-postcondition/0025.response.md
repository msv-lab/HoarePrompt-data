Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is now `n - 2`, `ans` is now 1, and `a[n-1]` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.***
