Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
