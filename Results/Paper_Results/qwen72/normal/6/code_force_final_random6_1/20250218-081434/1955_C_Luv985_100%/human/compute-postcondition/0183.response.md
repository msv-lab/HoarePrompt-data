Output State: **`t` is `k % 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
