Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`. Additionally, the value of `a[l]` (which is `a[0]`) minus `t` minus the integer division of `k` by 2 equals 0.**
