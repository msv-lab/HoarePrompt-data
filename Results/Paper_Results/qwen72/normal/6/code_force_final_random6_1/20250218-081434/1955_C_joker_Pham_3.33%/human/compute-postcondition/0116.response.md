Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - a[l-1] * 2`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` after this update, `sunks` is increased by 1 again. If `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, and `sunks` retain their values or updated values as described, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
