Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to n - 2 or n - 3, and `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3. If `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
