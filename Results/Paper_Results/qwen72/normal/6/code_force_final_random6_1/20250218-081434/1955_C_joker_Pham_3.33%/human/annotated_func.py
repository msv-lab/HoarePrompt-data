    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` and `r` such that `l` is greater than `r`, `k` is reduced to a value that is less than twice the value of the smallest remaining element in the list `a` (or 0 if all elements have been processed), and `sunks` is the total number of elements that have been fully processed (i.e., their value has been reduced to 0) or partially processed (i.e., their value has been reduced but not to 0) by the loop.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of elements that have been fully processed (i.e., their value has been reduced to 0) or partially processed (i.e., their value has been reduced but not to 0) by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer representing the reduction value), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the elements of the list `a` by reducing their values using the reduction value `k`. The function returns the total number of elements that have been either fully processed (reduced to 0) or partially processed (reduced but not to 0) by the loop. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced to a value that is less than twice the value of the smallest remaining element in the list `a` (or 0 if all elements have been processed), and the list `a` may have some elements with reduced values, including some that may be 0.
