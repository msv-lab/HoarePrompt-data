Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `k` is now equal to `k - a[l] * 2`. `a[r]` is now equal to `a[r] - a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a[r] -= a[l]` updates the value of `a[r]` by subtracting `a[l]` from it. The other conditions and variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, `a[r]` is now equal to `a[r] - a[l]`, while `l` is still less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is still increased by 1 if `l` equals `r`, and `k` is still equal to `k - a[l] * 2`.
