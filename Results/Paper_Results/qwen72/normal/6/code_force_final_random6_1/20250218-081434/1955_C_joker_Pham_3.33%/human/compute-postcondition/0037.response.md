Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 0 or 1. The condition `a[r] < a[l]` is true. `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.**
