Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 1, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, and the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[l]`.**
