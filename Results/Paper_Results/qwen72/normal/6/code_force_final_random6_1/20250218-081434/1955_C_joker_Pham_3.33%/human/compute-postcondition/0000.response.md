Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged and retain their initial values and constraints.
