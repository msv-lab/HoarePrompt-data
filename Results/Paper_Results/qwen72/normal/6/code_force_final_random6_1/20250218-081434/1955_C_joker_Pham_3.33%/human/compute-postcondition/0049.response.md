Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `a[r] < a[l]` is true, `k` is less than twice the value of `a[r]`, `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2 - 1`, `sunks` is 2.** 

The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
