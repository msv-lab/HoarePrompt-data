Output State: **`l` is now `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, if `l` equals `r` then `sunks` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `k` is now `k - a[l-1] * 2`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l-1]`, if `a[r]` was 0 then `sunks` is increased by 1 again and `r` is now `r - 1`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`.**
