The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is within. The values of the variables `l`, `r`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` are not changed by the `break` statement itself, but the state of being inside a loop or conditional block is affected.

Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` retains its original value, `a` retains its original values, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1 again, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
