Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is 0 or 1, `a[l]` is now 0 or a positive integer less than `a[r]` before the subtraction. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is now 1 or 2, `sunks` is now 1, and `a[r]` must be 0 or a positive integer less than `a[l]` before the subtraction.***
