Postcondition: ***`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is now `l + 1` and `sunks` is now `sunks + 2`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `k < a[r] * 2`, and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1 again, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, and `sunks` retain their values or updated values as described. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - a[l-1] * 2`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` after this update, `sunks` is increased by 1 again. If `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `l` and `r` retain their original values, and `sunks` is unchanged.***
