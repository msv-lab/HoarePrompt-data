Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, and `r` is n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `r` is set to `n - 2` or `n - 3` (if `a[r]` becomes 0), and `sunks` is set to 1. If `a[l]` is 0 after the update, then `l` is set to 1 or 2, `sunks` is set to 2, and `a[r]` must be 0 or a positive integer less than `a[l]` before the subtraction. If `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, then `a[r] < a[l]` remains true, and if `2 * a[r] - 1 == k`, `sunks` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `k` is less than twice the value of `a[r]` after the if-else block executes. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: If `a[r] < a[l]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` also remain unchanged. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= 2 * a[l]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is updated to n - 2 or n - 3, and `sunks` is 2, 3, or 4. If `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < 2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] <= a[r]` and none of the above conditions are met, `sunks` remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k >= a[r] * 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is now `l + 1` and `sunks` is now `sunks + 2`. If `k < a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1 again, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, and `sunks` retain their values or updated values as described. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - a[l-1] * 2`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` after this update, `sunks` is increased by 1 again. If `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `l` and `r` retain their original values, and `sunks` is unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
