Postcondition: ***`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `l` and `r` retain their original values, and `sunks` is unchanged.***
