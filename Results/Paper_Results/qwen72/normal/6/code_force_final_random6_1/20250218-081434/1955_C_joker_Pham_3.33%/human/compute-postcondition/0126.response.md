The code snippet `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. The values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `k` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` retains its original value, `a` retains its original values, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` is increased by 1 again.**
