Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list), `k` (a positive integer representing the reduction value), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). The function returns the total number of elements in the list `a` that have been either fully processed (reduced to 0) or partially processed (reduced but not to 0) by the loop.**
