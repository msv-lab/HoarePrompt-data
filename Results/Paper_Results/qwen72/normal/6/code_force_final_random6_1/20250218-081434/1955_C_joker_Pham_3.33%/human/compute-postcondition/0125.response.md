Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is now `l + 1` and `sunks` is now `sunks + 2`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
