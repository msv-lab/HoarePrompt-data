Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Attacks**:
   - The program attempts to handle attacks in pairs (first and last ship) but does not correctly account for the alternating nature of the attacks.
   - The logic for reducing the durability of the ships and checking if they sink is flawed. It does not properly simulate the sequence of attacks as described in the problem.

2. **Incorrect Break Conditions**:
   - The program has multiple break conditions that are not necessary and can lead to premature termination of the loop.
   - The condition `if k == 0: break` is repeated multiple times, which is redundant and can cause the loop to exit early.

3. **Incorrect Durability Reduction**:
   - The program incorrectly reduces the durability of the ships. For example, it subtracts `a[l] * 2` from `k` and `a[r]` from `a[l]` in some cases, which does not match the problem's description of alternating attacks.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should simulate the Kraken's attacks in a loop, alternating between the first and last ship, and keep track of the number of ships that sink. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while k > 0 and l <= r:
        if a[l] > 0:
            a[l] -= 1
            k -= 1
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
        if k > 0 and l <= r:
            if a[r] > 0:
                a[r] -= 1
                k -= 1
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
    return sunks

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: `l` and `r` are initialized to the first and last indices of the list `a`, respectively. `sunks` is initialized to 0 to count the number of sunk ships.
- **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are still ships to attack (`l <= r`).
  - **First Ship Attack**: If the first ship has non-zero durability, it is attacked, and `k` is decremented. If the first ship's durability reaches 0, it is sunk, and `l` is incremented.
  - **Last Ship Attack**: If there are still attacks left and the last ship has non-zero durability, it is attacked, and `k` is decremented. If the last ship's durability reaches 0, it is sunk, and `r` is decremented.
- **Return**: The function returns the number of sunk ships.

This corrected program accurately simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships as required by the problem description.
