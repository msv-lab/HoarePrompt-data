### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. This matches the problem description, which implies that the function should handle multiple test cases.

2. **Condition for `n == 2`**:
   - If `n` is 2, the function checks if the string `s` is '00'. If it is, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - This logic is correct because for `n == 2`, the only valid string is '00' to satisfy the condition for 'YES'.

3. **Condition for `n != 2`**:
   - The function counts the number of '1's in the string `s` using `s.count('1')`.
   - If the count of '1's is odd, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because an odd number of '1's cannot be split into two equal parts.
   - If the count of '1's is even, the function checks if the substring '11' appears exactly once in `s`. If it does, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
   - This logic is correct because if '11' appears exactly once, it means the string cannot be split into two equal parts without breaking the '11' sequence.

4. **Loop Termination**: The function decrements `t` by 1 after processing each test case and continues until `t` is 0. This ensures that all test cases are processed.

5. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described above, which matches the expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
