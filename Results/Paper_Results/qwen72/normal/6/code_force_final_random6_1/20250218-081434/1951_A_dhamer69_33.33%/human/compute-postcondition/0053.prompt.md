You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        if n == 2:
            if s == '00':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            count_1 = s.count('1')
            if count_1 % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
            elif s.count('11') == 1:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the state of `s` and the other variables remains unchanged. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` remains odd. If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` remains even. Additionally, if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, both of which are integers with the constraint that 0 <= start <= end. It returns a value based on the relationship between `start` and `end`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
