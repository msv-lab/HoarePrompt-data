Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program executes the if part, and the state of `s` and the other variables remains unchanged. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` is odd. If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` is even. Additionally, if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.**
