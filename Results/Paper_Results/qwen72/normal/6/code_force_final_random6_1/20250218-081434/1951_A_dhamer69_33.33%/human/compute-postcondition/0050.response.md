The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `t` was initially `t - 2` and must be greater than 2, after decrementing by 1, `t` is now `t - 3` and must still be greater than 1.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 3` and `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the state of `s` and the other variables remains unchanged. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` remains odd. If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` remains even. Additionally, if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.**
