Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end}\).
   - `t` is defined as `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`.
   - If `count_1` is odd, the current value of `count_1` is odd.
   - If `count_1` is even, the current value of `count_1` is even.
   - If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is retained.
   - Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides several conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is always 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
