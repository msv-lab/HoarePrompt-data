Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and `l` is an input string. If `len(lst) != 2`, `lst` is a list with one less element, and the first element of `lst` is now the second element from the initial state, with the third element from the initial state removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
