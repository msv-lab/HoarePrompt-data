Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n-1 integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element from the list `a` (since `0 * 2` is 0).
- The list `a` initially contains 2n integers, and after removing the first element, it now contains 2n - 1 integers.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `ans_f`, and the updated value of `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
