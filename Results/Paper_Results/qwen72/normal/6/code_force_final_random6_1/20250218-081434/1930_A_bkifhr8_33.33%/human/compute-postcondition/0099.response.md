Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` has iterated through all elements of `ans_f`, `ans_f` contains `n` elements, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` has taken on the value of each element in `ans_f` as the loop iterates through the list.
- The list `ans_f` contains `n` elements, which means the loop has executed `n` times, once for each element in `ans_f`.
- The variable `lst` remains unchanged and is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements for each iteration, as it is not modified within the loop.
