Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the logic for selecting and removing pairs of integers from the list. Specifically, the following issues can be identified:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection and Removal**:
   - The program attempts to select and remove pairs of integers by using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This logic is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always be 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the current state of the list. This means that the program will not correctly remove the first two elements of the list in each iteration.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not appropriate. The loop should continue until the list is empty, not just until it has two elements. The correct condition should be `while len(lst) > 0:`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of the Last Pair**:
   - The program has a special case for when the list has exactly two elements left, but it should handle this case within the main loop to ensure consistency.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input().split()
        lst = [int(x) for x in l]
        lst.sort()
        ans = 0
        for _ in range(n):
            ans += lst.pop(0)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version sorts the list and then repeatedly removes the smallest element (which is the minimum of the remaining pairs) and adds it to the score. This ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved by always selecting the smallest available number.
