Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
