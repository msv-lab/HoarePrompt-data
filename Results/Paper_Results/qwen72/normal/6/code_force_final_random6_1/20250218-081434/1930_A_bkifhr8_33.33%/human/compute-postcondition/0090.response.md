Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2n, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 2n + 1.
- The loop index `i` reaches 2n, which is the end of the loop.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.
- The list `a` remains a list of 2n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^7.
- The variable `ans_f` still contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements.
- The list `lst` is either empty (if the original length was even and greater than 2) or contains 2 elements (if the original length was odd or exactly 2).
