The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain such that `2 * n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `l` is an input string.**
