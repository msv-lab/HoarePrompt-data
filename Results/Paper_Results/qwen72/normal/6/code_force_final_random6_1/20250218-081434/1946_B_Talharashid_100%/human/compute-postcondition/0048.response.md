The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `c` or `maxi`. Therefore, the value of `maxi` will be updated based on the comparison between `c` and `maxi`, but without specific values, we cannot determine the exact new value of `maxi`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
