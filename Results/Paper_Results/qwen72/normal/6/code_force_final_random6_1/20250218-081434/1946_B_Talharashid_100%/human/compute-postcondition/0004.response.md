Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

The variable `maxi` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
