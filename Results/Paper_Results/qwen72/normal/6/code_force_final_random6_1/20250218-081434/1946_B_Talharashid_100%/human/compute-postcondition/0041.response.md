To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `l`, and `ele` is the current element being processed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element
- `ele` is the first element in the list `l`
- `c` is 0
- `maxi` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `ele` must be the second element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, and `ele` is the second element in the list `l`.**
