Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution, the input for the loop range must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and assigns it to the variable `l`.
- The initial state variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` are not affected by this code.
- The precondition that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, and that the input for the loop range must be greater than 1, remains valid.
- The list `l` is now updated to the list of integers provided by the user.
