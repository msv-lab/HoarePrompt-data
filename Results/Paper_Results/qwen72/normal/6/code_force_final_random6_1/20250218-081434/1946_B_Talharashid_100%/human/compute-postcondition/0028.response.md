The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we will refer to as `n` for simplicity. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum, and `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`**.
