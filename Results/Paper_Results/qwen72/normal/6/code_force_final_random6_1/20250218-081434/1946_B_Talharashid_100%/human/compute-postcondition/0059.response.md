Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution, the input for the loop range must be greater than 1.**

The code snippet `c = 0` resets the variable `c` to 0. The other variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. The precondition that the input for the loop range must be greater than 1 is still valid.
