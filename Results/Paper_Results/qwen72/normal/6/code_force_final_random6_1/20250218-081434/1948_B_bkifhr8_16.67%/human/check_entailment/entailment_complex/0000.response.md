### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order and greater than 10.
   - If such an element is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the correct positions.
   - However, the program only performs this operation once for each element, which is insufficient. The operation needs to be applied repeatedly until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - This part of the program is correct and works as intended.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The main issue is that the program does not handle the repeated application of the operation. It only checks and splits elements once, which is not enough to ensure the array can be sorted.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it will not split `28` into `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which is necessary to make the array sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the repeated application of the operation, which is necessary to ensure the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Correctness: **False**
