Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `q2` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged except for the update to `k` which depends on the value of `a[q2]` and `m`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 is still valid.
