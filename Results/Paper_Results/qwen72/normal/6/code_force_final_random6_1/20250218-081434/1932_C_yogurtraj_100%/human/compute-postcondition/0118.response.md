Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is `q2 + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is `q1 - 1`. `y[i]` is `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `n - 3`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is incremented by 1, making `q2` equal to `q2 + 1`.
- If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is decremented by 1, making `q1` equal to `q1 - 1`.
- `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k` after the update.
