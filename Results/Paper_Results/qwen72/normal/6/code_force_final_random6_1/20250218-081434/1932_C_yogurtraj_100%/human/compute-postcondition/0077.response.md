The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer `n`. The loop iterates backward from `n - 2` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` will be `n - 4` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `n - 4` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers initialized to 0 with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y[i]` is set to `k`.**
