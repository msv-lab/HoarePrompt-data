Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is now `a[l - 1] % m`), `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is 0, `i` is -1, and `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`.**
