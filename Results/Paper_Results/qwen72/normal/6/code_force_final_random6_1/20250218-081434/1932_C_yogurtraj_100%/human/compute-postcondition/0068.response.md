Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers initialized to 0 with the last element set to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` or `l - 1` depending on the last character of `t`, and `q2` is `l + 1` or `l + 2` depending on the last character of `t`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`.**
