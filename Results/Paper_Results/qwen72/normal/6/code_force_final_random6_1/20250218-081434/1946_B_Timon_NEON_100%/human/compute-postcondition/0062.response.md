Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least one element, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is equal to `segment`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`.
- `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`, which is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found.
- The states of `arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.
- `total_max_segment` now holds the value of `segment`, which is a segment from `segments_variants`.
