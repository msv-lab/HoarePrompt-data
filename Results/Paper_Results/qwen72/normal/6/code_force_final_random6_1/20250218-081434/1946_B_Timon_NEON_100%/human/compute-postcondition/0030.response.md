Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` remains [arr[0], 0] and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0], 0, 0]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` contains one element which is `new_segment` + [0].**
