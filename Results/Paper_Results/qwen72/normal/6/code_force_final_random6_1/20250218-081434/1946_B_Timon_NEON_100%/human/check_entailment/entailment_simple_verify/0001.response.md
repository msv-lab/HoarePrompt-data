### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function correctly returns the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is essential for the problem and is implemented correctly.
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, it has several issues:
     - **Handling of Negative Arrays:** The function does not correctly handle arrays where all elements are negative. It should return the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which in this case would be zero (an empty subarray).
     - **Updating Segments:** The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all scenarios. Specifically, it should reset `new_segment` when a negative number is encountered and should correctly handle the transition from positive to negative and vice versa.
     - **Appending Last Segment:** The function does not correctly append the last segment if it is positive. This can lead to missing the maximum sum segment.
     - **Returning Negative Sum:** The function returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is incorrect. It should return a segment with a sum of zero in such cases.
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer but is not implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can add it `k` times to the array.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero `k` times, which does not change the sum of the array.
   - The final sum can be computed as `max_sum * (k + 1) + initial_sum` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - Kadane's algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in \(O(n)\) time.
   - The algorithm iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum and updating the maximum sum found so far.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm.
   - The provided `func_3` is incomplete and does not compute the final answer.

### Detailed Evaluation of Annotated Code:

- **Main Loop:**
  - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
  - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
  - If the maximum sum is negative, it sets it to zero.
  - It computes the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **func_1:**
  - This function is correct and returns the remainder when the integer `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

- **func_2:**
  - The function initializes `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`.
  - It iterates through the array `arr` and attempts to build segments.
  - However, the logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed:
    - It does not correctly handle the transition from positive to negative and vice versa.
    - It does not correctly append the last segment if it is positive.
    - It returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is incorrect.
  - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` after the loop, but this does not guarantee that the maximum sum segment is found.

- **func_3:**
  - This function is not used in the main loop and is incomplete. It does not perform any meaningful operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in `func_2` and the incomplete `func_3`. The logic for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is flawed, and the program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as arrays with all negative elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
