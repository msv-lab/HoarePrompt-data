Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `new_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list.***
