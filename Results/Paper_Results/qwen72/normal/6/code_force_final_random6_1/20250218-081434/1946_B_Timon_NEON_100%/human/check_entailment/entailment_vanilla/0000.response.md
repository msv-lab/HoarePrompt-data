### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**
   - This function returns the result of `number % 1000000007`.
   - This is correct for taking the modulo of a number.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `new_segment` list is initialized as an empty list, but it is used without proper initialization.
     - The `max_segment` list is initialized as `[0, 0]`, but it is not clear what these values represent.
     - The function appends segments to `segments_variants` but does not handle the case where `new_segment` is empty correctly.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array ends with a positive number.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum sum and indices.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful computation.
   - It is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is not implemented.

5. **Overall Program Structure:**
   - The program lacks the main logic to process multiple test cases and to apply the operations `k` times.
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it is incorrect and incomplete.
   - The function `func_3` is intended to compute the final result, but it is not implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect and incomplete. It does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and it does not implement the logic to perform the operations `k` times and compute the final result.

**Correctness: False**
