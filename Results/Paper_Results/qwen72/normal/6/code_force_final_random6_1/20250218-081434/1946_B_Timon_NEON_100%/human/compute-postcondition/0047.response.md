Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements. `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty: If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0]. If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], `new_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0], and `segments_variants` is either [[0, 0, -1]] or an empty list. If `new_segment` is empty: If `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is [arr[1] + arr[2], 1], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[1]` is negative, `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- If `new_segment` is non-empty, it means `new_segment` is either `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` or `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`.
- The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds `arr[2]` to `new_segment[0]`.
- If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` was `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`, and after the code, it becomes `[arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0]`.
- If `arr[1]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` was `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`, and after the code, it becomes `[arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0]`.
- If `new_segment` is empty, it means `arr[1]` is negative, and `new_segment` remains an empty list.
- If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[1] + arr[2], 1]`.
- The states of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `segments_variants` are not affected.
