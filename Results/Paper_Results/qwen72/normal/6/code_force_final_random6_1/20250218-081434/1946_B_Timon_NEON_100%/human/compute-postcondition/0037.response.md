Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements. `i` is 1, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[1]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[1]` is negative, `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.**
