Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements. `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1. `new_segment` is either [arr[0] + arr[1], 0] or [arr[1], 1]. `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is either [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1] or [arr[1], 1, 1].**
