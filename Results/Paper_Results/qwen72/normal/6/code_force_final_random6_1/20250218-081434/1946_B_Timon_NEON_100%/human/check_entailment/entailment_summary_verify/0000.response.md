### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting the sum back into the array.
   - The key to solving this problem is to identify the maximum sum subarray and use it effectively in the operations to maximize the final sum of the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is correctly implemented and will be useful for ensuring the final result is within the required range.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - It initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` in a way that does not correctly handle the logic for finding the maximum sum subarray.
     - The logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is incorrect and does not properly account for all possible subarrays.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function does not return the maximum sum subarray in a usable format for further operations.

4. **Function 3: `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - However, the function is not implemented at all. It initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else, returning `None`.
   - This means the program cannot correctly compute the final result.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
   - `func_3` is completely unimplemented and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The program will not produce the correct output for any test case because the core logic for the operations is missing.

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case:**
  ```
  Input:
  1
  3 3
  2 2 8
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  96
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  - The program will not produce any output because `func_3` is not implemented and `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incomplete and does not correctly handle the problem requirements.
- `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
- `func_3` is not implemented at all, which is a critical missing component.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
