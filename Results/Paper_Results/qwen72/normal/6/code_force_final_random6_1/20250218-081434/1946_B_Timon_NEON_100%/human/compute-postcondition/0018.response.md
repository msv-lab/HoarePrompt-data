Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is a list, and `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains one element which is [0, 0, -1]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` contains one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, the first element of `new_segment` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[0]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.***
