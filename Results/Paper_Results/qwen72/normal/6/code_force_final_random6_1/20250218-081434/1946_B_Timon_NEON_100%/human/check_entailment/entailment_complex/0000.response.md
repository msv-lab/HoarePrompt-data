Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the output is within the required modulo range.
   - **`func_2`**: This function is intended to find the segment with the highest sum in the array. However, there are several issues with its implementation:
     - The function does not handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers correctly. It should return the maximum sum of any subarray, which could be zero if the array is all negative.
     - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum. It should consider all possible subarrays, not just the ones built during the loop.
     - The function returns a segment with more than one element, which is not necessary for the problem. The problem only requires the maximum sum, not the indices of the segment.
   - **`func_3`**: This function is not used in the main program and does not contribute to solving the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else, returning `None`.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it sets it to 0.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.

4. **Correctness of the Main Program**:
   - The main program's logic is flawed because `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum.
   - The formula used to calculate the final answer is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the maximum subarray sum and then use it to calculate the final sum after `k` operations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum segment sum, and the formula used in the main program is not correct for the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
