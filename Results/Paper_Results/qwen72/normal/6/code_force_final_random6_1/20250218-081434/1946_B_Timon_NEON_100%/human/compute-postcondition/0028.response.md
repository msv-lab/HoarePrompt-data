Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_segment` is `new_segment`, `max_sum` is -1, `segments_variants` contains one element which is `new_segment` + [0].**

The value of `max_segment` has been updated to `new_segment`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
