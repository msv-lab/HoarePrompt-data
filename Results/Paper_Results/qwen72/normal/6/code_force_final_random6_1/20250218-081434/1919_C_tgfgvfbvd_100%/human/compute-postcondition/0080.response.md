Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `a` if all elements are the same), and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` with new integer values provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but `l` is now a new list of integers based on the user input.
