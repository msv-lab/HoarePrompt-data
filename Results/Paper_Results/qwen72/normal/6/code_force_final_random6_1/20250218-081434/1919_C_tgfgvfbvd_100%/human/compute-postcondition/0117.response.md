Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n-1`. After the loop, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists), and `c` is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` decreases by 1 after each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0 if the loop ran the maximum number of times (i.e., `t` times), or it will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^4 if the loop ran fewer times.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is the input integer for each test case, and it remains unchanged within each test case.
- **`l`**: The list `l` is the list of integers input by the user for each test case, and it remains unchanged within each test case.
- **`x`**: The variable `x` is used in the inner loop and will be `n-1` after the inner loop completes for each test case.
- **`a`**: After the inner loop completes, `a` will hold the smallest integer in the list `l`.
- **`b`**: After the inner loop completes, `b` will hold the second smallest integer in the list `l` if it exists. If all elements in `l` are the same, `b` will be the same as `a`.
- **`c`**: The variable `c` will hold the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. This count is printed for each test case.
