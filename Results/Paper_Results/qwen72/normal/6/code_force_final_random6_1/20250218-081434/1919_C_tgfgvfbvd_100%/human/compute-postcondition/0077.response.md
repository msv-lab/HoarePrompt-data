To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now.
2. **`n`**: An input integer greater than 0. This is the length of the list `l`.
3. **`l`**: A list of integers input by the user. The exact values of the integers in the list are not specified, but we know the list has `n` elements.
4. **`x`**: This is defined as `n - 1`. Since `n` is the length of the list `l`, `x` will be the index of the last element in the list `l`.
5. **`a`**: The smallest integer in the list `l`.
6. **`b`**: The second smallest integer in the list `l`. If all elements in the list `l` are the same, then `b` will be equal to `a`.
7. **`c`**: The number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the value of `c`:

- **`a`** is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
- **`b`** is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or equal to `a` if all elements are the same).
- **`c`** is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Since `a` is the smallest integer and `b` is the second smallest integer (or equal to `a` if all elements are the same), any element in `l` that is greater than `b` will also be greater than `a`. Therefore, `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.

If all elements in `l` are the same, then `a` and `b` will both be equal to that value, and `c` will be 0 because no element can be greater than itself.

If there are distinct elements in `l`, `c` will be the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element.

Thus, the `print(c)` statement will print the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest element (or the smallest element if all elements are the same).

Output: **c (where c is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest element in the list `l`)**
