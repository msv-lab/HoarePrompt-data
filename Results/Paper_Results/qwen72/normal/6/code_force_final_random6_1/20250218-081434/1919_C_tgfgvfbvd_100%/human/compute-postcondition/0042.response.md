Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are both set to `float('inf')`, which is a very large positive number representing infinity.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- Since `a` and `b` are now both `float('inf')`, the count `c` of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b` will remain the same as it was before, as no element in `l` can be greater than infinity.
