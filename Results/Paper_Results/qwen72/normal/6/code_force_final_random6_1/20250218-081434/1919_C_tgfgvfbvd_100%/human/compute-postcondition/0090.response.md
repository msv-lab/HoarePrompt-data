Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and if `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
