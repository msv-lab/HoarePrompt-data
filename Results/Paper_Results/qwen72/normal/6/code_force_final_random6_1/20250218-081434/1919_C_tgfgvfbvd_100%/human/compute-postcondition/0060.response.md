Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 0 or 1. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their values, and `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions.***
