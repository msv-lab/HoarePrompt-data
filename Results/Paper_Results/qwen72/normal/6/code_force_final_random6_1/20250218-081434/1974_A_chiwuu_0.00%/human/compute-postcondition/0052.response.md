Postcondition: ***`t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`. `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.***
