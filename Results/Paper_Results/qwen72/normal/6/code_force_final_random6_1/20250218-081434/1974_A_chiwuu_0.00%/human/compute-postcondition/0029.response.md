Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `b * 30 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`.
- Initially, `t` is equal to `b * 2`.
- Therefore, the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`) remain unchanged.
