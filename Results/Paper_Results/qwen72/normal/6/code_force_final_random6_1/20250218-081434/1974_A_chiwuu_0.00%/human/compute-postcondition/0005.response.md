Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t` is now equal to `2 * b`.**

The value of `t` has been updated to `2 * b`, while the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new value of `t` is still within the range 1 to 10^4, as `b` is an integer value derived from the second input string and `t` is now twice that value.
