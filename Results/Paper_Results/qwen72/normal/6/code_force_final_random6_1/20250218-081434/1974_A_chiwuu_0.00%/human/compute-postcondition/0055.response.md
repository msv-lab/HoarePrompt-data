Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is the integer value of the last input string, `b` is the integer value of the second last input string, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`; otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.**

Natural language explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the input integer.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop index `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time, ending at `n - 1`.
- The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `t` is updated in each iteration based on the input values `a` and `b` for that iteration.
- The final value of `t` is determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `t` is updated based on the conditions described in the loop body.
- `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last input string provided in the `n`-th iteration.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` in the last iteration.
- If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
- If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`, and `t` is updated based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.
