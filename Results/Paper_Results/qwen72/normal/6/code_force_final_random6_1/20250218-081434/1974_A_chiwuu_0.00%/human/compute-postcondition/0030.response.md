Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, and `t1` is equal to `b * 30 - b * 4`. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.***
