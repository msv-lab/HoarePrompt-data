Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `b * 30 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `b * 2`.
- `t1` was initially `t * 15 - b * 4`. Since `t` is now `b * 2`, `t1` becomes `(b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, which simplifies to `b * 30 - b * 4`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `b` remains the integer value of the second input string.
