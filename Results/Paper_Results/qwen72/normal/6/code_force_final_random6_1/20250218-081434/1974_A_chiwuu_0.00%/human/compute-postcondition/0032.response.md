Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
