Output State: **`t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `b * 30 - b * 4`.**

The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of its previous value by 5. The other variables remain unchanged.
