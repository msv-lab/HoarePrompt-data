### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, which represents the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The function then calculates the number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons. This is done by dividing `t` by 5 and rounding up if there is a remainder. This is correct because each screen has 5 rows, and each 2x2 icon occupies 2 rows, so `b * 2` gives the total number of rows needed for 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` (the remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), the function correctly leaves `t` unchanged, as all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the function calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by setting `t2` to `a - t1` and then dividing `t2` by 15 and rounding up if there is a remainder. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

5. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and then for 1x1 icons is sound and matches the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
