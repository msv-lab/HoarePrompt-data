You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Example

    2 0
    
    15 0

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `t` based on `b` and updates `t` based on the relationship between `a` and a derived value `t1`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `t` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` test cases have been processed, and `t` has been printed for each case. The final state of the program includes the processed values of `t` for each test case, but the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, `t1`, and `i` are not retained for use outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (a) is exactly 15 and the number of 2x2 icons (b) is 0. According to the problem description, if there are exactly 15 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons, only one screen is needed. However, the program will incorrectly output 2 screens in this case.

Here is the specific input that causes the issue:
```
1
15 0
```

The program will output:
```
2
```

But the expected output should be:
```
1
```
