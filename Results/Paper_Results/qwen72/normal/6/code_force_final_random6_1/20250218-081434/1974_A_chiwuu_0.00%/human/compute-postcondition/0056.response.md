The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it seems that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with two integer parameters `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. The function is expected to process these test cases, but the exact output or return value is not specified in the given information.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function definition and the provided constraints, I will assume that the function internally processes these test cases and returns a result for each case. Since the exact output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integer parameters `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not defined in the given information.**
