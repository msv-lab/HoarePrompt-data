### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns). Therefore, the number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons is `b * 2` (since each screen can hold up to 2 such icons).
   - The function then checks if `b * 2` is a multiple of 5. If it is, it divides by 5 to get the number of screens. If not, it adds 1 to the result of the division to account for the partial screen.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done by `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t` is the number of screens and `b * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - It then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`a`). If they are, the number of screens `t` remains the same. If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Additional Screens Calculation**:
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the function calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by `t2 = a - t1`, where `t1` is the number of remaining cells.
   - The function then checks if `t2` is a multiple of 15. If it is, it adds `t2 // 15` to the total number of screens. If not, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the partial screen.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can hold up to 2 such icons, so `b * 2` gives the total number of screens needed if we only consider 2x2 icons.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they are sufficient for 1x1 icons is also correct. The function correctly calculates the remaining cells and updates the number of screens if needed.
- The logic for calculating additional screens for 1x1 icons is correct. It correctly handles both cases where the remaining icons fit exactly into the remaining cells and where they don't.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It processes the input, calculates the required number of screens, and prints the result for each test case. The logic and steps are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
