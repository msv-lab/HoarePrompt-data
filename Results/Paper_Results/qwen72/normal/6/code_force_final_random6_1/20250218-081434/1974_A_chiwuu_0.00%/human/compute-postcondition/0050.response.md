Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `a` remains the integer value of the first input string.
- The value of `b` remains the integer value of the second input string.
- The value of `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The value of `t2` remains `a - t1`.
