Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `temp` is a list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`, `max` is updated or retains its previous value**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the `temp` variable to a new list containing the elements from index 2 to index 4 (inclusive) of the list `a`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max`) remain unchanged.
