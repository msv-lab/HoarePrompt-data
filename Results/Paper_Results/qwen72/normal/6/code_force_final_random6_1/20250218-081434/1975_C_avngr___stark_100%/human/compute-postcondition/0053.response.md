Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-3` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from `a`, `t` must be greater than 0**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The value of `i` remains `n-3` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. The value of `max` and the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.
