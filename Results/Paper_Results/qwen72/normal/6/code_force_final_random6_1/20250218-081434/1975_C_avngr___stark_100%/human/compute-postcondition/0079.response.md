Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array and then reads `n` positive integers into the array `a`. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value in the array `a`. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds the maximum of the second largest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
