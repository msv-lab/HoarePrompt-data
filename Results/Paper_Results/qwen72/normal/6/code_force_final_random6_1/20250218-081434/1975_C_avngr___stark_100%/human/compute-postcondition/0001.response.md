The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` must be such that it is within the given range (1 <= t <= 500) to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable**
