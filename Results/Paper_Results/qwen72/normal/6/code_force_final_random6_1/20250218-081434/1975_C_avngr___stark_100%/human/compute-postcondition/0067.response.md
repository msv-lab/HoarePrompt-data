The `temp.sort()` method sorts the elements in the `temp` list in ascending order. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `a`, and `max` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
