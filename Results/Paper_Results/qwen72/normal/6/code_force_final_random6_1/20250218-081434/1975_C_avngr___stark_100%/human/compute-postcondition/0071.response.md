Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` in ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
