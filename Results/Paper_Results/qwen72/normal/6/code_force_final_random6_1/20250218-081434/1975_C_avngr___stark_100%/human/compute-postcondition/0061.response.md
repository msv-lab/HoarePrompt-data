The `temp.sort()` method sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `i`, `max`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `temp` now contains the first three elements of `a` in sorted order.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` in sorted ascending order.**
