Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`.**

The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` was already specified as a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, sorting it again does not change its order. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition to update `max` is still valid and depends on the value of `temp[1]` relative to `max`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
