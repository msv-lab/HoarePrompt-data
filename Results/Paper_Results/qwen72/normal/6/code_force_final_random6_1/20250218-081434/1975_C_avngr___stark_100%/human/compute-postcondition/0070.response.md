The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n - 2`, so `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
