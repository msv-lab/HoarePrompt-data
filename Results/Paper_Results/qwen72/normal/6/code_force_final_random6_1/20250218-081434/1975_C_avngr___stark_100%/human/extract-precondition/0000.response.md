Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The array `a` consists of positive integers, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. The elements of the array `a` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
