Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is 2, and `cn` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the previous iteration's condition. If `num[i]` equals `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 3 or 4. Otherwise, `cn` is 2 or 3, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
