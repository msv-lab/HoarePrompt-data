Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, and the loop has completed its execution. All other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ii`, `ck`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the first two elements of `onum` are equal, `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, all other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 2, `ii` is 2. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
