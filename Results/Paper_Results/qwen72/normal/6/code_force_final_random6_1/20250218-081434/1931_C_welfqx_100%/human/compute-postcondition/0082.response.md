Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` remains 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index of the first inequality found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is 0 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `ii` is `n-1` if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is 1 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list, `cn` is 1 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num` and `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list plus the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**
