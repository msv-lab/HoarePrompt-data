Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index of the first inequality found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num` (now reversed again to its original order), `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the first integer in the list `num`, `i` is 0 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `ii` is `n-1` if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
        cn += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is increased by 1. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`. If `num[i]` equals `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
