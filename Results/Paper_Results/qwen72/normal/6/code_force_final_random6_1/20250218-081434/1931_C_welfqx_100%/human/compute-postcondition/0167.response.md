Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is `cn + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. The initial value of `cn` is not specified, but it is updated by adding 1 to its current value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
