### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, you receive back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`, and it must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `vals` and stores it in `den`.
   - It then calculates `vprod` as the list of `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - It checks if `den - sum(vprod)` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints the list `vprod`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers `vals` is calculated correctly using `func_1`, which computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - **Distribution of Coins:** The program distributes the coins such that each `x_i` is `den // r_i`. This ensures that the total amount bet is `sum(den // r_i)`.
   - **Condition Check:** The program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. This is necessary because if `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means the total amount bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and thus, the solution is invalid.
   - **Output:** If the condition is met, the program prints the list `vprod`, which represents a valid distribution of coins. If not, it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Outcome:** If `N = 1`, the program will correctly print `-1` because you cannot bet in such a way that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back.
   - **Uniform Multipliers:** If all multipliers are the same, the program will correctly print `-1` because the total amount bet will be equal to the amount received back.
   - **Multiple Outcomes with Different Multipliers:** The program will correctly distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, as long as the multipliers are not all the same.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists and prints the appropriate output. The LCM calculation and the condition check ensure that the solution meets the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
