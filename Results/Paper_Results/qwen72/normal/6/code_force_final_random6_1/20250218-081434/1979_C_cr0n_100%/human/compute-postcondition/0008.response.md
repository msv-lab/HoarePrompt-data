The code snippet `den = func_1(den, x)` updates the value of `den` by calling the function `func_1` with the current value of `den` and the third element of the list `vals` (i.e., `vals[2]`). Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact new value of `den`, but we know that `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`.

The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 1 and 50, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier between 2 and 20, `den` is the result of a previous call to `func_1(den, x)`, and `x` is the third element of `vals`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `den` is updated, but the values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged. The new value of `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[2])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier between 2 and 20, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[2])`, `x` is the third element of `vals`.**
