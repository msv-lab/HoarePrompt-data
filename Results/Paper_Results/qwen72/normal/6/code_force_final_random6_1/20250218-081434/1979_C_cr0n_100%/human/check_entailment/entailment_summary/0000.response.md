### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `k_i` is the multiplier and `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`, and this must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is used to find a common multiple that can be evenly divided by all the multipliers `k_i`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier in `vals`.
   - It then iterates through all multipliers in `vals` and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
   - After computing the LCM of all multipliers, it calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `den // k_i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
   - The function checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. If this condition is true, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The LCM of all multipliers `k_i` ensures that `den` is a common multiple that can be evenly divided by all `k_i`.
   - The list `vprod` is calculated as `den // k_i` for each `k_i`, which means each `x_i` is `den // k_i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem statement. It ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it handles cases where no such distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
