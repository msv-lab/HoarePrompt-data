Let's break down the initial state and the steps leading to the `print` statement:

1. **N is an input integer**: This means `N` is a user-provided integer within the range 1 to 50.
2. **`vals` is a list of integers**: Each element in `vals` is a multiplier \( k_i \) for the i-th outcome, and each element is within the range 2 to 20.
3. **`den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and each element of `vals` in sequence**: This implies that `den` is modified by some function `func_1` which is applied to each element of `vals` in sequence. The exact nature of `func_1` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a function that updates `den` based on the elements of `vals`.
4. **`vprod` is a list of integers**: Each element in `vprod` is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.
5. **`den` is now `den` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`**: This means `den` is updated by subtracting the sum of all elements in `vprod` from its current value.
6. **`den` is less than or equal to 0**: This is a condition that must be true after the above steps.

Given the final condition that `den` is less than or equal to 0, the `print` statement will always execute and print `-1`.

**Explanation**:
- The initial value of `den` is not specified, but it is modified by `func_1` and then further modified by the operations involving `vprod`.
- The list `vprod` is created by dividing `den` by each element in `vals` using integer division.
- The sum of all elements in `vprod` is then subtracted from `den`.
- The final condition ensures that `den` is less than or equal to 0, which means the `print` statement will always execute and print `-1`.

Output: **-1**
