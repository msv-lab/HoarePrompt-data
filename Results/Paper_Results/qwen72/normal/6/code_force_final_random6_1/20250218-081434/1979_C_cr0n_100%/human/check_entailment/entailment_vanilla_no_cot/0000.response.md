Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program only processes a single test case. The problem description states that the input consists of multiple test cases, but the program does not handle this. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case in a loop.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates the bets using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, but this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet will be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The correct approach involves finding a set of bets such that the sum of the bets is less than the product of each bet and its corresponding multiplier.

3. **Output for Invalid Cases**: The program correctly outputs `-1` if the total amount of coins bet is not less than the amount received back for any outcome. However, the logic for determining the bets is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product of each bet and its corresponding multiplier. One way to achieve this is to set the bets such that the sum of the bets is just slightly less than the minimum product of any bet and its multiplier.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve_test_case(n, vals):
    total = sum(vals)
    bets = []
    for k in vals:
        # Each bet is 1, and we check if the sum of bets is less than the product of each bet and its multiplier
        if k * 1 <= total:
            return -1
        bets.append(1)
    return bets

def main():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
        result = solve_test_case(n, vals)
        if result == -1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
2. **Betting Strategy**: For each test case, the program sets each bet to 1 and checks if the sum of the bets is less than the product of each bet and its corresponding multiplier. If any multiplier `k_i` is such that `k_i * 1 <= total`, then it is impossible to win, and the program outputs `-1`.
3. **Output**: If a valid set of bets is found, the program outputs the bets. If not, it outputs `-1`.

This approach ensures that the total amount of coins bet is always less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, as long as a solution exists.
