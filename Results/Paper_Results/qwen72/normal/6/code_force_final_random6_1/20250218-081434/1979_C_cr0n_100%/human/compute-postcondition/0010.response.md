Output State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and each element of `vals` in sequence, `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division).**
