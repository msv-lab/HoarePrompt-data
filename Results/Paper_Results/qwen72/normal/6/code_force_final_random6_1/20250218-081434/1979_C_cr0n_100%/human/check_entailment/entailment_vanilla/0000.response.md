### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the \( i \)-th outcome is \( k_i \times x_i \), where \( x_i \) is the bet on the \( i \)-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \) and then distributes the coins in a way that ensures the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are in a ratio that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) using the formula:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
   - This is a correct implementation of the LCM calculation.

4. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The function reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The function initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each multiplier in the list.
     - This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all the multipliers.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - The function calculates the bets \( x_i \) as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \) for each outcome.
     - The total bet is then calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).
   - **Condition Check:**
     - The function checks if the total bet \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, the function prints \(-1\) because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
     - If the total bet is less than the LCM, the function prints the bets \( x_i \).

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are in a ratio that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.
   - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \text{LCM} \) ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no solution exists by printing \(-1\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
