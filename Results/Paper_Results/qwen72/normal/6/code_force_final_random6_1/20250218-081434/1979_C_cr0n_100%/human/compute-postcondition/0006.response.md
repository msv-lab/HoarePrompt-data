Output State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the second element of `vals`.** 

The value of `den` is updated to the result of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `den` and `x`, where `x` is the second element of the list `vals`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
