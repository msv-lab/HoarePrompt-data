Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers are the same. For example, consider the input where `n = 5` and `k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4 = k_5 = 5`. According to the problem description, the total amount of coins bet should be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program will output `-1` for this case, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists. For instance, betting 1 coin on each outcome would result in a total bet of 5 coins, and the return for any winning outcome would be 5 coins, which is not strictly greater but equal. Therefore, the program fails to provide a correct solution for this case.
