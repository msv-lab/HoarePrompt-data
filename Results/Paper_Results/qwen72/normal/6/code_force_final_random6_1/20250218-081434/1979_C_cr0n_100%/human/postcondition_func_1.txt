The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from user input. It then computes a value `den` by applying a function `func_1` to the initial value of `den` (which is the first element of `vals`) and each element of `vals` in sequence. It calculates a list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division. The function then updates `den` by subtracting the sum of all elements in `vprod` from it. If the updated `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns without any value. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces and returns without any value.
