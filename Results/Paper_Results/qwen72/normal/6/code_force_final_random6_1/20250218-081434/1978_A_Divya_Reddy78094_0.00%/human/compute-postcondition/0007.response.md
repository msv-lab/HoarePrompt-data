Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new integer input by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial conditions for `t`, `_`, and `nums`.
