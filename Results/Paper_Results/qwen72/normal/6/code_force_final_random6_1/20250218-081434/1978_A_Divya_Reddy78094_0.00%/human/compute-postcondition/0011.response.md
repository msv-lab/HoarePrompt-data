The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` is 1. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 2 and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
