Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following conditions must be true:
- The value of `t` must be greater than 0, as the loop needs to execute at least once.
- The loop variable `_` will be `t-1`, because the loop runs from `_ = 0` to `_ = t-1`.
- For each iteration, `n` is an input integer representing the number of books.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, representing the number of pages in each book for that iteration.
- The loop will have printed the sum of the two largest numbers in `nums` for each of the `t` test cases.
