Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are input integers, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), `x` is equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.***
