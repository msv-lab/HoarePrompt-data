The only objects in the loop head are `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function should accept a list of test cases, and the number of test cases `t` must be an input integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `steps` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is 0**
