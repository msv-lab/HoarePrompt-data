### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates, which are the corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Calculation**: The program calculates two distances `n` and `x` using the Euclidean distance formula, but it only considers the squared distances. This is fine because the area of the square is the square of the side length, and the side length can be derived from the distance between two adjacent corners.

3. **Comparison and Output**: The program compares the two squared distances `n` and `x`. It prints the smaller of the two distances as the area of the square. However, this approach is incorrect because the area of the square should be the square of the side length, which is the distance between two adjacent corners. The program does not ensure that it is comparing the correct distances to determine the side length of the square.

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to find the side length by calculating the distance between two adjacent corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be either the absolute difference in the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners. The area is then the square of this side length.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case: Coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2). The side length is 3 (either |1-4| or |2-5|), so the area is \(3^2 = 9\).
   - For the second test case: Coordinates are (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1). The side length is 2 (either |-1-1| or |1-(-1)|), so the area is \(2^2 = 4\).
   - For the third test case: Coordinates are (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39). The side length is 28 (either |45-17| or |11-39|), so the area is \(28^2 = 784\).

The program does not correctly identify the side length of the square, and it may print the wrong area if the coordinates are not correctly aligned. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
