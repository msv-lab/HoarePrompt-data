The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function, so it does not need to be explicitly adjusted. The function parameters `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
