Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `k`.
- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1, which remain unchanged.
- After executing the code, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as input integers, while the other variables (`t` and `i`) retain their initial values.
