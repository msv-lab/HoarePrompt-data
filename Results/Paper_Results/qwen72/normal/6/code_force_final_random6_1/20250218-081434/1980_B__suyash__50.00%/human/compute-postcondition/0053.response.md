Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `l` is a list of unique strings with at least 3 elements. If `k` is less than or equal to 0 after being decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]` and the program continues.***
