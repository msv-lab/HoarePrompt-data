The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should return a string "NO" if no suitable string can be constructed, or a string "YES" followed by a valid string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, and the length of the string should not exceed 200.
