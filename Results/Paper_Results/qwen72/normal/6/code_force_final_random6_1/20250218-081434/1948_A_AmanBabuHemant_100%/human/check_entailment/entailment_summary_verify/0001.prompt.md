You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters that contains exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string length should be at most 200 characters.
   - If no such string can be constructed, we should print "NO".

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

3. **Special Character Construction**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair, and an odd number of pairs cannot be formed.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the pattern).

4. **String Length Check**:
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". However, since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, this check is redundant and will never trigger.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - For `n = 6`, the program constructs the string "AAB" * 3 = "AAABAABAAB", which has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8). This is correct.
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character.
   - For `n = 2`, the program constructs the string "AAB" * 1 = "AAB", which has 2 special characters (positions 1 and 3). This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem constraints and constructs valid strings for even `n` values. It also correctly identifies and reports cases where no valid string can be constructed for odd `n` values. The length check is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
