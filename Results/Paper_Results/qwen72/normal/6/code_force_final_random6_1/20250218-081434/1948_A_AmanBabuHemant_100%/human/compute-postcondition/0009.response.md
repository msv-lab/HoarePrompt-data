Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer and is even.
   - `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer.
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times.
   - For example, if `n` is 6, then `n // 2` is 3, and `s` will be 'AAB' repeated 3 times, resulting in `s = 'AABAABAAB'`.
   - The length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is `3 * (n / 2) = 1.5 * n`. Since `n` is even, `1.5 * n` will be an integer and will always be less than 200 as per the precondition.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the string `s` which is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The exact value of `s` depends on the value of `n`, but it will always be a string of the form 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and its length will be `1.5 * n`.

Output: **'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times (where `n` is an even integer and the length of the string is less than 200)**
