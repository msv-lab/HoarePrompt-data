The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `s`.

Output: **NO**
