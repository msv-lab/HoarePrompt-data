The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should return a string "NO" if no suitable string can be constructed. Otherwise, it should return a string "YES" followed by a valid string of uppercase Latin letters that contains exactly `n` special characters, with the total length of the string not exceeding 200 characters.
