The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second character of `s`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`. Since `i` is the loop variable and it will take the value of the next character in `s`, we need to update `i` to the third character of `s`.

Given that `s` is a string of length 5, the third character will be the next value of `i`. The values of `ac` and `bc` depend on the value of `i` in the loop body, but they are not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust them here.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 0, and `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0. If `i` is 'B', `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**
