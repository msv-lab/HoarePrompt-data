Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 1, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0, `bc` is 2 if `i` is 'B', otherwise `bc` is 1, and `i` is the second character of `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bc` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is 'B', `bc` was initially 1 and is now 2.
- If `i` is 'A', `bc` was initially 0 and is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `q`, and `ac` remain unchanged.
- `i` is still the second character of `s`.
