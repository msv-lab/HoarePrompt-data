The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each providing a distinct string `s` of length 5 consisting of letters `A` and `B`. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. After processing all test cases, the function prints either 'A' or 'B' based on the last input string `s`: it prints 'A' if the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'B' characters, and 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value.
