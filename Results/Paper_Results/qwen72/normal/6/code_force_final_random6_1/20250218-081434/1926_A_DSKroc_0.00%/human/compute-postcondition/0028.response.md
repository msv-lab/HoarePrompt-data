Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 1, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 1, `i` is 'B'.**

The value of `bc` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `i` is the first character of `s` and `i` is 'B', which is still valid.
