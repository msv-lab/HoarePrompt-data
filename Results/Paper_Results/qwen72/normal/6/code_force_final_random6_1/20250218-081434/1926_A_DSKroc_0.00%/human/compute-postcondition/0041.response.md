Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 2, `ac` is 0, and `bc` is 0.**

The value of `bc` has been reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is still an integer between 3 and 32, `s` is still a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', `q` is still 2, and `ac` is still 0.
