The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again for the second character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and `i` is the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 0, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. If `i` is 'B', `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1.**
