Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The issue with the program is indeed the incorrect indentation of the `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks. As a result, the program only evaluates and prints the result for the last test case, instead of evaluating and printing the result for each test case individually as required by the problem description. The corrected version of the program, as provided in the original assessment, fixes this issue by correctly indenting the `if` and `else` blocks within the loop that processes each test case. This ensures that the program prints the correct result for each test case.

Final: **False**
