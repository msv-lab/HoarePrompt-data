Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, either `n` is not 0 or `m` is not even, `l` is a string representing the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`.** 

In natural language: The variable `q` is now set to 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, where `p` is the length of the binary string `l` representing the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
