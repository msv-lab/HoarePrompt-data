Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `m` is an even integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - Since `n` is 0 and `m` is an even integer greater than 0, `k` is calculated as:
     \[
     k = |n - m| = |0 - m| = m
     \]
   - `m` is an even integer greater than 0, so `k` is also an even integer greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `k` is not a power of 2.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is:
     ```
     print(2)
     ```

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer 2.
   - The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **2**
