Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the last `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `D` is updated to the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are specific integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user with at least `m + 1` elements, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D` (updated to `cnt_bb - D`), `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `tot` is the final sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `D` is the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the final Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, and `C` is the final Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D`. The values of `cnt_bb`, `cnt_aa`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `nabors`, `aa`, and `bb` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
