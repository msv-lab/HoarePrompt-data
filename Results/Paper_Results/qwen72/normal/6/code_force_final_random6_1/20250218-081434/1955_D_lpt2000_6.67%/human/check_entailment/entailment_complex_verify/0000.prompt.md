You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `tot` is the final sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the entire loop execution, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `D` is the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the final Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, and `C` is the final Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D`. The values of `cnt_bb`, `cnt_aa`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `nabors`, `aa`, and `bb` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the window size `m`, and the threshold `k`, followed by two lists of integers `aa` and `bb`. It calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in `aa` contains at least `k` elements that are also in `bb`. The function prints the count of such occurrences for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the final count of valid windows (`fnd`), the final intersection of elements (`D`), and the final counts of elements in `aa` and `bb` that are not in the intersection (`E` and `C` respectively). The original input values and lists remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the transition of elements in and out of the sliding window. Specifically, the logic for updating the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The subsegments of length 3 in the array `a` are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[3, 4, 5]`.
- The subsegment `[1, 2, 3]` matches all elements in `b` and thus is good.
- The subsegment `[2, 3, 4]` matches 2 elements in `b` and thus is good.
- The subsegment `[3, 4, 5]` matches 1 element in `b` and thus is not good.

The program incorrectly counts only 2 good subsegments instead of 3. The issue lies in how the program updates the counters when sliding the window, leading to incorrect counts of matching elements.
