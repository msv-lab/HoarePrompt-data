The loop head contains the variables `i` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `i` must be able to take on the values of the characters in `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `i` is 1 greater than the last integer value of `i` used in the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` will take on the values of the characters in `s` during the loop. Since `i` is not used in the loop head to control the loop, it does not need to be adjusted in the context of the loop's execution. However, the loop will only execute if `s` is non-empty, which is already given.

Therefore, the state should be:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `i` will take on the values of the characters in `s` during the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` will take on the values of the characters in `s` during the loop.**
