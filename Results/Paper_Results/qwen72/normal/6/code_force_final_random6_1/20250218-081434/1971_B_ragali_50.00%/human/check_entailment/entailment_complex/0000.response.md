### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and processes it.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The function creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates over each character in `s` and adds it to the set `a`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The function checks if the length of the set `a` is greater than 1. This is correct because if `s` contains more than one unique character, it is possible to rearrange the characters to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

4. **String Rearrangement:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character, the function attempts to create a new string `r` by:
     - Splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
     - Reversing the entire string `s`.
     - If both of the above methods result in a string that is equal to `s`, it tries concatenating the second half with the first half again.
   - This logic ensures that at least one of the methods will produce a string `r` that is not equal to `s` if `s` has more than one unique character.

5. **Output:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character, the function prints 'YES' and the rearranged string `r`.
   - If the set `a` has one or fewer unique characters, the function prints 'NO'.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `s` has only one unique character correctly by printing 'NO'.
   - The function also handles the case where `s` is a single character correctly by printing 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program is logically correct and handles all the specified cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that for strings with more than one unique character, a different string is produced, and for strings with one or fewer unique characters, it correctly reports that no such rearrangement is possible.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
