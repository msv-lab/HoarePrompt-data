### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is designed to find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`. This is a common approach in binary search, but it needs to be carefully implemented to handle edge cases and ensure correctness.
   - The function initializes `l` and `r` to `0` and `n - 1` respectively, which is correct for a 0-based index array.
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is also correct, as it ensures the search continues until the range is exhausted.
   - Inside the loop, the midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which is standard for binary search.
   - The condition `if array[mid] >= find:` correctly updates `r` to `mid - 1` if the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to `find`, and `l` to `mid + 1` otherwise. This ensures that the search narrows down to the correct position.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - After the binary search, the function checks if `l` (the index where `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`) is the same as the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the same as the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns a list of two strings: `str(l + 1)` and `str(array.index(find) + 1)`, indicating the indices to be swapped.
   - If `l` is the same as the index of `find`, it prints `0` and returns `None`.

3. **Flaws in the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program fails for the input:
     ```
     1
     5 3
     1 2 4 5 3
     ```
     However, let's analyze this case:
     - The binary search will find `l = 2` (0-based index) because `array[2] = 4` and `4 >= 3`.
     - The index of `3` in the array is `4` (0-based index).
     - Since `l` (2) is not equal to the index of `3` (4), the function will print `1` and return `['3', '5']`, which correctly indicates the indices to be swapped.
     - After swapping, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]`, and the binary search will correctly find `3` at index `2`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the position where the target element should be and performs the necessary swap if the target element is not already in that position.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and that the swap logic is applied when needed.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and prints the correct number of swaps and the indices to be swapped for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary. The binary search and swap logic are implemented correctly, and the program handles the given test cases as expected. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program fails for the provided test case.
