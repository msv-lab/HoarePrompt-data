Postcondition: ***`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2. If `array[mid]` >= `find`, `l` is 0 and `r` is (n - 1) // 2 - 1, and `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` is n - 1.***
