Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`, followed by the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The original assessment correctly identified a logical error in the binary search condition. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should indeed be `if array[mid] <= find`. This is crucial because the binary search is supposed to find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`. The original condition would incorrectly move the right pointer `r` when `array[mid]` is equal to `find`, which could lead to missing the correct position.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The original program's logic for swapping is generally correct. It checks if the element at position `l` (after the binary search) is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `x` in the array. This ensures that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the swap.

4. **Output Handling**: The original program has a minor issue with the output format. It should print the number of operations before the indices. The corrected program addresses this by printing `1` before the indices and `0` when no swaps are needed.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or where the element `x` is at the beginning or end of the array. The current logic seems to handle these cases correctly, but the binary search condition needs to be fixed to ensure the correct behavior.

6. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop to process each test case.

Given the above points, the original program has a logical error in the binary search condition and a minor issue with the output format. The corrected program addresses these issues.

**Final Evaluation**:
The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the binary search condition and the incorrect output format. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
