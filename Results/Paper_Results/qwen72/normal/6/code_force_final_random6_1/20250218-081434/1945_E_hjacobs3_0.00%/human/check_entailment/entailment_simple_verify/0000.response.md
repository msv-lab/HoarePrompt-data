Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly handle the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the correct position of the target element `x` after the search. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` is designed to find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if no such index exists.
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is correct for binary search, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`.

2. **Swap Logic**:
   - After the binary search, the program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap.
   - However, the binary search logic is incorrect, which means the value of `l` might not be the correct position for `find` in the sorted array. This leads to incorrect swap operations.

3. **Example Case**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5 3
     1 2 4 5 3
     ```
   - The permutation is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]` and the target element `x` is `3`.
   - The binary search should find that `3` should be at index `2` (0-based index), but due to the flawed logic, it does not correctly identify this.
   - The program incorrectly determines that no swaps are needed and returns `0`.

4. **Correct Binary Search**:
   - The correct binary search logic should be:
     ```python
     while l < r:
         mid = (l + r) // 2
         if array[mid] < find:
             l = mid + 1
         else:
             r = mid
     ```
   - This ensures that `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`.

5. **Correct Swap Logic**:
   - After the binary search, the program should check if `array[l]` is equal to `find`. If not, it should swap `array[l]` with `find` and then perform a second binary search to ensure the correct position.
   - However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
