Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `mid`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The new value of `r` is `mid - 1`, which is derived from the initial value of `mid` being `(l + r) // 2`.
