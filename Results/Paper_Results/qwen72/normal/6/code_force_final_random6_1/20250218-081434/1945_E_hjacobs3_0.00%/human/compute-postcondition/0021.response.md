The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
   - `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n.
   - `n` is the length of `array`.
   - `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists.
   - `r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists.
   - `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` are not directly used in the `print` statement.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant integer `1`, the output will always be `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
