Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `r`, and `mid`) remain unchanged. The initial condition that `r` is `n - 1` if `array[mid]` < `find` is still valid, and `mid` is still calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
