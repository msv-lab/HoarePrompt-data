Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0], p[2], p[4], ..., p[n-2]` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` (or 1 if `n` is odd) respectively, `p[1]` is `1 + n % 2`, `p[3]` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[5]` is `5 + n % 2`, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `7 + n % 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is incremented by 2.
- Initially, `ind` is `5 + n % 2`.
- After the increment, `ind` becomes `7 + n % 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
