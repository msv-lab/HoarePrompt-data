Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly generate a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given conditions. It places the largest numbers in even indices and the smallest numbers in odd indices, ensuring that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation can both divide two other consecutive numbers. This approach works for all potential cases within the given constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The program also handles the input correctly, reading multiple test cases and generating the required output format. No edge cases or logical errors have been identified that would violate the problem's requirements.
