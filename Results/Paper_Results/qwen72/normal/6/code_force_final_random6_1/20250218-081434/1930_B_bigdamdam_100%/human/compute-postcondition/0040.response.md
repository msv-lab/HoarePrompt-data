Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0], p[2], p[4], ..., p[n-2]` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` (or 1 if `n` is odd) respectively, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `1 + n % 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `ind` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `ind` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
