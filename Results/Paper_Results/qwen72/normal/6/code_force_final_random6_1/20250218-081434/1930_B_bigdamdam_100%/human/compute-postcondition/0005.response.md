Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with `p[0]` set to `n`, `ind` is equal to `n`.** 

The code snippet `p[i] = ind` sets the first element of the list `p` (which is initially a list of `n` zeros) to the value of `ind`. Since `i` is 0 and `ind` is equal to `n`, the first element of `p` is now `n`. The other elements of `p` remain unchanged, and the values of `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain the same as in the initial state.
