The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `p[3]` is set to `ind`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 to 5, and `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop condition to still hold true.

State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `p[3]` is set to `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2, `i` is 5**
