Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `p[i]` is now `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2, `i` is 3, and `p[3]` is set to `ind`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is increased by 2, so the new value of `ind` is `ind + 2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged:
  - `n` must still be greater than 3.
  - `p[i]` is still `ind`.
  - `i` is still 3.
  - `p[3]` is still set to `ind`, but `ind` has been updated to `ind + 2`.
