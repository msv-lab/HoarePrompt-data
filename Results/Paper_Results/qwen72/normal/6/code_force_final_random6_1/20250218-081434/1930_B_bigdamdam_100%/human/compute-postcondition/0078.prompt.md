Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept an integer `n` as a parameter, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is the length of the permutation to be generated.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains the same, `i` is `n - 1` if `n` is odd or `n - 2` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0], p[2], p[4], ...` are set to `n, n-2, n-4, ...` respectively, and `p[1], p[3], p[5], ...` are set to `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ...` respectively, `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n // 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is the last odd number less than `n`, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0], p[2], p[4], ..., p[n-2]` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` (or 1 if `n` is odd) respectively, and `p[1], p[3], p[5], ..., p[n-1]` (if `n` is odd) or `p[1], p[3], p[5], ..., p[n-2]` (if `n` is even) are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., n - 1` respectively, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n + n % 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the last odd number less than `n`, `p` is a list where every odd-indexed element (starting from index 1) is filled with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2, and the even-indexed elements are filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of odd-indexed elements in `p`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
