Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros except the third element which is `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` (which is 2) with the value of `ind` (which is `n - 2`). The other variables and the structure of `p` remain unchanged.
