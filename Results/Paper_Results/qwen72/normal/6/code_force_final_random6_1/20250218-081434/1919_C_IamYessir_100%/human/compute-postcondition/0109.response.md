Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` must have at least 2 elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element plus 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.***
