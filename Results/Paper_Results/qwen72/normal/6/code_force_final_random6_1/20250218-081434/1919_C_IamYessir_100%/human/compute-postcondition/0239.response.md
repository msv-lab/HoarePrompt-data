Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1` (which is -1), and `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.**
