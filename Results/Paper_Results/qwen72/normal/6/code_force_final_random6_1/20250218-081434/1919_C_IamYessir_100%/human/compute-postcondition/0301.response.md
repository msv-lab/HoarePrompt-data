Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, then `b` now contains the second element of `lit`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `y`, the state of `b` and `y` remains unchanged.***
