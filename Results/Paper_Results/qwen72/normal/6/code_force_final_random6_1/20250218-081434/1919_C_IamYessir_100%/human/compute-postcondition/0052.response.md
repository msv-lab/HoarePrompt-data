Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is non-empty, otherwise `x` is infinity, `y` is the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`.
- The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is a specific value from the list `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- If `a` is non-empty, `x` is still the last element of `a`. If `a` is empty, `x` remains infinity.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` are still valid and unchanged.
