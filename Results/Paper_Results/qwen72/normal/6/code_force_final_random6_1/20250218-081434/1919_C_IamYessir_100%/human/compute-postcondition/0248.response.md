Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity.**

The code snippet `y = float('inf')` assigns the value positive infinity to the variable `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
