Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, and `s` is 3 if the fourth element of `a` is greater than the third element of `a`; `s` is 2 if the third element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a` and the fourth element is not greater than the third element; `s` is 1 if the second element of `a` is greater than the first element of `a` and the third element is not greater than the second element; otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
