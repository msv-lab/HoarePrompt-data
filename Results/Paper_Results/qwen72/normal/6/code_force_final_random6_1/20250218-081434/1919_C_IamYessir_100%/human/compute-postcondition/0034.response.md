Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, `b` is an empty list or a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[0]`), `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[0]`).**
