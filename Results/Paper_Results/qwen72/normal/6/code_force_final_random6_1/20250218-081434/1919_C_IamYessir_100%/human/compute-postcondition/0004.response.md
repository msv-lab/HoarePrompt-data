Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.**

The variable `cp` is initialized to 0, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
