Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The logic for deciding which subsequence (s or t) to add the current element to is flawed. The approach taken in the program tries to append elements to `a` or `b` based on a comparison with the last elements of `a` and `b`, but this does not guarantee an optimal split that minimizes the penalty.

### Issues:
1. **Subsequence Selection Logic**: The logic for deciding whether to add the current element to `a` or `b` is not optimal. The conditions used to append elements to `a` or `b` do not ensure that the subsequences are formed in a way that minimizes the penalty.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated by counting the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences, but the way the subsequences are formed does not guarantee that this will be the minimum possible penalty.

### Correct Approach:
To minimize the penalty, you should consider the following:
- The penalty is the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences.
- To minimize the penalty, you should try to avoid creating increasing pairs as much as possible.
- One optimal strategy is to sort the array and then split it into two subsequences such that one subsequence contains all the even-indexed elements and the other contains all the odd-indexed elements. This ensures that no increasing pairs are created within each subsequence.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lit.sort()
        
        # Split the sorted array into two subsequences
        s = lit[::2]
        t = lit[1::2]
        
        # Calculate the penalty
        penalty_s = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(s)) if s[i] > s[i - 1])
        penalty_t = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(t)) if t[i] > t[i - 1])
        
        print(penalty_s + penalty_t)
```

This solution sorts the array and then splits it into two subsequences, ensuring that no increasing pairs are created within each subsequence, thus minimizing the penalty.
