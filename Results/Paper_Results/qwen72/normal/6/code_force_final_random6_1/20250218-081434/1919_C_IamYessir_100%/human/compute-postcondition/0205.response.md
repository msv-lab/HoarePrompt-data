Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `y` (the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise infinity) is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x` (the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise infinity), then `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`.***
