Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` has one more element appended to it, which is `lit[1]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`), `y` is set to infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the second element of `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `a`.
- `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[1]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `b`, and `y`) remain unchanged, except for `x` which is now the last element of `a`.
