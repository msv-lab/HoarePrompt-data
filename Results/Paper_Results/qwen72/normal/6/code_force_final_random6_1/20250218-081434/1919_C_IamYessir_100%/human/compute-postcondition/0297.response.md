Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. The element at index 1 of `lit` is appended to `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index 1 of `lit` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 1, the element `lit[1]` is appended to `a`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `y`, and the condition for `x` remain unchanged.
- If `a` was initially empty, it now contains the element `lit[1]`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`.
- If `a` was not empty, the new last element of `a` is `lit[1]`, and `x` is updated to `lit[1]`.
