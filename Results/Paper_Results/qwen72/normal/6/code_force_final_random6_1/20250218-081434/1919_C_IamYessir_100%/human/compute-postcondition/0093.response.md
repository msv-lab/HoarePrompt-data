Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is still equal to `t`.
- `lit` is the same list of integers provided by the user.
- `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified during the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically:
  - If `x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty) is greater than `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty), the loop appends elements to `b` or `a` based on the comparison of `lit[i]` with `x` and `y`.
  - If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the loop appends elements to `a` or `b` based on the comparison of `lit[i]` with `x` and `y`.
  - The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements from `lit` that satisfy the conditions in the loop.
- `cp` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has processed all elements in the `lit` list according to the given conditions.
