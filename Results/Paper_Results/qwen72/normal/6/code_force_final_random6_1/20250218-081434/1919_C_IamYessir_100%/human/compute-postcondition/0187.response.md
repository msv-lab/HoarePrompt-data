Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `x > y`, then: If `y >= lit[i]`, `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is `lit[0]`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[0]`. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x`, `a` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]` if `lit[0] > y`, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0] <= y`, `a` remains an empty list, and `x` is set to infinity. If `x <= y`, then: If `x` equals `y`, `a` now contains the first element of `lit`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y`, then: If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now includes the first element of `lit`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` is a list with one more element, which is the first element of `lit`, and `x` is now the first element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is now `lit[0]`. If `x` is not less than `y` and `x` does not equal `y`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
