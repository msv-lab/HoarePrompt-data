Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` minus one, and the variable `s` will count the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than the element immediately before it, starting from the second element and going up to the last element. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `cp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
