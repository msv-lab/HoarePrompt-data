To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0.
3. The state before the loop starts mentions `t` as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but `t` is not directly used in the loop head. However, it is implied that `t` represents the number of iterations the loop will perform.
4. The loop will execute `t` times, so `int(input())` must be `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that is at least 1, which is consistent with the given range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must return a value equal to `t`**
