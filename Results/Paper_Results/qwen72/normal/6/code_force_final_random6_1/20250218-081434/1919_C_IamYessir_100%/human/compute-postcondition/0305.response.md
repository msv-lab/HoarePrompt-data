Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `x` > `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `b` now contains the second element of `lit`, and if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` > `y`, and `lit[1]` is greater than `y` and `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[1]`), and if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` (i.e., `lit[1]`). If `x` > `y`, and `lit[1]` is not greater than `x`, and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains the second element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `x` == `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and if `a` was empty, `x` is now `lit[1]`; if `a` was not empty, `x` is now the last element of `a` which is `lit[1]`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `lit[1]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is now the last element of `a`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `lit[1]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is now the last element of `b`. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `lit[1]` is less than or equal to both `x` and `y`, or if `x` is not less than `y`, the state of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.**
