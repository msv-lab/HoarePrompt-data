Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 2 if the third element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is 1 if the second element of `a` is greater than the first element of `a`. If neither condition is met, `s` remains 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 2.***
