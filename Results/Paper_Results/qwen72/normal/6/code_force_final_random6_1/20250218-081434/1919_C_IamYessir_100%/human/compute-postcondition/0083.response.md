Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list that has been modified to include the element `lit[2]` at the end, `b` is a list that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `x` is either infinity (if `a` is empty) or the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty). If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**

The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index 2 of the list `lit` to the end of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `a` was previously empty, `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is `lit[2]`. If `a` was not empty, `x` is still the last element of `a`, but now it is the element that was just added, `lit[2]`. The value of `y` remains the same, either infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty.
