Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `lit`.
- The initial state indicates that `lit` was previously a list of integers provided by the user, but this code snippet overwrites `lit` with a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `s`) are not affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `lit` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
