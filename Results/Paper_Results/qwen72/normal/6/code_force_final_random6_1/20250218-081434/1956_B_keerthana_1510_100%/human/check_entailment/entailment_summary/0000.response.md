Reasoning:
The provided program is not correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each have `n` cards.
   - The cards are numbered from 1 to `n`, and each number appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - You need to consider the optimal moves for both you and Nene.
   - Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize your score if there are multiple optimal moves for her.
   - The key is to understand how the game progresses and how the points are scored.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads every second line from the input file starting from the third line (which contains the card numbers for each test case).
   - It splits the line into tokens (card numbers) and calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - This difference is printed as the output for each test case.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the game's rules and the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens does not represent the maximum number of points you can score.
   - The correct approach involves simulating the game and considering the optimal moves for both players, which the current program does not do.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - You need to simulate the game and keep track of the cards on the table.
   - For each turn, you should choose the card that maximizes your score while considering Nene's optimal response.
   - Nene will always choose the card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours if there are multiple optimal moves for her.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
