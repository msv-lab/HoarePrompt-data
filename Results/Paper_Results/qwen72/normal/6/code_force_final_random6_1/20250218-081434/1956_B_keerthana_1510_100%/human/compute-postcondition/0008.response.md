Functionality: ** The function processes an input where each line represents a test case. For each test case, it reads a line, splits it into tokens, and prints the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. The function does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `a`. After the function concludes, the input file has been fully read, and the output for each test case has been printed to the console. **
