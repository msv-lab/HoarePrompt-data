The only objects in the loop head are the variable `line` and the list `[*open(0)][2::2]`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over every other line starting from the third line of the input file. To execute the loop one more time, the input file must have at least one more line that can be accessed by the slicing operation `[2::2]`.

At the end of the last iteration, the input file has at least 3 lines, and the loop has processed the third line. For the loop to execute again, the input file must have at least 5 lines, and the next line to be processed will be the fifth line.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The input must have at least 5 lines.**
