The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks if the list is a palindrome. If `arr` is a palindrome, the function returns 0. If `arr` is not a palindrome, the function finds the first pair of non-matching elements from the start and end of the list, then increments the starting index `i` to skip over any consecutive equal elements. The function returns the length of the subarray from the updated `i` to `j` (inclusive), or the length from `i` to the end of the list if `j` is the last index.
