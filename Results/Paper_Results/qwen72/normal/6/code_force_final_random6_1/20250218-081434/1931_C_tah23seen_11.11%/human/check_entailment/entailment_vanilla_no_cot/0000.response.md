Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying the Minimum Cost:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum cost by checking if the elements at the start and end of the array are equal and then moving inward. However, this approach does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of equal elements.
   - The function also does not correctly handle cases where the array needs to be made equal by selecting a value that is not at the start or end of the array.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not correctly handle cases where the array is already equal (it should return 0).
   - The function does not correctly handle cases where the array needs to be made equal by selecting a value that is not the first or last element.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Identify the most frequent element in the array.
2. Calculate the cost of making all elements equal to this most frequent element.
3. If the array is already equal, return 0.
4. If the array is not equal, calculate the minimum cost by considering the segments of the array that need to be changed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(min_burles(arr))
    t -= 1

def min_burles(arr):
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        return 0  # All elements are already equal
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common = freq.most_common(1)[0][0]
    
    # Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element
    cost = len(arr) - freq[most_common]
    
    return cost
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Check if all elements in the array are already equal. If they are, return 0.
- **Step 2:** Use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the array.
- **Step 3:** Identify the most frequent element in the array.
- **Step 4:** Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element by subtracting the frequency of the most common element from the total length of the array.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of burles is correctly calculated for all test cases.
