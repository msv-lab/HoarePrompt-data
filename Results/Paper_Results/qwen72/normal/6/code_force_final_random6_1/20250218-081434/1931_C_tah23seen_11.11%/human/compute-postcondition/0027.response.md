The variables in the loop head are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is increased by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[i]` (after `i` is increased by 2) must still be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

State: **`arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `i` is increased by 2**
