Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The input handling is correct. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself. The array `arr` is then passed to the function `func_1`.

2. **Palindrome Check**: The function `func_1` starts by checking if the array is a palindrome. It does this by comparing elements from the start (`i`) and the end (`j`) of the array, moving inward. If all corresponding elements are equal, the array is a palindrome, and the function returns 0, which is correct because no operation is needed to make all elements equal if the array is already a palindrome.

3. **Non-Palindrome Handling**: If the array is not a palindrome, the function finds the first pair of non-matching elements (`i` and `j`). It then increments `i` to skip over any consecutive equal elements starting from the initial `i`. This is done to minimize the length of the subarray that needs to be modified.

4. **Return Values**:
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, the function returns `j - i + 1`, which is the length of the subarray from the updated `i` to `j` (inclusive). This is the correct price for the operation.
   - If `j` is the last index of the array, the function returns `j - i`, which is the length of the subarray from the updated `i` to the end of the array. This is also correct because the operation will cover the entire subarray from `i` to the end.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a single-element array, the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - For a two-element array where both elements are different, the function will return 1, which is correct.
   - For a two-element array where both elements are the same, the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - For an array that is already a palindrome, the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - For an array that is not a palindrome, the function will return the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal, which is the length of the subarray from the first non-matching element to the last non-matching element (or to the end of the array if `j` is the last index).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the described cases and outputs the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
