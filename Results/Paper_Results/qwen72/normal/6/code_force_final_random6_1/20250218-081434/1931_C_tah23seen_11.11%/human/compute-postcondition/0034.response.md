The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `len(arr)`.

The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1. Here, `i` is increased by the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the initial `i`, and `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
- Case_3: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is `len(arr) - 1` and `i` is increased by the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the initial `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns 0, or the length of a subarray of consecutive equal elements starting from an initial index `i`, or the length of the subarray from `i` to the end of the list, depending on the specific conditions met.**
