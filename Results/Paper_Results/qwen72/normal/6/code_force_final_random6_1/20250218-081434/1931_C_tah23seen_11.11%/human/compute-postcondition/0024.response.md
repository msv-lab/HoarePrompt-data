Output State: **`arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`, `i` is increased by 1.** 

This means that after the execution of the code, the value of `i` is one more than its initial value, and the condition that `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]` is still valid, but now it refers to the new value of `i`.
