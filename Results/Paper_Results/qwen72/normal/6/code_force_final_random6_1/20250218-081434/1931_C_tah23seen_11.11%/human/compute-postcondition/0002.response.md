To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to check the conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `j`.

- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

The loop condition is `i <= j`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`.

Given that `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `j` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 (1 <= len(arr)), `j` will always be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
