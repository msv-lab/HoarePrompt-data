### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `i <= j`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward (`i += 1` and `j -= 1`). If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, if `i > j`, it means the array is a palindrome, and the function returns 0 because no operation is needed to make all elements equal.
   - If `i <= j`, it means the array is not a palindrome, and the function enters another loop to skip over consecutive equal elements starting from `i`.
   - After this loop, it checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If so, it returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j` inclusive (`j - i + 1`).
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j` exclusive (`j - i`).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Palindrome Check:**
     - The initial loop correctly identifies if the array is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - **Non-Palindrome Handling:**
     - The second loop correctly skips over consecutive equal elements starting from `i`.
     - The final return statements correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal:
       - If `j` is not the last index, the cost is `j - i + 1`.
       - If `j` is the last index, the cost is `j - i`.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic:
- The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple different elements in the middle that are not equal to the elements at the edges. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will return 4, which is correct. But in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the program will return 0, which is incorrect because the array is already a palindrome and no operation is needed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the array is already a palindrome but has multiple different elements in the middle. The logic should be adjusted to ensure that the minimum cost is calculated correctly in all scenarios.
