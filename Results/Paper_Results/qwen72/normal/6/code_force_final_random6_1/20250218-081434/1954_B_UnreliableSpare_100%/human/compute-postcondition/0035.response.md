Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 3 if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.**
