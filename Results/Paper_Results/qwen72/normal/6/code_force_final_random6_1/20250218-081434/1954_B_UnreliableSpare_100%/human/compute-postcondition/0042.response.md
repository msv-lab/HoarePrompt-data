Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `flag` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`. If `flag` is False, `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr`, and `cnt` is 0.***
