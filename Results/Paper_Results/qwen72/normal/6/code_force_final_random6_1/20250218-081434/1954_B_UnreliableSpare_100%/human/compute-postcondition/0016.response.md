Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The variable `flag` will be True only if all elements in the list `arr` from the second element (index 1) to the last element (index `n-1`) are equal to the first element (index 0). If any element is not equal, `flag` will be set to False.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes without finding any inequality. If the loop breaks early due to an inequality, `i` will be the index of the element that caused the inequality.
