Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, and `arr` is a list of integers read from input. If the second element of `arr` is not equal to the first element of `arr`, `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains True.***
