Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It checks if all elements in `arr` are equal. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not return any value. **
