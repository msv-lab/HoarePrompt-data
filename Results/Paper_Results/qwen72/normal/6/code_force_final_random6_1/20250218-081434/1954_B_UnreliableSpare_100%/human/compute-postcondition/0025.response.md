Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
