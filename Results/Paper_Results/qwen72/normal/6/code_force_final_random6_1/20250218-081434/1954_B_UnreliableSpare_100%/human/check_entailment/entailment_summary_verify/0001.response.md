### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A "beautiful" array can be transformed by replacing an element at index `i` with its neighbors if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It first checks if all elements in the array are the same by setting a `flag` to `True` and iterating through the array. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets the `flag` to `False`.
   - If the `flag` is `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. Hence, it prints `-1`.
   - If the `flag` is `False`, it means there are at least two different elements in the array. The program then tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to represent an initially large value.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `val`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements are the same and outputs `-1` in that case.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` and does not consider other possible sequences or the overall structure of the array.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful but can be made beautiful by removing elements. It should find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made beautiful by the given operation.
   - The program's approach is too simplistic and does not account for the complex nature of the "beautiful" array property.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no way to apply the operation `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` to any index `i` such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - One way to achieve this is to remove elements such that no three consecutive elements form a pattern where the middle element can be replaced by its neighbors.
   - The program should consider the entire array and not just the first element.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful but can be made beautiful by removing elements. It only considers the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
