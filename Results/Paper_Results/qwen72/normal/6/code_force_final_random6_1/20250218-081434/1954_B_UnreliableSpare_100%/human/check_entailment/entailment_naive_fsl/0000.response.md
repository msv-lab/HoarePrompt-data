Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still meets the criteria of being a beautiful array. Specifically, the program is only checking for the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`arr[0]`). This approach is flawed because it does not consider other elements that might also form sequences that can be reduced to make the array non-beautiful.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1`, as removing the last element (or any other element that is `1`) will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program will output `3` because it only considers the minimum count of consecutive `1`s starting from the first element, which is `3` (the first three elements).

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
