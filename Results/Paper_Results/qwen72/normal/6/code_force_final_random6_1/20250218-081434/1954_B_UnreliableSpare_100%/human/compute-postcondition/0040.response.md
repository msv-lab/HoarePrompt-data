Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is False (since the condition `flag` is not met), `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr` if any inequality was found, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`.**
