Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**
