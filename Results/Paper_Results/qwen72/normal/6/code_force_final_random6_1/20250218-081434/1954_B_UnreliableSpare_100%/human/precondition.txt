The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
