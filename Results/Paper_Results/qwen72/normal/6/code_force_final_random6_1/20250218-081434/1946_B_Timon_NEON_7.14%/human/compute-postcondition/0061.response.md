The only objects in the loop head are the variable `segment` and the list `segments_variants`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `segments_variants` to be assigned to `segment`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, and `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment. The last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, and `total_max_segment[0]` is greater than the previous value of `total_max_segment[0]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `segment` must be the next element in `segments_variants`, and `segments_variants` must have at least one more segment to consider.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment` and must have at least one more segment, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.**
