Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, and `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is less than 0, otherwise it is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment. The `segments_variants` list now includes an additional segment, which is the `new_segment` appended with the index `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list.
- The new segment is `new_segment` appended with `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- If the last element of `arr` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, so the appended segment is `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- If the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` contains the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, so the appended segment is `[sum of the last segment, index of the last element in that segment, len(arr) - 1]`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `max_segment` remain unchanged.
- The `segments_variants` list is updated to include the new segment.
