Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `new_segment` was initially not empty, `max_segment[0]` is either `arr[0] - 1` or `new_segment[0]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [0, 0, -1] if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is not an empty list: If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment` is [arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]. If `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]. If `new_segment` is an empty list: `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, and `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0]. If `new_segment` is not empty, `segments_variants` is a list containing one or two elements: the first element is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]; the second element is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1] if `arr[2]` is less than 0. If `new_segment` is empty, `segments_variants` contains one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]. If `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is [arr[1] + arr[2], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is [arr[2], 0]. If `arr[2]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
