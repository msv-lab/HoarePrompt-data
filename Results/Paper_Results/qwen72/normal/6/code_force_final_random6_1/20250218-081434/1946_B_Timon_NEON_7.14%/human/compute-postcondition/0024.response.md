Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `new_segment` was initially not empty, `max_segment[0]` is either `arr[0] - 1` or `new_segment[0]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [0, 0, -1] if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].***
