Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `new_segment` is not empty.**

However, since the program does not enter the if block and instead enters the else block, the correct postcondition should be:
