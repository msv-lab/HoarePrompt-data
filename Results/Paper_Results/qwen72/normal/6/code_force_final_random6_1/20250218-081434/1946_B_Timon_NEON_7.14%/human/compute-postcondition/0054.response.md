Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, and `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is less than 0, otherwise it is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment. The `segments_variants` list now includes an additional segment, which is the `max_segment` appended with the index `len(arr) - 1`.**
