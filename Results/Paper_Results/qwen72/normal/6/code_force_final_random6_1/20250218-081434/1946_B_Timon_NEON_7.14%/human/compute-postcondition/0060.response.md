Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`, and the current value of `total_max_segment[0]` is greater than the previous value of `total_max_segment[0]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.***
