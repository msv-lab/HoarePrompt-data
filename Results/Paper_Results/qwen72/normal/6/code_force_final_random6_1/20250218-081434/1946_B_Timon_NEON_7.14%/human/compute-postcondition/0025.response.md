To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `arr`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0:
  - `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0].
  - `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0].
  - `segments_variants` is an empty list.
- If `arr[0]` is less than 0:
  - `new_segment` is an empty list.
  - `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0].
  - `segments_variants` is an empty list.
- If `new_segment` was initially not empty:
  - `max_segment[0]` is either `arr[0] - 1` or `new_segment[0]`.
  - `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [0, 0, -1] if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- The loop is iterating over the indices of `arr` using `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- The list `arr` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue, so `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

### Final State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0:
  - `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0].
  - `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0].
  - `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].
- If `arr[0]` is less than 0:
  - `new_segment` is an empty list.
  - `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0].
  - `segments_variants` is an empty list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]**.
