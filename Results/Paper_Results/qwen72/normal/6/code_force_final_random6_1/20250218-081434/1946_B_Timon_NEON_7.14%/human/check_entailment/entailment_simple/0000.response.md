### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The final answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - The result is then passed to `func_1` to compute the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum segment sum in the array.
   - However, there are several issues with the implementation:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are initialized with a single element, but they are treated as having multiple elements (e.g., `new_segment[0] += arr[i]`).
     - The `segments_variants` list is used to store segments, but it is not clear why it is necessary.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
     - The final check `if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) : total_max_segment = [-1]` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the array contains only negative numbers.

5. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect.
   - The correct approach should involve finding the maximum subarray sum and then using it to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.
   - The correct formula should be: `max_segment_sum * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(a)`, where `max_segment_sum` is the maximum subarray sum.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - The formula used to calculate the final answer is incorrect.
   - Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
