Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the modulo operation, but it is not used in the context of the problem to compute the final result.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it has several logical errors:
     - The `max_segment` and `new_segment` are initialized as lists, but they are treated as if they are single values.
     - The `max_segment` is updated incorrectly, and the logic for handling negative and positive values is flawed.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it does not do so.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to:
1. Compute the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
2. Compute the total sum of the array.
3. Use these values to determine the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def max_array_sum_after_k_operations(n, k, arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    max_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    
    if max_sum <= 0:
        # If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best we can do is to add the total sum k times.
        return (total_sum * k) % 1000000007
    else:
        # If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can add it (k-1) times to the total sum.
        return (total_sum + max_sum * k) % 1000000007

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        results.append(max_array_sum_after_k_operations(n, k, arr))
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 12
test_cases = [
    ((2, 2), [-4, -7]),
    ((3, 3), [2, 2, 8]),
    ((1, 7), [7]),
    ((5, 1), [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]),
    ((7, 4), [8, 14, -9, 6, 0, -1, 3]),
    ((7, 100), [5, 3, -8, 12, -5, -9, 3]),
    ((6, 1000), [-1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000]),
    ((2, 1), [1000000000, 8]),
    ((5, 4), [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    ((6, 10), [48973, 757292, 58277, -38574, 27475, 999984]),
    ((7, 1), [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000]),
    ((10, 10050), [408293874, -3498597, 7374783, 295774930, -48574034, 26623784, 498754833, -294875830, 283045804, 85938045])
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`max_subarray_sum` Function**:
   - This function uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array `arr`.

2. **`max_array_sum_after_k_operations` Function**:
   - This function computes the total sum of the array and the maximum subarray sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best we can do is to add the total sum `k` times.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can add it `(k-1)` times to the total sum to maximize the result.

3. **`solve` Function**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases and returns the results for each test case.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
