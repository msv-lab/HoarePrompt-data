Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum from all the segments in `segments_variants` that were considered during the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` remains `len(arr) - 1`.
- The variable `max_sum` remains -1.
- The variable `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop.
- The list `segments_variants` contains all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`.
- The variable `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, assuming the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum from all the segments in `segments_variants` that were considered during the loop.
