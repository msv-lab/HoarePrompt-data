Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 5 + `2 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `PB` is updated to the integer value of the string at `data[index + 2]`.
- All other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `k`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `result`) remain unchanged or retain their previously defined values.
