The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `remainder_steps`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other states provided (`cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps`, `full_cycles`, `score`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0.

State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
