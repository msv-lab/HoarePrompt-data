### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary values for `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` from the list.
   - The index is correctly incremented after each extraction, ensuring that the correct values are used for each test case.
   - The results of each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - `calculate_score` is responsible for simulating the game for a given starting position.
   - It initializes the score and current position, and uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step at which they were visited.
   - The function correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected by breaking out of the loop and calculating the score for the remaining steps based on the cycle length and cycle score.
   - If a cycle is detected, the function calculates the number of full cycles and the remaining steps, and updates the score accordingly.
   - The function returns the final score after `k` steps or after handling the cycle.

3. **Game Outcome Determination**:
   - `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints specified in the problem description, such as the range of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and the values in `p` and `a`.
   - The program correctly handles cycles, which is a crucial part of the problem since the permutation can lead to cycles that need to be efficiently managed.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps, which is important given the large constraints (e.g., `k` can be up to \(10^9\)).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. It handles input parsing, cycle detection, and score calculation efficiently and accurately.

**Correctness: **True****
