The only object in the loop head is the variable `remainder_steps`. The loop can execute again if `remainder_steps` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be decreased by 1, so it is now greater than 0 but less than or equal to the previous value minus 1.

State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]`, `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`**
