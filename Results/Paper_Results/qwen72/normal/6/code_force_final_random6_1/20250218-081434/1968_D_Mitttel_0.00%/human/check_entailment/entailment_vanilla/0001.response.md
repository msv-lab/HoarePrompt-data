### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the necessary values for each test case. This approach is efficient for large inputs and avoids the overhead of reading input multiple times.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, `func_2` extracts the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` from the input data. It then calls `func_1` with these values to determine the winner of the game.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a given starting position. It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach each position.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position has been visited before), the function calculates the length of the cycle and the total score within the cycle. It then uses this information to efficiently compute the score for the remaining steps by adding the score of full cycles and the score of the remaining steps within the cycle.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The cycle detection is done using a dictionary `visited` to store the step at which each position is visited. If a position is visited again, a cycle is detected, and the cycle start is identified.
   - The cycle length and cycle score are calculated, and the remaining steps are processed to add the appropriate score.

5. **Final Score Comparison**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores. It then compares these scores to determine the winner and returns the appropriate result.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The `calculate_score` function efficiently detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps, ensuring that the score is computed correctly even for large values of `k`.
- The comparison of scores in `func_1` is straightforward and correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
