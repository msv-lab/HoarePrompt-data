Output State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]` + `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `current_pos` to `p[current_pos - 1]`. The values of `remainder_steps` and `score` remain unchanged, but the new value of `current_pos` is specified as `p[current_pos - 1]`. The precondition that `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The increase in `score` by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]` + `a[current_pos - 1]` is also still valid, but the specific value of `current_pos` has been updated.
