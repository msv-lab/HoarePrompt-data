The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, and `result` is the second value in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more value, and `result` will be the next value in `results`. Therefore, `result` will be the third value in `results` if it exists.

State: **`input` is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0, `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, `results` is a list containing at least three values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the third value in `results`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on, `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.**
