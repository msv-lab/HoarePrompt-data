Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now 13 + `5 * n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new `result`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]` and `data[index - 4]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 1]`, `p` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index - 4:index - 4 + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `13 + 4 * n + n`, which simplifies to `13 + 5 * n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
