Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `input` is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
2. `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`.
3. `index` is 0.
4. `t` must have been greater than 0 initially.
5. `results` is a list containing at least two values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
6. `result` is the second value in `results`.
7. `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on.
8. `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on.
9. `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on.
10. `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on.
11. `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `input` is a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a string.
   - `data` is a list of strings split from this input. For example, if the input is `"3 10 5 20 30 15 25 35 45"`, then `data` would be `['3', '10', '5', '20', '30', '15', '25', '35', '45']`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `index` is initialized to 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one test case.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` is called multiple times, and the results are stored in the list `results`.
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS` are extracted from the `data` list at specific indices.
   - `p` and `a` are lists of integers derived from the `data` list for each test case.

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - `results` is a list containing the results of multiple calls to `func_1`.
   - `result` is the second value in the `results` list.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(result)` statement will print the second value in the `results` list.
- Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, `result` is the second value returned by the function `func_1` for the first test case.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the second value in the results list, and results is a list containing at least two values returned by func_1 for each test case)**
