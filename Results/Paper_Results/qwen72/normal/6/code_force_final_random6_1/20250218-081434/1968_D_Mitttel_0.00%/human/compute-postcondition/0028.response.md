Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now 9 + `4 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` assigns the return value of `func_1` to the variable `result`.
- The value of `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.
- All other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or expressions.
