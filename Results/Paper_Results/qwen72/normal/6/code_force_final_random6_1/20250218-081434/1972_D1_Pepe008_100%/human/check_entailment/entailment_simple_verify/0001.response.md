### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can use the property that if \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - Substituting these into the condition, we get:
     \[
     d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = d \cdot (a' + b')
     \]
     This must be a multiple of \(b \cdot d = d^2 \cdot b'\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a' + b' \text{ must be a multiple of } d \cdot b'
     \]
   - Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, it seems to be incorrect because it does not correctly account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) is not correct. It should be based on the gcd and the multiple condition.
   - The additional check:
     \[
     \text{if } (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \text{ and } i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0:
     \]
     This check is also incorrect and unnecessary. It does not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible \(a\) and checking the condition directly.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The formula and the additional checks are flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the additional checks do not align with the required conditions for \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
