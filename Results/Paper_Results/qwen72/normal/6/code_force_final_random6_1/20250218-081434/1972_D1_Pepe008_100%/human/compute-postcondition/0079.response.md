Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is an input integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` from the last iteration, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` from the last iteration, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values for each iteration from 1 to `b` for each of the `T` iterations, with any additional 1s added when the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are met.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- The variable `T` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations the outer loop will run.
- After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be `T - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `T - 1`.
- The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last input provided during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `suma` will contain the sum of all valid `x` values calculated for each iteration of the inner loop, where `x` is computed as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each `i` from `1` to `b`. Additionally, `suma` will be incremented by `1` whenever both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true.
- The final value of `suma` will be printed after each iteration of the outer loop, but the state of `suma` after all iterations will be the sum of all these printed values minus 2 for each iteration.
