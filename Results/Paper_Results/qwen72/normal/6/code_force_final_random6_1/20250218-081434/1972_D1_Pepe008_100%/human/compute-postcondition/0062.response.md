The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. The initial value of `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. After the increment, `suma` will be `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1`, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i`**
