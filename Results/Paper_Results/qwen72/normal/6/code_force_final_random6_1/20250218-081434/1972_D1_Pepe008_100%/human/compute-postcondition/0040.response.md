Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is 0, and `x` is calculated as `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `x` using the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given `i` is 2, the expression becomes `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 2 * 1) // 4 + 1` or `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
