Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the function `func_1` has been called.** 

The initial state remains unchanged as the function `func_1` does not modify any of the variables `t` or `_`. The function `func_1` has been executed, but without knowing the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine any specific changes to the state.
