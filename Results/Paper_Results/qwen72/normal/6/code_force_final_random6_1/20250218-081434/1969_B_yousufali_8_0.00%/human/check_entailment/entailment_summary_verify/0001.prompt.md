You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integer `t` is still in memory, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `s = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line attempts to split the input string and convert each part to an integer. However, the input is a single binary string without spaces, so `input().split()` will return a list with a single element, and `map(int, ...)` will convert that single element to an integer, which is incorrect.
   - `n = 0`: This initializes a counter for the number of 1s encountered.
   - `ans = 0`: This initializes the total cost.
   - The loop `for i in range(len(s))` iterates over each character in the string.
   - `if s[i] == 1: n += 1`: This increments the counter `n` for each 1 encountered.
   - `if s[i] == 0 and n != 0: ans += n + 1`: This adds the cost of a cyclic shift to `ans` whenever a 0 is encountered and there are 1s before it. The cost is `n + 1` because it includes the 0 and all the 1s before it.
   - `print(ans)`: This prints the total cost for the current test case.

4. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
   - `for _ in range(t): func_1()`: This calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Issues**:
   - The main issue is in `func_1` where the input is incorrectly processed. The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers.
   - The correct way to read the input string and convert it to a list of integers is `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

6. **Corrected Function 1**:
   - Replace `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` with `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

7. **Correctness**:
   - After correcting the input processing, the logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
   - The logic correctly counts the number of 1s and adds the cost of cyclic shifts when a 0 is encountered after some 1s.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the input string in `func_1`. The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
