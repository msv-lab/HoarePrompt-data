The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. The value of `n` depends on the value of `s[i]`. Since `i` is 1, we need to check the value of `s[1]` to determine the value of `n`.

- If `s[1]` is 1, then `n` is 1 or 2.
- If `s[1]` is 0, then `n` remains 0 or 1.

Given the initial state, we can calculate the new value of `ans`:

- If `s[1]` is 1 and `n` is 1, then `ans` is incremented by 2.
- If `s[1]` is 1 and `n` is 2, then `ans` is incremented by 3.
- If `s[1]` is 0 and `n` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[1]` is 0 and `n` is 1, then `ans` is incremented by 2.

The values of `s`, `i`, and the condition for `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `n` is 0 or 1. If `s[1]` is 1, then `n` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `n` remains 0 or 1. `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.**
