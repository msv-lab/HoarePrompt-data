The function `func_1` reads a binary string from the user, represented as a list of integers (0s and 1s). It then calculates the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in the list that follows at least one 1, where `n` is the count of 1s encountered so far. Finally, it prints the calculated sum. The function does not return any value.
