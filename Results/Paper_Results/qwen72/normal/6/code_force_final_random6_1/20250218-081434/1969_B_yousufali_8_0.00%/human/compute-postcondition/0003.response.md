The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment. The loop depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Since `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`. However, the value of `t` itself does not change; it is the loop counter that increments. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
