Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `input().split()` to read the binary string, which is incorrect. The `split()` method is used to split a string by whitespace, which is not appropriate for a binary string. Instead, the binary string should be read directly as a string.

2. **Conversion to Integer**:
   - The binary string is converted to a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This will fail because `input().split()` will return a list of substrings, and `map(int, ...)` will attempt to convert these substrings to integers, which is not the intended behavior for a binary string.

3. **Logic for Calculating the Cost**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The current logic adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever a `0` is encountered after a `1`, which does not account for the optimal strategy of cyclic shifts.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

- The goal is to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.
- The optimal strategy involves identifying the positions where the string transitions from `1` to `0` and calculating the minimum cost to move all `1`s to the left of all `0`s.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    zeros = s.count('0')
    if ones == 0 or zeros == 0:
        return 0  # Already sorted
    
    # Find the first and last positions of '1' in the string
    first_one = s.find('1')
    last_one = s.rfind('1')
    
    # Calculate the cost of moving all '1's to the left of all '0's
    cost = min(n - first_one, last_one + 1)
    
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_cost_to_sort(s)`**:
  - Count the number of `1`s and `0`s in the string.
  - If the string contains only `1`s or only `0`s, it is already sorted, so the cost is `0`.
  - Find the first and last positions of `1` in the string.
  - The minimum cost to sort the string is the minimum of the cost to move all `1`s to the left of all `0`s, which can be either moving all `0`s to the right of all `1`s or moving all `1`s to the left of all `0`s.

- **`func_2()`**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read the binary string `s` and print the result of `min_cost_to_sort(s)`.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
