### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - **Original Code**: The function `func_1` reads the input string as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The correct way to read the input string would be `s = input().strip()`.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary for `func_2` correctly states that it reads an integer `t` and calls `func_1` `t` times. However, it does not highlight the issue with how `func_1` reads the input string.

2. **Output Handling**:
   - **Original Code**: The function `func_1` prints the result directly, which is not appropriate for a function that is supposed to return a value. The output should be printed in `func_2` after calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary for `func_2` does not mention that `func_1` should return a value rather than print it directly. This is a critical oversight in the original code.

3. **Logic**:
   - **Original Code**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. For example, for the string "101011", the program will output an incorrect result because it does not consider the optimal strategy for cyclic shifts.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary for `func_2` does not provide any insight into the correctness of the logic within `func_1`. The logic in `func_1` is indeed incorrect, as it does not account for the optimal strategy to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

### Corrected Version:
The provided corrected version of the program is accurate and addresses the issues mentioned in the original assessment:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = 0
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        else:
            cost += ones
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
```

### Final Evaluation:
- **Input Handling**: The corrected version correctly reads the input as a binary string.
- **Output Handling**: The corrected version prints the result in `func_2` after calling `min_cost_to_sort` for each test case.
- **Logic**: The corrected version correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the string sorted by considering the number of 1s before each 0.

Given the issues in the original code and the correctness of the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **False**
