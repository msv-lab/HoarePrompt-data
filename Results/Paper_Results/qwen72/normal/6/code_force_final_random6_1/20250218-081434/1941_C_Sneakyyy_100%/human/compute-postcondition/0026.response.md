To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement.
   - `n` is an input integer. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement.
   - `a` is an input string. This string is the primary source for the calculation of `ans`.
   - `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring. This variable is not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement.

2. **Task:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `ans` is calculated based on the input string `a` by counting the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie'.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the content of the string `a`.

Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
