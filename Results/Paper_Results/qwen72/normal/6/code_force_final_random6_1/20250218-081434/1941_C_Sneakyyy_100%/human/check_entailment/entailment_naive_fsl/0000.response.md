Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for incrementing `i` and `ans` is flawed. When a substring "map" or "pie" is found, the program increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1. However, this approach fails to account for overlapping substrings and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the input string "ppiepieeee". The program will find the first "pie" and increment `i` by 3, then it will find the second "pie" and increment `i` by 3 again. This results in `ans` being 2, but the correct answer should be 0 because the string is already beautiful.

Another example is the input string "mappie". The program will find "map" and increment `i` by 3, then it will find "pie" and increment `i` by 3 again. This results in `ans` being 2, but the correct answer should be 1 because removing the 'p' at index 3 will make the string beautiful.

The program needs to be revised to correctly handle overlapping substrings and to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated accurately.
