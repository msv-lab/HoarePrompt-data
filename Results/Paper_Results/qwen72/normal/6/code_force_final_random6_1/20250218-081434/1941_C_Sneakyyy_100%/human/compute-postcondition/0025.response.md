Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: This variable counts the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' are found in `a`. Each time such a substring is found, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- **`i`**: This variable is used to iterate through the string `a`. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 3 if a 'map' or 'pie' substring is found, or by 1 otherwise. After the loop completes, `i` will be the length of `a` minus 2 (if the loop ends naturally without finding any more 'map' or 'pie' substrings) or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.
