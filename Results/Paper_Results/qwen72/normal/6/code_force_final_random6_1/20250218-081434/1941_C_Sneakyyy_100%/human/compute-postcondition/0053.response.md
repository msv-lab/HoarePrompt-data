To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This suggests that `t` is a positive integer within a large range, but it doesn't directly affect the value of `ans`.

2. **`n`**: An input integer. This integer is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`, but it might be related to the length of the string `a`.

3. **`a`**: A new input string. This string is the primary source for calculating `ans`.

4. **`ans`**: The number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`. This means we need to count how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `a` without overlapping.

5. **`i`**: The index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less. This index is used to ensure that we only check valid 3-character substrings within the string `a`.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
