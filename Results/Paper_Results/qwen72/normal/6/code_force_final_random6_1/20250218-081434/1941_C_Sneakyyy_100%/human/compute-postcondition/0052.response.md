Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
- The value of `a` remains the same input string it was before the loop started.
- The variable `ans` will hold the total count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a`.
- The variable `i` will be the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring that was checked, which will be at most `len(a) - 2` (since the loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`). If no more 3-character substrings are left to check, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2` or the loop will have exited.
