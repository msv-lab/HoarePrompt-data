Output State: **`total_cost` is the previous `total_cost` plus `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price` is `price + 2 * tickets_to_buy`, `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap before the tuple was removed, `pq` is now a heap with the smallest tuple removed, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, `tickets_bought` is the previous `tickets_bought` plus the current `tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought < k`.**
