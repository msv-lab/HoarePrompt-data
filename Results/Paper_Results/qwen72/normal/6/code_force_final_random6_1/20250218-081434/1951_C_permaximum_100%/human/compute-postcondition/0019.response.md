To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `tickets_bought < k`.

### Analysis:
- **`tickets_bought`**: This is the variable that tracks the total number of tickets bought so far.
- **`k`**: This is the target number of tickets to buy.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `tickets_bought < k` must still be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is less than `k`.

### Current State:
- `tickets_bought` is the previous `tickets_bought` plus the current `tickets_to_buy`.
- `k` is a fixed value that does not change.

### Adjustments:
- Since `tickets_bought` is incremented by `tickets_to_buy` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is still less than `k` after the increment.
- The value of `tickets_to_buy` is determined by the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. This means that `tickets_to_buy` will be a positive value as long as `k - tickets_bought` is positive.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute one more time if `tickets_bought` is still less than `k` after the increment.
- Therefore, the state of `tickets_bought` and `k` must be such that `tickets_bought < k` remains true.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus the previous `total_cost`. `tickets_bought` is the previous `tickets_bought` plus the current `tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap plus `2 * price_increase`. `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap. `price_increase` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. `tickets_bought < k`**
