You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
    return total_cost



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (number of ticket types), `m` (number of tickets available per type), `k` (number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for each ticket type). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost reflects the cumulative price increase. The function does not modify the input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current price for purchasing tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought at the minimum possible cost.

3. **Price Increase**: The program correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days after purchasing tickets. The `price_increase` variable keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far, and this value is added to the price of each ticket purchased on subsequent days.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`) on each day. This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily ticket purchase limit and buys exactly `k` tickets.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price (including the price increase) by the number of tickets bought on that day and adding it to the `total_cost`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the program will buy all tickets on the first available day with the lowest price.
   - If `k` is large and the daily limit `m` is small, the program will spread the purchases over multiple days, always choosing the day with the lowest current price.

The program handles all potential cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
