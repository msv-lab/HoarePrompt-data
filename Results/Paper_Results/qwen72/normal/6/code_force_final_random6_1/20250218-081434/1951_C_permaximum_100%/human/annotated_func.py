#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]

    #State: `total_cost` is the total cost of buying `k` tickets, `tickets_bought` is `k`, `price_increase` is the sum of the number of tickets bought in each iteration, and `pq` is now a heap with the first `k` smallest tuples removed.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (number of ticket types), `m` (number of tickets available per type), `k` (number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for each ticket type). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost reflects the cumulative price increase. The function does not modify the input parameters.
