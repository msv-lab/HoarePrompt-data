Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This allows the program to always consider the day with the lowest current price first.

3. **Heapify**:
   - The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function is used to convert the list `pq` into a heap, which is efficient for repeatedly extracting the minimum element.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it extracts the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It then calculates the actual price for that day by adding the cumulative price increase `price_increase` to the extracted price.
   - The number of tickets to buy on this day is determined by `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that exactly `k` tickets are bought in total.
   - The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought on this day.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - The cumulative price increase is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the total cost is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all required tickets on the first day with the lowest price.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days, ensuring that the cumulative price increase is correctly applied.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a priority queue ensures that the program efficiently finds the day with the lowest current price, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the heap operations, which is efficient given the constraints.

8. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It ensures that the tickets are bought at the minimum possible cost by always choosing the day with the lowest current price and applying the cumulative price increase correctly.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program that needs to be addressed:

- **Heap Update**:
  - The program does not re-heapify the prices after each purchase. This means that the prices in the heap are not updated to reflect the increased prices for subsequent days.
  - For example, if the prices are [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and 2 tickets are bought on the first day, the prices should become [3, 4, 9, 5, 6] for the subsequent days. The program does not update these prices in the heap, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should re-heapify the prices after each purchase, or it should push the updated prices back into the heap. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Push the updated price back into the heap
        if day + 1 < n:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day + 1] + price_increase, day + 1))
    return total_cost
```

This ensures that the heap always contains the correct prices for the subsequent days.

Given the above reasoning and the identified issue, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not correctly update the prices in the heap after each purchase, which can lead to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
