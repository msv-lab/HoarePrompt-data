Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (number of ticket types), `m` (number of tickets available per type), `k` (number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for each ticket type). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `k` tickets have been bought, and the total cost reflects the cumulative price increase. The function does not modify the input parameters. **
