The code snippet `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` increments the value of `price_increase` by the current value of `tickets_to_buy`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
- `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed.
- `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus the previous `total_cost`.
- `tickets_bought` is the previous `tickets_bought` plus the current `tickets_to_buy`.
- `price` is the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap plus `2 * price_increase`.
- `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap.
- `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `price_increase` is incremented by the current value of `tickets_to_buy`.

Therefore, the updated value of `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`, which simplifies to `2 * tickets_to_buy`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but with the smallest tuple removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus the previous `total_cost`. `tickets_bought` is the previous `tickets_bought` plus the current `tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the first element of the smallest tuple in the heap plus `2 * price_increase`. `day` is the second element of the smallest tuple in the heap. `price_increase` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**
