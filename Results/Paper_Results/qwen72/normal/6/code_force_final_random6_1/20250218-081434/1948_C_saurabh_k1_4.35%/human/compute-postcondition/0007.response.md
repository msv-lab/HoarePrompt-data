The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several variables and conditions:
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
  - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from an input string.
  - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from a new input string.
  - The string at index `n - 2` in `b` is not equal to `<`.

- However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **Yes**
