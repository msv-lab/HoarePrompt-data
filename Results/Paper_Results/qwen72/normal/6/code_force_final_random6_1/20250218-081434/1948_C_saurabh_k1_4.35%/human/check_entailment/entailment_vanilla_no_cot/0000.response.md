Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the bottom row (`b[n - 2]`) points to the left (`<`). This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` from the starting cell `(1, 1)`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. The robot starts at `(1, 1)`.
2. The robot must be able to move to the bottom row at some point.
3. Once in the bottom row, the robot must be able to reach the last cell `(2, n)`.

A more comprehensive approach would involve simulating the robot's movements or checking the conditions that allow the robot to reach the target cell. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is a way for the robot to move to the bottom row and then move to the last cell without getting stuck.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def can_reach_end():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can reach the bottom row
        can_reach_bottom = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == '>' and b[i] == '<':
                can_reach_bottom = True
                break
        
        # Check if the robot can reach the last cell in the bottom row
        can_reach_end = True
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            if b[i] == '<':
                can_reach_end = False
                break
        
        if can_reach_bottom and can_reach_end:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# can_reach_end()
```

This function correctly checks if the robot can reach the bottom row and then move to the last cell in the bottom row. It ensures that the robot can make the necessary moves to reach the target cell.
