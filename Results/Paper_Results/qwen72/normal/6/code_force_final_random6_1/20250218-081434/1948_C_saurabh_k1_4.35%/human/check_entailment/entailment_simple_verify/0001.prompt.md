You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) representing the number of columns in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of strings where each string is a character from the input string. The variable `_` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the final value of `_` is equal to the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, the output "No" was printed. Otherwise, the output "Yes" was printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a 2xN grid where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`).
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, N).
   - The robot moves every second in one of four directions (left, right, up, down) and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The robot must start at (1, 1) and eventually reach (2, N).
   - The robot's movement is constrained by the arrows in the grid.
   - The robot can only move to the right or down, and it must follow the arrow in the current cell.

3. **Critical Path**:
   - To reach (2, N), the robot must eventually move to the second row.
   - The robot can only move to the second row if it encounters a cell in the first row that points down (`>`), or if it moves down on its own.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move to the right until it reaches the last column (N).

4. **Condition for Reaching (2, N)**:
   - The robot can only reach (2, N) if it can move to the second row and then move to the right until it reaches the last column.
   - The key condition is that the second row must have a right-pointing arrow (`>`) in the second-to-last column (N-1). This is because the robot must be able to move from (2, N-1) to (2, N).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n`, the first row `a`, and the second row `b`.
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n-2]`) is a left-pointing arrow (`<`).
   - If it is, the program prints `No`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `Yes`.

6. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program only checks the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n-2]`).
   - This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, N) because the robot must also be able to move to the second row from the first row.
   - The program does not check if there is a way for the robot to move from the first row to the second row.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks the second-to-last cell in the second row, which is not enough to determine if the robot can reach (2, N). The robot must also be able to move from the first row to the second row, and this condition is not checked in the program.

### Correctness:
**False**
