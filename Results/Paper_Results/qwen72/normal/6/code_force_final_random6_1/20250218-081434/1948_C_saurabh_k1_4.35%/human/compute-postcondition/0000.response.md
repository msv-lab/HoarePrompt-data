The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is a valid integer and that it is greater than 0, as this will determine the number of iterations.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
