Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, and `_` is incremented by 1, with `n` being greater than `_`.
- The code snippet `b = list(map(str, input()))` updates the value of `b` to a new list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string provided by the user.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `_`) and conditions remain unchanged.
- The condition about the element at index `n - 2` in `b` being the string `"<"` or not is still valid, but the actual value of `b` has been updated.
