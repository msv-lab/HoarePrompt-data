The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
  - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from a new input string.
  - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from a new input string.
  - If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.
  - `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are used in the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and does not reference any of the variables or conditions described.

### Output:
Output: **No**
