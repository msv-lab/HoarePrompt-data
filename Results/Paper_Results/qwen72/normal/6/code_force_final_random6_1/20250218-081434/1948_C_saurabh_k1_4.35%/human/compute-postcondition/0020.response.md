The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes the variables and objects that exist before the code is executed, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **No**
