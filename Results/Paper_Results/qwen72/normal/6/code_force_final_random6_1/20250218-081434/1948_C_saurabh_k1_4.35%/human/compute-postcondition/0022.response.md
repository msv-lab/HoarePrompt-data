Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to the string "<", the postcondition remains the same. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same.***
