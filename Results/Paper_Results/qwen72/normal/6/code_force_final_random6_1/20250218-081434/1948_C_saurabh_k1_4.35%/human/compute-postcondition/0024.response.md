The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, representing the number of columns in each test case. The list of tuples contains pairs of strings, each string of length n and consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines whether it is possible to make all arrows point in the same direction by flipping any number of columns. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` representing the number of columns in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list of results, each indicating "Yes" if it is possible to make all arrows point in the same direction by flipping columns, or "No" otherwise.**
