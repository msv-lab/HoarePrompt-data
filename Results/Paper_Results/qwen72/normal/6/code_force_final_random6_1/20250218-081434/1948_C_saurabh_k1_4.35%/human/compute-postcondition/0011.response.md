Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of strings, where each string is a character from the new input string.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings from the input string, `b` is a list of strings from the new input string, and `_` is incremented by 1 with `n` being greater than `_`.
- The condition about the element at index `n - 2` in `b` being `"<"` or not remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` and `_` are not modified by the code, so their conditions remain the same.
- The initial state of `a` is overridden by the new input, so the new value of `a` is a list of strings from the new input string.
