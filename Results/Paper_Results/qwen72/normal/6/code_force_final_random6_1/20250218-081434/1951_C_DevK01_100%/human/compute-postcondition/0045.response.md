Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the first integer in `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `cost` and `N` are not yet defined, and `mu` is not yet defined.**

Explanation:
- `q` is assigned the value of the ceiling of `k / m`. Since `k` is the third integer in `L` and `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of `k / m`.
- The values of `L`, `t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `cost` and `N` are still not defined.
- `mu` is still not defined.
