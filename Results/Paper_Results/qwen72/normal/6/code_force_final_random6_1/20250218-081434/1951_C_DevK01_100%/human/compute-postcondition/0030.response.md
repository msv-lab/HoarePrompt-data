Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated to `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
