Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the total cost. Specifically, the way it handles the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a day is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for the increased prices on subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost After Purchasing Tickets**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost by sorting the prices and then selecting the first `q` days. However, it does not correctly handle the price increase for subsequent days.
   - The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to account for the price increase, but it is not applied correctly. This formula calculates the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers, which is not the correct way to handle the price increase.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**:
   - The program pops the last element from the sorted list `N` and calculates the cost for the remaining tickets. However, it does not correctly update the prices for the subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Price Increase**:
   - The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days, not just a fixed formula. The program needs to dynamically update the prices for each day based on the number of tickets purchased.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the prices in ascending order
        prices.sort()
        
        # Initialize the total cost
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Initialize the number of tickets to buy
        tickets_to_buy = k
        
        # Initialize the day counter
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_to_buy > 0:
            # Determine the number of tickets to buy on this day
            tickets_today = min(m, tickets_to_buy)
            
            # Calculate the cost for today
            total_cost += tickets_today * prices[day]
            
            # Update the prices for subsequent days
            for i in range(day + 1, n):
                prices[i] += tickets_today
            
            # Decrease the number of tickets to buy
            tickets_to_buy -= tickets_today
            
            # Move to the next day
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_tickets()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure that we buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

2. **Dynamic Price Update**:
   - For each day, the program calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_today`), which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets per day) and `tickets_to_buy` (the remaining tickets to buy).
   - The cost for the current day is added to `total_cost`.
   - The prices for all subsequent days are increased by `tickets_today`.
   - The number of tickets to buy is decreased by `tickets_today`.
   - The program moves to the next day.

3. **Output**:
   - The total cost is printed for each test case.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output.
