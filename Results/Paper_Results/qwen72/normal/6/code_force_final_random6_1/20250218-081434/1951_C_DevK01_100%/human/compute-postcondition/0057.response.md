Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, and `mu` is not defined. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following conditions hold:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process.
- The variable `_` is `t - 1`, which means it has reached the value of `t - 1` after the last iteration.
- The variable `L` is a list of integers provided by the user for the last test case.
- The variable `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user for the last test case.
- The variable `n` is the number of elements in the list `N` for the last test case.
- The variable `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L` for the last test case.
- The variable `k` is the third integer in `L` for the last test case.
- The variable `q` is the ceiling of `k / m` for the last test case.
- The list `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k` for the last test case. Otherwise, `N` contains the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
- The variable `cost` is calculated based on the conditions described in the loop:
  - If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
  - If `n * m != k`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `w` is the last element of the original `N` and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- The `continue` statement has no effect after the last iteration, as the loop has already completed.

All other variables and states that were not modified by the loop remain unchanged.
