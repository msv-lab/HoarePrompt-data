You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, and `mu` is not defined. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but continues to the next iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input, each consisting of a list `L` containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `M` of integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the sorted elements of `M` and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The cost is computed differently depending on whether `n * m` equals `k` or not. The function prints the cost for each test case and continues to the next one until all test cases are processed. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, and `cost` are in the final state as described in the annotated code for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the price increase correctly after purchasing tickets on a given day. According to the problem description, if you purchase \( x \) tickets on day \( i \), the prices for all subsequent days should increase by \( x \). However, the program does not update the prices for subsequent days after each purchase, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
The expected output is 1, as you can purchase 1 ticket on the second day with the minimum cost of 1. However, the program will not correctly handle the price increase after each purchase, leading to an incorrect result.

Another example:
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
The expected output is 10. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket on the third day (cost 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (cost 6), resulting in a total cost of 10. However, the program does not correctly handle the price increase after each purchase, which can lead to an incorrect result.

The program needs to be modified to correctly update the prices for subsequent days after each purchase to ensure it meets the problem description's requirements.
