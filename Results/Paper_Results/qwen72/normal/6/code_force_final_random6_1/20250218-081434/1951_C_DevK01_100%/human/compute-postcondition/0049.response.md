Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the number of elements in `N` minus 1, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` and `mu` are not yet defined.**

The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The length of `N` is now reduced by 1, so `n` is the number of elements in `N` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
