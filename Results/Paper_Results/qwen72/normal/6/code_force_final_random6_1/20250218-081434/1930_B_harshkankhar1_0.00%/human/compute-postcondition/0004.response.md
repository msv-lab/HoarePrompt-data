Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and prints a permutation of length `n` where the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed, and the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) remain in their original order. The function does not return any value. **
