### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program constructs a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which is a valid permutation of length `n`.

3. **Reversing Even Indices:**
   - The program then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a` using the slice assignment `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`. This means that the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed while the elements at odd indices remain in their original order.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified list `a`, which is the permutation.

5. **Validation of Permutation:**
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the permutation does not have the property where both `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any `i` and `j` with `i < j`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 3 correctly. For `n = 3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is valid, and the program will output `[3, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 3]` depending on the input, both of which are valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation of length `n` and ensures that the condition `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` is not satisfied for any distinct indices `i` and `j`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
