Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one integer, `c` is the first integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.**

The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the first integer in `s`, if `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` becomes 1, and if `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
