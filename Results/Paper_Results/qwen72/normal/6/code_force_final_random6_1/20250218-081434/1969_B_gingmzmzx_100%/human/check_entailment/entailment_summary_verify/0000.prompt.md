You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` binary strings, it reads a string `s` from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans`. This value `ans` represents the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the string plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the string. The function then prints `ans` for each binary string. After processing all `n` strings, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to count transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1', but it does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all cases.

For example, consider the input string "101011":
- The program will output 5, which is the correct answer.
- However, for the input string "01101001", the program will output 11, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 7.

The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '1's to the right of all '0's. This can be done by counting the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's to achieve a sorted string. The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
