The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` binary strings, it reads a string `s` from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans`. This value `ans` represents the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the string plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the string. The function then prints `ans` for each binary string. After processing all `n` strings, the function concludes.
