Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in `s`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 1] if the first element was 0 and `c` is 1, or [1, 0] if the first element was 0 and `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if the first element was 1 and `c` is 1, or [1, 1] if the first element was 1 and `c` is 0, `ans` is 0 if the first element was 0 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` if the first element was 1, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s` which is at least 1.**
