You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with the last `n` elements, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the final `s`, number of 1s in the final `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the final `s` plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the final `s`, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the final `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is expected to accept a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The function's output is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
