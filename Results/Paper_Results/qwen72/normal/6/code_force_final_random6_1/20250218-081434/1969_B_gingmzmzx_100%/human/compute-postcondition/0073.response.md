To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is a list of integers derived from a new input string.
- `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in `s` plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in `s`.
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- For each 0 in `s`, count the number of 1s that appear after it.
- For each 1 in `s`, count the number of 0s that appear after it.
- Sum these counts to get `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Count the number of 0s and 1s in `s`**:
   - `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.

2. **Calculate the number of 1s that appear after each 0**:
   - For each 0 in `s`, count the number of 1s that appear after it in the list.
   - This can be done by iterating through the list and for each 0, summing the number of 1s from the current position to the end of the list.

3. **Calculate the number of 0s that appear after each 1**:
   - For each 1 in `s`, count the number of 0s that appear after it in the list.
   - This can be done by iterating through the list and for each 1, summing the number of 0s from the current position to the end of the list.

4. **Sum these counts to get `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the total sum of the counts from steps 2 and 3.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example list `s = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`:
- `cnt[0] = 3` (number of 0s)
- `cnt[1] = 3` (number of 1s)

For each 0 in `s`:
- The first 0: 1s after it are [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] → 3 ones
- The second 0: 1s after it are [1, 1, 0] → 2 ones
- The third 0: 1s after it are [0] → 0 ones

Total number of 1s after 0s: 3 + 2 + 0 = 5

For each 1 in `s`:
- The first 1: 0s after it are [0, 1, 1, 0] → 2 zeros
- The second 1: 0s after it are [1, 0] → 1 zero
- The third 1: 0s after it are [0] → 1 zero

Total number of 0s after 1s: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, `ans = 5 + 4 = 9`.

### General Output:
Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in `s` plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in `s`)**
