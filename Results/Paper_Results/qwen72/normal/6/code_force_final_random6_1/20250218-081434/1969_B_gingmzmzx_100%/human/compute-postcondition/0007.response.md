The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the first element of `s`, the specific index in `cnt` that is incremented depends on the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in `s`, `cnt` is a list with values [0, 0] where `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 0.**
