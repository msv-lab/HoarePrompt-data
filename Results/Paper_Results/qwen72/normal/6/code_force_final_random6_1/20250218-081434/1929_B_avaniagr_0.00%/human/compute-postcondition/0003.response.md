The only objects in the loop head are the list `[*open(0)][1:]` and the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `[*open(0)][1:]` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `[*open(0)][1:]` must be a list containing at least one element, and `s` is the first element in this list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `[*open(0)][1:]` must contain at least two elements, and `s` will be the second element in this list.

State: **`[*open(0)][1:]` must be a list containing at least two elements, `s` is the second element in the list, `n` is the first integer in `s` after splitting by spaces, `k` is the second integer in `s` after splitting by spaces.**
