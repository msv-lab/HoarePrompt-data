Output State: **`func_1` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `neg` will hold the count of how many times the character '-' appears in the string `s`. The other variables (`func_1`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
