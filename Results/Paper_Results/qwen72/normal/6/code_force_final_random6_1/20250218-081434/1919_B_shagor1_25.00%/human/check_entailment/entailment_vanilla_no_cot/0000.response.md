Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which is a more complex problem involving the sum of subarrays and their lengths.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where each element is 1 for '+' and -1 for '-'.
2. Calculate the sum of all elements in `a`.
3. Determine the optimal way to split `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which involves considering the balance of positive and negative sums in the subarrays.

The given program does not perform these steps correctly and thus does not provide the correct minimum penalty for the given test cases. For example, for the input `"+-+-+-"`, the correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into subarrays with sums of zero, but the program would output `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reasons. For other cases, it would not produce the correct result.
