The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` must have at least one character, and `i` is the first character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least two characters. The variable `i` will then be set to the second character of `s`.

State: **`func_1` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is equal to '-', `neg` is set to 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0.**
