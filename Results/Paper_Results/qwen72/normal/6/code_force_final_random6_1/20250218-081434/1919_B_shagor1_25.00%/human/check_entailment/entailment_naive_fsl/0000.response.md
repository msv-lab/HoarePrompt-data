Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the penalty based on the number of '-' characters and the length of the string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
++--
```
The optimal way to split this string would be `([1, 1], [-1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `p([1, 1]) + p([-1, -1]) = 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 4 + 4 = 8`. However, the program calculates the penalty as `4 - 2 * 2 = 0`, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly implement the logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty, leading to incorrect results for many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
