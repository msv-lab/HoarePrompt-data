Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) and `arr` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `freq[i]` is now 1.** 

The value of `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `arr`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
