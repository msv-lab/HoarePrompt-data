Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the final state is as follows: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `i` is `n`, `cou` is 0, 1, or 2. If the loop did not break early, `cou` is 0 or 1, and no integer `j` in the range `[0, n]` has a frequency of 0 or 2. If the loop broke early, `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0 for some `i` in the range `[0, n]`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed its full range. The variable `cou` will be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the conditions encountered during the loop. If the loop did not break early, it means that no integer in the range `[0, n]` had a frequency of 0 or 2, and `cou` will be 0 or 1. If the loop broke early, it means that either `cou` reached 2 (indicating that two unique integers were found) or `freq[i]` was 0 for some `i` (indicating that an integer did not appear in `arr`), and the loop exited at that point.
