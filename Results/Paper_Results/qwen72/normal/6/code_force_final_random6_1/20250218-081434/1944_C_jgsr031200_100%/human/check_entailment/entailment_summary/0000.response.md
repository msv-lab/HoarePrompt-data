Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the MEX of the array `c` that is formed after Alice and Bob play their optimal moves. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies of both players:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she wants to ensure that the smallest possible non-negative integer does not appear in `c`. To do this, she should try to pick the smallest integers that appear only once in `a` and add them to `c`.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the score, which means he should try to prevent Alice from achieving her goal. Bob should pick the smallest integers that appear only once in `a` to remove them from the game, making it harder for Alice to form a `c` with a high MEX.

Given these strategies, the optimal play involves both players focusing on the smallest integers that appear only once. The program's logic is as follows:

- It initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- It iterates through the range `[0, n]` to find the first integer `i` that either:
  - Does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `freq[i] == 0`).
  - Appears exactly once in `arr` and is the second such integer (i.e., `cou == 2`).

This logic correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` that would be formed if both players play optimally. The program ensures that it prints the smallest integer that meets the criteria, which aligns with the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` prints the correct MEX value for the given examples and behaves as expected for valid inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
