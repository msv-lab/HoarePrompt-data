The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `arr` must be assigned to `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element in `arr`, and `freq[i]` was incremented to 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) and `arr` must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `freq[i]` is now 1 for the first element in `arr`**
