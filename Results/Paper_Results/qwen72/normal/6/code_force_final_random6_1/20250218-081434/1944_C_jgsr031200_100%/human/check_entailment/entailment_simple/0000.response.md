### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` and appending to another array `c` (only Alice appends to `c`).
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Frequency Calculation:**
     - The function initializes a frequency list `freq` of length `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
     - It iterates through `arr` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each element.
   - **Optimal Play Strategy:**
     - The function then iterates through the range `[0, n]` to find the MEX.
     - It keeps a counter `cou` to track the number of elements that appear exactly once in `arr`.
     - If an element appears at least twice, it continues to the next element.
     - If an element appears exactly once, it increments `cou`.
     - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an element does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:**
     - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include the smallest integers that appear exactly once in `arr` into `c`.
   - **Bob's Strategy:**
     - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to remove the smallest integers that appear exactly once in `arr` to prevent Alice from including them in `c`.
   - **Combined Strategy:**
     - The loop in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once and has been included in `c` by Alice.
     - The condition `if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0` ensures that the loop stops at the first integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once after Alice has included one such integer.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all integers from `0` to `n-1` appear at least once in `arr` by printing `n` (since the MEX would be `n` in this case).
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`.

### Correctness:
**True**
