To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head: `i` and `n`.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(n + 1)`, so the variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `cou` is 0 or 1.
   - `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Consider the break conditions**:
   - The loop will break if `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.
   - Since `cou` is 0 or 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it remains 0 or 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `freq[i]` is `freq[2]` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue if `freq[2]` is not 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `freq[2]` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.**
