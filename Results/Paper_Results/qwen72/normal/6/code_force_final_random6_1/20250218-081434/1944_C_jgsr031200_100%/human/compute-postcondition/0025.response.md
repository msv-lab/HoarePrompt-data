Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`.
   - The length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5).
   - `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.
   - `cou` is 0 or 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `freq[1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.
   - If `freq[i]` is equal to 1, `cou` is updated to 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cou` remains 0 or 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
