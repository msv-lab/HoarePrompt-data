Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing, the list `freq` will contain the frequency count of each integer in `arr`. Specifically, `freq[j]` will be the number of times the integer `j` appears in the list `arr`. The list `arr` itself remains unchanged.
