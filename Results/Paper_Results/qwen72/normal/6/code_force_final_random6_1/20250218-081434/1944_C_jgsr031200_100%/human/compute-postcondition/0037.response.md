The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies the condition 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The function returns a value based on the input list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the list's length is between 1 and 200,000. It returns a value based on the elements of the list.**
