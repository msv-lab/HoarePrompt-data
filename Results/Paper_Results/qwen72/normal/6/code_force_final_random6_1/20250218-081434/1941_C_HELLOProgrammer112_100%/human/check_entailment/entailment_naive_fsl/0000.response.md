Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of "mapie". However, this approach does not account for the fact that the substrings "map" and "pie" can overlap in different ways, and the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is not simply the sum of the counts of these substrings minus the count of "mapie".

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- It will also count 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- Therefore, the program will output 1 + 1 - 0 = 2.

However, the correct answer should be 1, because removing the 'p' at index 1 (0-based index) will make the string "maie", which is beautiful.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
