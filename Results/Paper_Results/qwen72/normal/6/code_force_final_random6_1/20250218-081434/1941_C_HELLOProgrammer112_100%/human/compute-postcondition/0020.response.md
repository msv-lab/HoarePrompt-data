To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(x + y - z)`, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored).
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.
   - `z` is the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` counts the occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` counts the occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
   - `z` counts the occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The expression `x + y - z` will be evaluated.
   - Each occurrence of 'mapie' in `s` will be counted in both `x` and `y` because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie'.
   - Therefore, `z` will be subtracted to correct for the double counting of 'mapie'.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in `s`, minus the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x + y - z`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the string s)**
