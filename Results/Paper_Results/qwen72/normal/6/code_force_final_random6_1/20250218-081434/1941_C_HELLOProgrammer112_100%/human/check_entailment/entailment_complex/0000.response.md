Reasoning:  
The program provided is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful by ensuring it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". However, the program simply counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then prints the result of `x + y - z`, which does not correspond to the minimum number of deletions required.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through the string and identify the positions of the substrings "pie" and "map".
2. Calculate the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings, ensuring that no "pie" or "map" remains in the string.

The provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the count of these substrings and their overlap (counted as "mapie") can be used to determine the deletions, which is not the case.

Correctness: **False**
