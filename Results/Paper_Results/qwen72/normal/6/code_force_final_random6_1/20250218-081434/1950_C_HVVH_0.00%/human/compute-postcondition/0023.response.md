Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `h` is `h - 12`, `m` is an integer derived from the input string `s`.**

The value of `h` is decreased by 12, while the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `h` is `h - 12`, and `m` is still an integer derived from the input string `s`.
