Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`.** 

The values of `t`, `s`, `day`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `h` and `m` are now integers representing the hours and minutes from the input string `s` respectively.
