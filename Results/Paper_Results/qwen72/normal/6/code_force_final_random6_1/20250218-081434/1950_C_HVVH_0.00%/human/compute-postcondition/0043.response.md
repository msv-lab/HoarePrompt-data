Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `n-1`, `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`. If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440.
- The variable `s` remains a string in the format "hh:mm".
- The variable `n` is now 0 or greater (it has been fully decremented by the loop).
- The variable `_` is `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
- The variables `h` and `m` are derived from the input string `s` and are updated in each iteration based on the conditions in the loop.
- The variable `day` is updated to 'AM' if `h` is 0 or 12, and to 'PM' if `h` is greater than 12. If `h` is less than or equal to 12 and not 0, `day` remains 'PM'.
