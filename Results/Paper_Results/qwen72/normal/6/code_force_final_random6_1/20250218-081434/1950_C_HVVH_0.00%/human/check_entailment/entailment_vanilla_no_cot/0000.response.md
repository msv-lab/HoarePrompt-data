Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in determining whether the time should be marked as 'AM' or 'PM'. Specifically, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' is incorrect. The program sets `day` to 'PM' for any hour greater than 12, but it also incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for hours 12 and below, which should be 'AM' except for the hour 12 in the afternoon. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h = h - 12
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected version properly handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format and correctly sets the 'AM' or 'PM' indicator based on the hour.
