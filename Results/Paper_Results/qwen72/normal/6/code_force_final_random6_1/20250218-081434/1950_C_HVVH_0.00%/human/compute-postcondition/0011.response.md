Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`, and `h` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `h` is less than or equal to 12.**
