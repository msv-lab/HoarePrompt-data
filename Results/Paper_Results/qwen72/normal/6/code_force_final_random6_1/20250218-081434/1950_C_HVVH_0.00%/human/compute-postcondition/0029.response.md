Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`. If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.***
