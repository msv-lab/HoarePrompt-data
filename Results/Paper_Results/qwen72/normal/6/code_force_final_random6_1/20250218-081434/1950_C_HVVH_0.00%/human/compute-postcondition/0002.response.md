The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `s`, and `day` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
