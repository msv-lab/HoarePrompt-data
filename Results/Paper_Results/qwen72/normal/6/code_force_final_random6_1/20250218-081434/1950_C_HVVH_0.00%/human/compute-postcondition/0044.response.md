The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59. Based on the provided information, the function should return a value or values depending on these inputs, but the specific return values are not detailed in the given output. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is from 00 to 23 and `mm` is from 00 to 59).**
