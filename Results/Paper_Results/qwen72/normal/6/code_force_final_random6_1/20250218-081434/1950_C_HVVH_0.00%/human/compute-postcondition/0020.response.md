Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`.** 

The values of `h` and `m` are now integers derived from the input string `s`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `h` and `m` based on the initial state of `s` are still valid.
