Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the hour is exactly 12. According to the problem description, 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, which results in the wrong output. For example, for the input "12:00", the program will output "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM".
