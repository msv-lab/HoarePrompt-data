Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `day` is 'PM', `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is an integer derived from the input string `s` and is now equal to the original value of `h` minus 12, and `m` is an integer derived from the input string `s`.**

The code snippet changes the value of the variable `day` to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
