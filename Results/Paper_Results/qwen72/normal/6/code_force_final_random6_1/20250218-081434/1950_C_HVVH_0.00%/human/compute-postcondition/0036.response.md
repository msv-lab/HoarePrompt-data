Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `h` is `h - 12`, `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`, `day` is 'PM'.**

The variable `day` is now set to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
