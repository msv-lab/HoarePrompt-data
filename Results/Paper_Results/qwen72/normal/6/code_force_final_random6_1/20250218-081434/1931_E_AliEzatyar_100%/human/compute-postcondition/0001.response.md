The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `num`. The loop starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(num)` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `counter` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly.

To ensure the loop executes, the list `num` must have at least one element, and `i` must start at `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `counter` is 0**
