The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates backward from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the loop body was executed for the last element of `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and the condition `i >= 0` must still hold true. This means `i` should be `len(num) - 2` for the next iteration. The list `num` must still have at least one element for `i` to be within the valid range.

Given that the last element of `num` is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the state of `counter` and the last element of `num` do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and if the second last element of `num` is '0', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 0, and the second last element of `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
