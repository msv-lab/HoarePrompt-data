### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `total_digits`.
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using `func_1` and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of digits that can be removed by Anna by summing every second element in the `zeros` list. This is incorrect because Anna can reverse any number of elements, and the number of trailing zeros removed should be the sum of all trailing zeros, not just every second element.
   - The correct approach should be to sum all elements in the `zeros` list to get the total number of trailing zeros that can be removed by Anna.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`. This is incorrect because the game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the winning condition should be based on the final number of digits, not the absolute difference.
   - The correct condition should be to check if the total number of digits after removing trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number represented as a string.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    total_zeros = sum(zeros)
    if total_digits - total_zeros >= m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the calculation of `subtract_zero` and the winning condition.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the total number of trailing zeros and uses the correct winning condition.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
