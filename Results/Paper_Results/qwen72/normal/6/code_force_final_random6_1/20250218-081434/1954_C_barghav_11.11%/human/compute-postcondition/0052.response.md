Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns no values. It reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits from 1 to 9. The function then modifies these strings such that for the first half of the strings, each character in the first string is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original strings, and each character in the second string is the minimum. For the second half of the strings, the opposite occurs: each character in the first string is the minimum, and each character in the second string is the maximum. Finally, the function prints the modified first string, followed by a newline, then the modified second string, and another newline. The input variables `t`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by the function. **
