Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 2, `n` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[2]` is set to `m` and `b[2]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `a[2]` is set to `n` and `b[2]` is set to `m`.**
