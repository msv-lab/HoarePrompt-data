Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 1, `n` is the smaller of `a[1]` and `b[1]` (both characters are digits from 1 to 9), `m` is the larger of `a[1]` and `b[1]` (both characters are digits from 1 to 9), `a[1]` is now equal to `m`, `b[1]` is now equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[1]` is updated to `n`, which is the smaller of `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
- The value of `a[1]` is already updated to `m`, which is the larger of `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
