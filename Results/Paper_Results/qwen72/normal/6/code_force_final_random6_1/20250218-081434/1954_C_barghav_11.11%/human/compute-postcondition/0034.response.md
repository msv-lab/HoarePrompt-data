Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. After the loop, for the first half of the list (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`. For the second half of the list (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`.**
