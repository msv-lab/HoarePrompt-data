Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This indicates the number of test cases.
   - `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\). This means `x` and `y` are very large integers, but they are within the specified range.
   - `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. This means the integers `x` and `y` do not contain the digit 0.
   - `a` is a list of characters from the input string. This suggests that `a` is derived from a string representation of `x` or `y`.
   - `b` is a list of characters from a new input string that must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements. This means `b` is longer than `a` by at least one character.
   - `i` is `len(a) + 1`. This means `i` is the index of the first character in `b` that is beyond the length of `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(b[i], end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is trying to print the character at index `i` in the list `b`.
   - Since `i` is `len(a) + 1`, it points to the character in `b` that is just beyond the length of `a`.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will not be followed by a newline, but will be printed in the same line.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The character at index `i` in `b` is the `(len(a) + 1)`-th character in `b`.
   - Since `b` is guaranteed to have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, the character at index `i` is well-defined and will be printed.

Therefore, the output will be the character at the index `len(a) + 1` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[len(a) + 1] (where b is a list of characters from a new input string and len(a) is the length of the list a)**
