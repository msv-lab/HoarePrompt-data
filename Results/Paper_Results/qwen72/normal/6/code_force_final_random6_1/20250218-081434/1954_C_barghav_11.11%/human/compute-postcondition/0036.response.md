Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
   - `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character.
   - `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], end='')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of the list `a` will be printed.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after the printed character, so the output will be a single character followed by no additional characters.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the first character of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first character of the list `a`)**
