Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and `i` is 0. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a[0]` is now `m`, and `b[0]` is now `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to half the length of `a`, `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (as characters), `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (as characters), `a[i]` is now equal to `n`, and `b[i]` is now equal to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 1, `n` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `m` is the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[1]` is set to `m` and `b[1]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `a[1]` is set to `n` and `b[1]` is set to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 2, `n` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, then `a[2]` is set to `m` and `b[2]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `a[2]` is set to `n` and `b[2]` is set to `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
