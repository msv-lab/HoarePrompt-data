Reasoning:  
The function `func` reads the number of test cases `test` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

The key logic in the function is the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. This condition checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. The bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1` is used to determine the parity of the sum:
- If `a + b & 1 == 0`, the sum is even.
- If `a + b & 1 == 1`, the sum is odd.

The game's outcome is determined by the parity of the sum of the coins:
- If the sum is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

This logic is based on the fact that each player must remove one coin from their wallet on each turn, and the player who cannot make a move loses. Since the game is symmetric and both players play optimally, the player who starts with a wallet that has an odd number of coins (or the total number of coins is odd) will always have the last move and thus win the game.

The function correctly implements this logic and outputs "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd. The function also handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

However, the function definition does not explicitly take `a` and `b` as parameters, which is inconsistent with the initial comment. Despite this, the function works correctly as it reads the inputs directly from `input()` within the loop.

Given the problem description and the provided function, the function is correct in terms of its logic and output.

Correctness: **True**
