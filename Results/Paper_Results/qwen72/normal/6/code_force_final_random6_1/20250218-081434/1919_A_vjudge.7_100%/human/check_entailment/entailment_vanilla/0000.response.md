### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Alice and Bob each have a certain number of coins in their wallets, represented by `a` and `b` respectively.
   - Alice makes the first move.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`.

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is even, Bob will always win.
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is odd, Alice will always win.

#### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins:**
  - If `a + b` is even, the game will always end in an even number of moves.
  - Since Alice makes the first move, Bob will make the last move.
  - Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and eventually, Bob will be the one to make the final move when both wallets are empty.

- **Odd Total Coins:**
  - If `a + b` is odd, the game will always end in an odd number of moves.
  - Since Alice makes the first move, Alice will make the last move.
  - Alice will always be able to make a move after Bob, and eventually, Alice will be the one to make the final move when both wallets are empty.

#### Code Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
- It then checks the parity of `a + b` using the bitwise AND operator `&`.
  - `a + b & 1 == 0` checks if `a + b` is even.
  - If `a + b` is even, it prints "Bob".
  - If `a + b` is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Bitwise AND Operator:
- The expression `a + b & 1` is equivalent to checking the least significant bit of `a + b`.
- If the least significant bit is 0, `a + b` is even.
- If the least significant bit is 1, `a + b` is odd.

#### Correctness:
- The logic implemented in the code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
