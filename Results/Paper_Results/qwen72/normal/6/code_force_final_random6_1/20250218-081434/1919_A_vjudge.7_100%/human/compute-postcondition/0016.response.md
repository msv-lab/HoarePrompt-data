Based on the initial state provided:

- `func` is a function that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `test` is an integer such that \(1 \leq test \leq 1000\).
- `t` is set to 2.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- The function `func` does not change the state of the variables regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'Alice' to the console. The values of `a`, `b`, `test`, and `t` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **Alice**
