Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The logic in the program is based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's why the logic works:

1. **Turns and Moves**: Each player, starting with Alice, can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then they must remove 1 coin from their wallet. The game continues until a player cannot make a move (i.e., their wallet is empty).

2. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses. This means the player who is forced to make a move when both wallets are empty loses.

3. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the game will end with both wallets being empty at the same time. Since Alice starts, Bob will be the one to make the last move and win.
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, the game will end with one wallet having 1 coin left and the other being empty. Alice will be the one to make the last move and win.

The program checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is consistent with the problem's requirements and the provided examples.

Therefore, the program is correct.
