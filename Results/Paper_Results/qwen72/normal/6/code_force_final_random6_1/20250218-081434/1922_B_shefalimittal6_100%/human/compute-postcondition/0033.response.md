The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
