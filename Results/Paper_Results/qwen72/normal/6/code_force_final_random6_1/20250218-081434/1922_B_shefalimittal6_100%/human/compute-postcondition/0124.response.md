Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` updates the value of `ans`.
- `v[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `v`.
- `i` is 2, so `v[i]` is `v[2]`.
- `v[2]` is initially `n` (since `v[x]` is incremented by `n` and `x` is `2`).
- The expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` evaluates to `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.
- `ans` is updated by adding this value to its current value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
