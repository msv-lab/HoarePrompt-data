Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `v[x]` is now 1, `x` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of the string at `data[3]`.
- The initial state specifies that `idx` is 3, so `data[3]` is the string at index 3 of the `data` list.
- The value of `x` is now the integer conversion of `data[3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
