Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` does not change the value of `ans` because it was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
