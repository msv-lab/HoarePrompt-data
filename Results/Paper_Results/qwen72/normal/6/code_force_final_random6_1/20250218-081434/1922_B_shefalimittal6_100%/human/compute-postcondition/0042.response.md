The code snippet `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` updates the value of `ans` based on the value of `v[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `v[i]` is `v[2]`. The value of `v[2]` is 0 (since `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `n` is greater than 0).

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:
- `v[2]` is 0.
- `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` becomes `0 * (0 - 1) * (0 - 2) // 6`, which simplifies to `0`.

Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding 0 to its current value, meaning `ans` remains unchanged.

The other variables and conditions remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
