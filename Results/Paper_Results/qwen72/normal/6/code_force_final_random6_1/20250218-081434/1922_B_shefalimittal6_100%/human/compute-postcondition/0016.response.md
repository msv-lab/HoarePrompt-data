Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `v[x]` is now 1, `x` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
