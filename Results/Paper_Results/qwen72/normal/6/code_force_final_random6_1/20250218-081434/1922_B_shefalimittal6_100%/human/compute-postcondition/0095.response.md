Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + 5`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 1, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `v` by 1.
- The initial value of `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- After the code execution, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `v[x]` is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
