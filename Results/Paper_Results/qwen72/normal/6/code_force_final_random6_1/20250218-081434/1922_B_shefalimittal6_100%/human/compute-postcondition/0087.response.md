The code `results.append(str(ans))` appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. This means that `results` will now contain one additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triplets of elements in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.**
