Output State: **The function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The `input` function is now set to `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string.**

This means that the function's parameters and their constraints remain unchanged, but the `input` function now reads the entire input at once as a single string.
