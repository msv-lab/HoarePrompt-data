Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.** 

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it is now `n + 4`. The initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.
