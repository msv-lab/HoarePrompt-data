Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `v[x]` is incremented by the number of times the corresponding integer `x` appears in `data` from index 2 to `n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, calculated based on the counts in `v`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- **`idx`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still `n + 2`.
- **`data`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still a list of strings.
- **`results`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still an empty list.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
- **`v`**: This list is updated such that each element `v[x]` is incremented by the number of times the integer `x` appears in the `data` list from index 2 to `n + 1`.
- **`cnt`**: This variable is updated to be the sum of all elements in the `v` list, representing the total count of all integers from 2 to `n + 1` in `data`.
- **`i`**: This variable is updated to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- **`ans`**: This variable is updated to the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same. Specifically, for each integer `x` in the range from 0 to `n`, if `v[x]` is at least 2, the number of pairs of `x` is added to `ans`. If `v[x]` is at least 3, the number of triplets of `x` is also added to `ans`. The pairs and triplets are calculated using the combination formulas `v[x] * (v[x] - 1) // 2` and `v[x] * (v[x] - 1) * (v[x] - 2) // 6`, respectively.
