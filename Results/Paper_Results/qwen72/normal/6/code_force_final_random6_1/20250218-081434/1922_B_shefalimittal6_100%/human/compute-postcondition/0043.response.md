Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1]`. If `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + (cnt * v[2] * (v[2] - 1) // 2)`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` remains unchanged.***
