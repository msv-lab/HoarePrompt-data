Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
- Given `cnt` is 0, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` evaluates to 0.
- Therefore, `ans` remains 0 after the execution of the code.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
