Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1] + v[2] + v[2]`, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. If `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by `v[i]`, which is `v[2]` since `i` is 2.
- The new value of `cnt` is `cnt + v[1] + v[2] + v[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
