Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `l` is a non-empty list.**

The value of `bets` is updated to an input integer greater than 0, while the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
