Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`.
- Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`.
- The value of `a[0]` was previously updated to `prod // a[0]`.
- The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `a[j]` for all `j`, `sumo`, and `prod`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `ans` being an empty string is updated to contain the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.
