Postcondition: ***`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.***
