Postcondition: **`sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.**
