Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list. The input list `l` must contain at least one element, and each element must be an integer. After the function concludes, the variable `g` holds the LCM of the elements in `l`, and the original list `l` remains unchanged. **
