Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `bets` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides context about the variables `bets`, `i`, `a`, `prod`, and `sumo`, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
   - The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **-1**
