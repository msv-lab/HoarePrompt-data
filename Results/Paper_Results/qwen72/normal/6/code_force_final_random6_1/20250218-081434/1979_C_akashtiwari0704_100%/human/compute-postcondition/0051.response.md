Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in the list. The function updates the variable `g` to the LCM of the elements in `l` by iteratively calculating the product of each element divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g`. After the function concludes, `g` holds the LCM of the elements in `l`. **
