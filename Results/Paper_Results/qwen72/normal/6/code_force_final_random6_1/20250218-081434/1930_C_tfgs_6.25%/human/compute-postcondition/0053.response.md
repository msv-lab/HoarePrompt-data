Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `i` is `i + adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `counter[a[i - 1]] - 2 * adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - total_adv - adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]`, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is `counter[a[i]] - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`, `ans` has `total_adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `total_adv` is the sum of all `adv` values from each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The code `counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv` decreases the value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` by `adv`.
- Since `counter[a[i - 1]]` was already decreased by `adv` in the initial state, it is now decreased by `2 * adv`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
