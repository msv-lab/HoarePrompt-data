Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n`, and these additional elements are the largest possible integers that can be inserted between the elements of `a` without violating the uniqueness and descending order.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n`, and these additional elements are the largest possible integers that can be inserted between the elements of `a` without violating the uniqueness and descending order. The last element of `ans` is now `ans[-2] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 2`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
