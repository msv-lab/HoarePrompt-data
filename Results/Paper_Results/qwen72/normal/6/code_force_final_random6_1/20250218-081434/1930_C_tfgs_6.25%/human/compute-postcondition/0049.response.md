The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `adv` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than `j`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 2.
- `adv` remains the same and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]`, `j` is 2, `counter[a[i]]` is `counter[a[i]] - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`, `adv` must be greater than 1, `ans` has `adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` now includes the value `a[i - 1] - 2` appended to it.**
