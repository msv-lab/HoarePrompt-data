The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a` with its length `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2**
