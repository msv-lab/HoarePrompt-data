Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`.** 

The list `a` is now a list of unique integers, as duplicates have been removed. The length of the list `a` may have decreased, but the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The `counter` object still contains the frequencies of the integers in the original list `a`.
