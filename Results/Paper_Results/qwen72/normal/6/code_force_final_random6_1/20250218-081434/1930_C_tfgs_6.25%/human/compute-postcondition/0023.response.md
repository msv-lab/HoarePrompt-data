Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is equal to `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`, `j` is `adv - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of unique integers, each within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The `counter` object still contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`.
- The variable `cnt` remains equal to `n - len(a)`.
- The list `ans` now contains `adv` elements, which are the integers `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., down to `a[i - 1] - adv`.
- The variable `i` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`.
- The loop variable `j` has completed its range, and its final value is `adv - 1`.
