Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. If `v` is 0 or `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` is executed.
- If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it is removed from `remaining_vertices`.
- `v` is also appended to `path`.
- If `v` is 0 or `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the code will raise an error or have no effect, respectively, and `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `d` are not affected by this code.
- The value of `u` is not affected by this code.
