To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - `d`: This variable is the loop counter and is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n`: This variable defines the range of the loop and remains constant throughout the loop.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `d` is `n - 1`.
   - `path` contains the vertex `v` if `v` was not 0 and was added.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and `v` (if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`).
   - `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and the loop breaks.
   - If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program proceeds without any changes to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `d` is still within the range defined by `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - The loop counter `d` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

### Adjusted State:

- `d` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `d` is `n - 2`.
- `n` remains the same, so \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

### Final State:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` contains the vertex `v` if `v` was not 0 and was added, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and `v` (if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`), `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` after the if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program proceeds without any changes to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.**
