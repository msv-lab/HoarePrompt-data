Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is -1, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any).**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`d`**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `d` will have been decremented from `n - 1` down to -1.
- **`path`**: The loop appends a vertex `v` to `path` only if `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. Since the loop breaks after the first successful addition of `v` to `path`, `path` will contain at most one vertex.
- **`remaining_vertices`**: If a vertex `v` was added to `path`, it is removed from `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. The set will still contain the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any).
