Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is 0 or not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.***
