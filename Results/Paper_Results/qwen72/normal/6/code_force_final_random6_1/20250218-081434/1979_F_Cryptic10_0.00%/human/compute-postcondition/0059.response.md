To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```
This loop will iterate over the values of `d` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `d` (which is `n - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (`-1`).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5
- `d` is -1
- `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added)
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The key variable in the loop head is `d`, and the range function will start from `n - 1` and go down to `0` (inclusive). Therefore, `d` must be set to `n - 1` for the loop to start.

The adjusted state should be:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5
- `d` is `n - 1`
- `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added)
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty**
