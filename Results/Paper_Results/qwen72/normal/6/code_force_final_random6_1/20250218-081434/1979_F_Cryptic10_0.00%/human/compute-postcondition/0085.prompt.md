Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is -1, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains the vertex `v` if `v` was not 0 and was added, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and `v` (if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`), `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` after the if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program proceeds without any changes to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and `v` is appended to `path`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is 0, or if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and appended to `path`. If `v` is 0 or `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
