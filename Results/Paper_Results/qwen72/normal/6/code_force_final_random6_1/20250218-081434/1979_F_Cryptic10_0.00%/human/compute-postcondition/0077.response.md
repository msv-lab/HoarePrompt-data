The only variables in the loop head are `d` and `n`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop iterates over `d` starting from `n - 1` and decreases `d` by 1 each time until `d` is -1. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is `n - 2` and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, `d` will be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `d` is greater than or equal to 0. Thus, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and `v` is appended to `path`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is 0, or if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
