### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The input parsing is correctly implemented. The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, storing them in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

3. **Loop Through Array:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` (which is equivalent to `x - num % x`).
     - `mod_y = num % y`.
   - It then adds the counts of pairs that satisfy the conditions to `count`:
     - `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` gives the count of elements that, when added to `num`, result in a sum divisible by `x`.
     - `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` gives the count of elements that, when subtracted from `num`, result in a difference divisible by `y`.
   - It updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key = num % x` and `mod_y_key = num % y`.
     - It increments the counts in the dictionaries for these remainders.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the `count` of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issues in the Original Assessment:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `mod_x`:**
  - The original assessment correctly identified that the calculation `mod_x = -num % x` can result in a negative remainder, which is not what we want. The correct calculation should be `mod_x = (x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is non-negative. However, the original program's approach of using `-num % x` is actually correct in Python because the `%` operator in Python always returns a non-negative remainder. Therefore, this part of the assessment is incorrect.

- **Incorrect Counting of Pairs:**
  - The original assessment stated that the program incorrectly adds the counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` directly and does not account for pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. However, the program does not add the counts directly; it adds the counts of elements that have already been processed and satisfy the conditions with the current element. This approach is correct because it ensures that each pair is counted only once.
  - The original assessment suggested a brute-force approach to count pairs, which is not necessary and would be inefficient for large inputs.

### Correctness of the Original Program:

- The original program correctly calculates the remainders and counts the pairs where both conditions are satisfied.
- The use of dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` ensures that the program efficiently counts the pairs without needing to use a brute-force approach.
- The program handles the input and output correctly and efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the reasoning above, the original program is correct. The issues identified in the original assessment were based on misunderstandings of Python's modulo operation and the counting mechanism.

Final: **True**
