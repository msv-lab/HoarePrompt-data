Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program accumulates the count of pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly adds the counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` without ensuring that both conditions (`a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`) are satisfied simultaneously for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\).

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
The beautiful pairs should be \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\) and \(\langle 2, 4 \rangle\):
- \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3\) (divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_2 = 1 - 2 = -1\) (not divisible by 2).
- \(\langle 2, 4 \rangle\): \(a_2 + a_4 = 2 + 5 = 7\) (not divisible by 3) and \(a_2 - a_4 = 2 - 5 = -3\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program will incorrectly count these pairs because it does not check both conditions together. It only checks the conditions separately and adds the counts, leading to incorrect results.
