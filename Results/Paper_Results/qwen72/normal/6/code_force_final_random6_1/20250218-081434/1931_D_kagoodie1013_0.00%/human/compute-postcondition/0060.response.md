Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `count` is the sum of all the values added during the loop iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys representing the unique remainders of `-num % x` for all elements in `arr` and values representing the count of each remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for all elements in `arr` and values representing the count of each remainder, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**
