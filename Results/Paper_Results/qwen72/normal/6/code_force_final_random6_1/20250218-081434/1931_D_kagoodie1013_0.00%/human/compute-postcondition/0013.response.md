The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` will be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**
