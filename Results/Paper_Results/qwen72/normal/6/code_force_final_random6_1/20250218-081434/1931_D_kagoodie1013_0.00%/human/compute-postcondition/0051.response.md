The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `num` is the second element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still have at least `n` elements, and `num` should now be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is incremented by the sum of the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` (either 0, 1, or 2), `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 2, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`.**
