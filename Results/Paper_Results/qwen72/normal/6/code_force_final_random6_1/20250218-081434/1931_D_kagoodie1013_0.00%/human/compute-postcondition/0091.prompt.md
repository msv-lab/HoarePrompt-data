Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % x` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % y` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `count` is the sum of all the values added during the loop iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys representing the unique remainders of `-num % x` for all elements in `arr` and values representing the count of each remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for all elements in `arr` and values representing the count of each remainder, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count` is the total sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each `num % x` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each `num % y` for all elements in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
