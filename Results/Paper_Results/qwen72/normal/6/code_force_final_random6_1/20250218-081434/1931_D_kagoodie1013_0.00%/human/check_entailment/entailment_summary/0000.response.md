Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to count the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case, where a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). 

However, the implementation in `func_1` has a logical flaw. The function uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to count the number of elements that have the same remainder when negated and taken modulo \(x\), and when taken modulo \(y\), respectively. This approach is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the conditions required for a pair to be beautiful.

To correctly determine if a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies that \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies that \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

The current implementation incorrectly counts pairs based on the remainders of individual elements, rather than pairs of elements. Specifically, it increments the count based on the presence of elements with the same remainders, which does not ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously.

A correct approach would involve iterating through all pairs of elements and checking both conditions explicitly. However, this would be inefficient for large arrays. A more efficient approach would use a single dictionary to count pairs that satisfy both conditions.

Given the logical flaw in the implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
