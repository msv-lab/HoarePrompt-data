Output State: **`count` is the total sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each `num % x` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each `num % y` for all elements in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `count` will hold the total sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each element in `arr` as the loop iterates through all elements.
- The dictionary `mod_x_map` will contain the frequency of each remainder when the elements of `arr` are divided by `x`.
- The dictionary `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each remainder when the elements of `arr` are divided by `y`.
- The list `results` will contain the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it.
- The variables `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` will hold the values calculated for the last element of `arr` after the loop has completed all iterations.
