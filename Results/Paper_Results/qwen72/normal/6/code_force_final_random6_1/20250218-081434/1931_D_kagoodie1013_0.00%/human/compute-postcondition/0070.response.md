Output State: **`count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y_key` to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, where `num` is the first element of `arr` and `y` is the third element of the third tuple in `test_cases`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
