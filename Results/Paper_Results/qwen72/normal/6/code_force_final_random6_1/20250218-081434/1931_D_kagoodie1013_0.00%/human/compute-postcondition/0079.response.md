Output State: **`count` is now equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`.**
