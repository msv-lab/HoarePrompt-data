### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next three elements and the array `arr` from the following `n` elements.
   - This part of the program correctly parses the input and stores it in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

3. **Loop Through Array:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` (which is equivalent to `x - num % x`).
     - `mod_y = num % y`.
   - It then adds the counts of pairs that satisfy the conditions to `count`:
     - `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` gives the count of elements that, when added to `num`, result in a sum divisible by `x`.
     - `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` gives the count of elements that, when subtracted from `num`, result in a difference divisible by `y`.
   - It updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key = num % x` and `mod_y_key = num % y`.
     - It increments the counts in the dictionaries for these remainders.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the `count` of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `mod_x`:**
  - The calculation `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `mod_x = (x - num % x) % x` to ensure the remainder is non-negative.
  - This is because `-num % x` can result in a negative remainder, which is not what we want for counting pairs.

- **Incorrect Counting of Pairs:**
  - The program incorrectly adds the counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` directly. This approach does not correctly account for the pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.
  - Instead, it should check if both conditions are satisfied for each pair of elements and count them accordingly.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to correctly calculate the remainders and count the pairs where both conditions are satisfied.

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly calculates the remainders and counts the pairs where both conditions are satisfied.
- **False**: The original program has logical errors in the calculation of `mod_x` and the counting of pairs.

Given the issues in the original program, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
