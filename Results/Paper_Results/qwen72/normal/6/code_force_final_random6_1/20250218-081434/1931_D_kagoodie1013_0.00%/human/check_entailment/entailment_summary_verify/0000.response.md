### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Separate Modulo Maps**:
   - The program uses two separate dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that both conditions (`a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`) are satisfied simultaneously for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\).

2. **Incorrect Pair Counting**:
   - The program increments the count by the number of elements that have the same remainder when negated and taken modulo `x` (`mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)`) and the number of elements that have the same remainder when taken modulo `y` (`mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`).
   - This means it counts pairs that satisfy either condition but not necessarily both conditions together.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]
     ```
   - The beautiful pairs should be:
     - \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3\) (divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_2 = 1 - 2 = -1\) (not divisible by 2).
     - \(\langle 2, 4 \rangle\): \(a_2 + a_4 = 2 + 5 = 7\) (not divisible by 3) and \(a_2 - a_4 = 2 - 5 = -3\) (divisible by 2).
   - The program will incorrectly count these pairs because it does not check both conditions together.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly count the number of beautiful pairs, the program should:
1. Iterate through all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
2. For each pair, check if both conditions are satisfied:
   - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`.
   - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
3. If both conditions are satisfied, increment the count.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem description.

Final: **False**
