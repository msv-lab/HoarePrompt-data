To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `num` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. Given the initial state, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `num` is the last element of `arr`. 

For the loop to start executing, `arr` must have at least one element. Since the initial state already specifies that `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `n` is at least 1 (as `test_cases` must have at least 2 tuples, and `arr` is part of the second tuple), the loop will execute. However, the initial state of `num` being the last element of `arr` is only relevant after the loop has started, not before it. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect the initial condition of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is now an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`**.
