Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \le t \le 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is very straightforward. It prints the integer `1`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` is mentioned, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
