Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case. This is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Base Case Check**: The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall, spending `k` coins. This matches the problem's requirement and is accurate.

3. **Second Case Check**: The program checks if `n + 2 > k * 2`. This condition can be simplified to `n + 2 > 2k`, which is equivalent to `n > 2k - 2`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is correct because:
   - Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall with price `n - k + 1`. She will buy `k - 1` jewels from this stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - (n - k + 1 - k + 1) = n - (n - 2k + 2) = 2k - 2`.
   - Since `n > 2k - 2`, Alice will have at least 1 coin left, which she will use to buy 1 more jewel from the second stall with price 1.
   - Therefore, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

4. **Third Case Check**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO". This is correct because:
   - If `n <= 2k - 2`, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys them greedily from two stalls with the optimal prices.
   - The program does not need to consider more than two stalls because the problem constraints allow for at most 60 stalls, and the conditions for two stalls are sufficient to determine if it is possible.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the required output format for each test case, including the "YES" or "NO" response, the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls. This is accurate and matches the problem's requirements.

However, there is a potential issue with the second case check. The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is used to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from two stalls. Let's re-evaluate this condition:

- **Condition Analysis**: The condition `n + 2 > 2k` simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`. This means Alice has more than `2k - 2` coins. For Alice to buy `k` jewels from two stalls, she needs to be able to buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
  - The first stall price is `n - k + 1`. Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from this stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
  - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - (n - k + 1 - k + 1) = n - (n - 2k + 2) = 2k - 2`.
  - For Alice to have at least 1 coin left to buy from the second stall, `n` must be greater than `2k - 2`.

The original assessment is correct in its reasoning, but let's verify the edge cases to ensure there are no overlooked issues.

### Edge Case Verification:
- **Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - `n == k` is false.
  - `n + 2 > 2k` is `7 + 2 > 6`, which is true.
  - The program prints "YES", 2, and `7 - 3 + 1 = 5` and `1`.
  - Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall (spending 5 coins) and 1 jewel from the second stall (spending 1 coin), totaling 3 jewels. This is correct.

- **Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - `n == k` is false.
  - `n + 2 > 2k` is `6 + 2 > 8`, which is false.
  - The program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with 6 coins using the given constraints.

- **Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - `n == k` is false.
  - `n + 2 > 2k` is `255 + 2 > 16`, which is true.
  - The program prints "YES", 2, and `255 - 8 + 1 = 248` and `1`.
  - Alice buys 7 jewels from the first stall (spending 248 coins) and 1 jewel from the second stall (spending 1 coin), totaling 8 jewels. This is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all the cases and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
