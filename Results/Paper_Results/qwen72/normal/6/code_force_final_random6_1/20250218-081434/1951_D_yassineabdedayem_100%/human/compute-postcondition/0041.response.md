Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented by `t` times, `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the last input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the placeholder variable `_` has been incremented `t` times, and the variables `n` and `k` hold the values from the last input line read by the loop. The conditions checked in the loop (whether `n` equals `k` or whether `n + 2 > k * 2`) will have been evaluated for each pair of `n` and `k` read from the input, and the appropriate output will have been printed for each iteration. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was only used to determine the number of iterations.
