The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
