Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. It then processes `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` from the standard input, where each `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`. For each pair, the function prints 'YES' and two integers if `n` is equal to `k` or if `n + 2 > k * 2`. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` pairs, the function concludes. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each pair, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in use. **
