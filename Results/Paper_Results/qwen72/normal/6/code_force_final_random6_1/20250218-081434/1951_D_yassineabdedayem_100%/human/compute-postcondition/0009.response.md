Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
2. `_` is a placeholder variable, which is not used in the code snippet.
3. `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
4. `n` is not equal to `k`.
5. The current value of `n` plus 2 is greater than the current value of `k` times 2.

Given these conditions, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes.

### Analysis:
- The condition `n + 2 > 2 * k` is always true based on the initial state.
- Since `n` and `k` are read from the standard input and the condition `n + 2 > 2 * k` is satisfied, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES' because the condition `n + 2 > 2 * k` is always true.

Output: **YES**
