Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
