You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented by `t` times, `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the last input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. It then processes `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` from the standard input, where each `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`. For each pair, the function prints 'YES' and two integers if `n` is equal to `k` or if `n + 2 > k * 2`. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` pairs, the function concludes. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each pair, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in use.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Base Case Check**: The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall, spending `k` coins.

3. **Second Case Check**: The program checks if `n + 2 > k * 2`. This condition can be simplified to `n + 2 > 2k`, which is equivalent to `n > 2k - 2`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is correct because:
   - Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall with price `n - k + 1`. She will buy `k - 1` jewels from this stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - (n - k + 1 - k + 1) = n - (n - 2k + 2) = 2k - 2`.
   - Since `n > 2k - 2`, Alice will have at least 1 coin left, which she will use to buy 1 more jewel from the second stall with price 1.
   - Therefore, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

4. **Third Case Check**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO". This is correct because:
   - If `n <= 2k - 2`, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys them greedily from two stalls with the optimal prices.
   - The program does not need to consider more than two stalls because the problem constraints allow for at most 60 stalls, and the conditions for two stalls are sufficient to determine if it is possible.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the required output format for each test case, including the "YES" or "NO" response, the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the cases correctly and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.
