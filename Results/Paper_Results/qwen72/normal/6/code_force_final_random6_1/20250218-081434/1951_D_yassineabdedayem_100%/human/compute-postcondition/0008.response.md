Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, the current value of `n` plus 2 is greater than the current value of `k` times 2.**
