The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several variables and conditions:
  - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
  - `_` is a placeholder variable that is incremented by 1.
  - `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
  - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

- However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the integer `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
