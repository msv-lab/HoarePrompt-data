Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins, and if so, to provide a possible configuration of stalls and prices.

1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy one jewel from a single stall priced at 1 coin each. This ensures she buys exactly `k` jewels and the solution is straightforward.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and then "1" followed by "1" for this case.

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - This condition simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, it means Alice has enough coins to buy at least one jewel from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and then buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from a stall priced at 1 coin each.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and then "2" followed by `n - k + 1` and `1` for this case.

3. **Case 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels under the constraints of the problem.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" for this case.

The logic of the program is sound and covers all the necessary cases. The conditions and the outputs are consistent with the problem description and the constraints provided.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
