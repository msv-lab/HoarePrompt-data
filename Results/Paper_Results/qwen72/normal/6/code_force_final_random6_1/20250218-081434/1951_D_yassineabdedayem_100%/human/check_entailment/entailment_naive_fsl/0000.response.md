Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when `n` is significantly larger than `k` and there are multiple ways to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program only checks two specific conditions:

1. If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1.
2. If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to cover all possible cases. For example, consider the case where `n = 1000` and `k = 10`. According to the problem description, Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, and each stall can have a price between 1 and \(10^{18}\). In this case, the program will print "NO" because it does not satisfy the condition `n + 2 > k * 2`. However, it is possible to set up 10 stalls with each stall having a price of 100 coins, and Alice will buy exactly 10 jewels, which is a valid solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
