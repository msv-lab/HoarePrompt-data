Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple and must have at least 3 tuples, `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`, `pos` is the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is True if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`.**

The code snippet `total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health` updates the value of `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
