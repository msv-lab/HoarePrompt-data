Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the monsters that were processed before the loop broke or the loop finished, `can_survive` is True if the loop completed without breaking, or False if the loop broke due to `total_bullets_needed` exceeding `distance * k` at any iteration.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is preserved for all variables except `n` and `k`.
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.
- The values of `n` and `k` are now the input integers provided by the user.
