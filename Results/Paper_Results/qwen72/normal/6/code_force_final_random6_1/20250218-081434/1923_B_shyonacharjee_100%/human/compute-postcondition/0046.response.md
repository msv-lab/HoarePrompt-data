Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple and must have at least 1 tuple, `bullets_used` is `health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `0 + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` > `distance * k`, `can_survive` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.**
