Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple and must have at least 1 tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `total_bullets_needed` is assigned the value of `bullets_used + health`.
- Since `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is simply equal to `health`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, `can_survive`, `pos`, `health`, `distance`) retain their initial values.
