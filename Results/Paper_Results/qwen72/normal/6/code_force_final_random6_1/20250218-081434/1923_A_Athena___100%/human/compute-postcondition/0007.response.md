The variables in the loop head are `a` and `a[0]`. The loop condition checks if `a` is not empty and if the first element of `a` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be non-empty, and its first element must still be 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, and `a[0]` was 0. To ensure the loop can execute again, the new first element of `a` must also be 0, and `a` must still be non-empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with its first element being 0, `res` is 0**
