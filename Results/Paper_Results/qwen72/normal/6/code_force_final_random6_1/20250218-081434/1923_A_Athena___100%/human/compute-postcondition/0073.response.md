Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is now the second-to-last element of the initial `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (or `i` is -1 if `a` becomes empty), `res` is 0, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The last element of the list `a` has been removed, so the list `a` now ends with what was the second-to-last element in the initial list. The variable `i` is updated to the new length of `a` minus 1, or -1 if `a` is now empty. The variables `res` and `t` remain unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer.
