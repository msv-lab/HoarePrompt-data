The first element of the list `a` is removed using the `pop(0)` method. The list `a` initially has its first element as 0, so after the operation, the first element of `a` is no longer 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `res` is 0**
