The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, it operates based on a set of predefined test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function evaluates these test cases and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the outcome of each test case. The function always returns `None`.
