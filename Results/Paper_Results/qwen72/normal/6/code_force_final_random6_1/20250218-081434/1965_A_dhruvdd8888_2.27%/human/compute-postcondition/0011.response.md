The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop can execute if the length of `nums` is greater than 2. Since the state already specifies that `nums` has a length greater than 3 (which is more than 2), the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate up to `len(nums) - 3` (inclusive).

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The initial state is sufficient.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `cd` is 0, `i` is 0**
