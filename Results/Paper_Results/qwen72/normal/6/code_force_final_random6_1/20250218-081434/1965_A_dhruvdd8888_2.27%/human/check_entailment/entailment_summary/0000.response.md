### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `N` and the list of integers `nums` representing the number of stones in each pile.

2. **Unique Piles**:
   - The program converts the list of integers `nums` to a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that only unique pile sizes are considered.
   - It then sorts the unique pile sizes.

3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If there is only one unique pile size, Alice wins. This is because Alice can choose `k` equal to the size of the pile and empty all piles in one move.
   - If there are exactly two unique pile sizes, Bob wins. This is because Alice will be forced to choose a `k` that leaves at least one pile non-empty, and Bob can then choose a `k` that empties all remaining piles.
   - If there are more than two unique pile sizes, the program checks for consecutive integers starting from the smallest pile size (after inserting a 0 at the beginning of the list). The number of such consecutive pairs is counted.
   - If the number of consecutive pairs is odd, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is based on the idea that if the number of consecutive pairs is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by choosing the appropriate `k`.

4. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`.
   - The function reads the input, processes it, and prints the winner based on the conditions described.

### Correctness:
The program's logic and the execution summary align with the problem description and the expected outcomes. However, there is a minor issue in the program that could affect its correctness:

- **Issue with `rrr` and `for _ in range(int(input())):`**:
  - The variable `rrr` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary.
  - The `for _ in range(int(input())):` loop should call `func_1()` inside it, but it currently does not. This means that the function `func_1()` is never actually called for each test case, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return print('Alice')
    if len(nums) == 2:
        return print('Bob')
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
    if cd & 1:
        return print('Bob')
    else:
        return print('Alice')
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not call `func_1()` inside the loop for each test case. This is a critical error that prevents the program from processing the test cases and determining the winners correctly.
