Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `cd` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
