Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3. `i` is the largest integer such that the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1 for all 0 <= i < len(nums) - 2, or `i` is the index where the difference is not 1. `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` starting from the first element (0) where the difference is 1, or `cd` remains the value it had when the loop broke.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `N` remain unchanged. The variable `i` will be the largest index where the difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is 1, or it will be the index where the difference is not 1. The variable `cd` will count the number of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` starting from the first element (0) where the difference is 1, or it will retain the value it had when the loop broke out.
