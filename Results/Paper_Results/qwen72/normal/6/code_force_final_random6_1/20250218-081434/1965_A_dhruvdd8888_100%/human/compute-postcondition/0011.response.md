The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `nums` must still have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue, but since `i` is now 2, `nums` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 2, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`**
