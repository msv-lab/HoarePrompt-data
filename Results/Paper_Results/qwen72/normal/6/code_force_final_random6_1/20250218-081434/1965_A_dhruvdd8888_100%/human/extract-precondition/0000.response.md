It seems there was an error in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases and the details of each test case as input. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of test_cases is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
