The code `nums = set(input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and then converts that list into a set, storing the result in the variable `nums`. The initial state includes `test_cases` and `N`, but these are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a set of strings from the input.**
