Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- The integer `N` remains unchanged.
- The list `nums` is modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list (i.e., `ls`).
- The variable `ls` is now equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list.
- The variable `i` is now equal to the index of the last element in the `nums` list, which is `len(nums) - 1`.
