Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is now equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls` plus `nums[2] - ls` plus `nums[2]`, `i` is 2, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - ls`.**
