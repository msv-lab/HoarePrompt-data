Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 2 elements, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, except that `ls` is now updated to be the sum of the first element of `nums` and the value of `nums[1] - ls`. The value of `i` remains 1, and `nums[1]` is still `nums[1] - ls`.
