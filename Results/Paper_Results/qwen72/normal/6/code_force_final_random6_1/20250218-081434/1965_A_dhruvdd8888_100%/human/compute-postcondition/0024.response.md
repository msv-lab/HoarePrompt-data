The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1 to `len(nums) - 2`.

Given that `i` is currently `len(nums) - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 2`. The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range specified, which means `i` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw`, and if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` is True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
