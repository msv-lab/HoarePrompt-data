Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw`, and `cw` is True.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `cw` is True if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, and False if `nums[i]` is 1.
- The code snippet `cw = True` directly sets `cw` to True, regardless of the initial value of `nums[i]`.
- Since `cw` is now True, `nw` will also be True, as `nw` is the same as the value of `cw`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged.
