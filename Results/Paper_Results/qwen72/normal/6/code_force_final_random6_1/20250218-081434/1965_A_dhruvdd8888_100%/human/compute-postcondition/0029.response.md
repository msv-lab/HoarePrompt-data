The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `len(nums) - 2`
- `nums` must have at least 3 elements

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` will be `len(nums) - 3`
- `nums` must still have at least 3 elements for `i` to be within the valid range (0 to `len(nums) - 2`).

Given that `i` is `len(nums) - 2` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(nums) - 3` and `nums` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution, and `cw` is the same as the value of `nw` before the code execution.**
