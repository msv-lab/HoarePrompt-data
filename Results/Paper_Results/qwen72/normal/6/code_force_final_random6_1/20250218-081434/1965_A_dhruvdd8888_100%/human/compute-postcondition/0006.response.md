The code snippet `nums[i] -= ls` modifies the first element of the `nums` list by subtracting the value of `ls` from it. Since `ls` is 0, the value of `nums[i]` remains unchanged. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain the same.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `nums` remains unchanged.**
