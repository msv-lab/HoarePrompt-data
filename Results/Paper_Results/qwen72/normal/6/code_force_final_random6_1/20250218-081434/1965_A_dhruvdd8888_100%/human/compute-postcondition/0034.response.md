Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is 1, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` after the last iteration, and `cw` is the same as the value of `nw` after the last iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `N` input integer remains unchanged.
- The `nums` list remains a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, with each element reduced by the sum of all previous elements.
- The `ls` variable remains the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list.
- The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to 1 (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be 1.
- The `nw` and `cw` variables will both be the same after the last iteration, and their final value depends on the elements in `nums` from `len(nums) - 2` down to 1. If any of these elements are 1, `cw` and `nw` will toggle their values based on the condition in the loop. If none of these elements are 1, `cw` and `nw` will remain `True`.
