Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for Alice and Bob. One clear issue is the handling of the input and the logic for determining the winner.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can win by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, which will leave the piles as \( [0, 1, 2] \). Bob will then be forced to choose \( k = 1 \), leaving the piles as \( [0, 0, 1] \). Alice can then choose \( k = 1 \) again, emptying the last pile and winning the game.

However, the program will output "Bob" for this input. This is because the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The program incorrectly modifies the `nums` list and uses a boolean toggle (`cw` and `nw`) to determine the winner, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach to solve this problem involves determining if the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd or even. If the number of such piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because the game can be reduced to a Nim game where the piles with an odd number of stones are the only ones that matter.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 != 0)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version correctly determines the winner based on the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
