### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call**:
   - The outer loop reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `N` is read as the number of piles.
   - `nums` is read as a set of strings from the input, which is then converted to a set of integers and sorted.
   - The addition of '0' to the set and subsequent conversion to integers and sorting ensures that the list `nums` is always sorted and includes a zero.
   - The loop `for i in range(len(nums))` modifies each element in `nums` by subtracting the cumulative sum `ls` of all previous elements.
   - This transformation is intended to simplify the problem by reducing the pile sizes to their differences from the cumulative sum.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)` iterates over the modified `nums` list in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last element and stopping at the second element.
   - The condition `if nums[i] == 1` is used to toggle the winning state `cw` based on the current pile size.
   - The final winning state is determined by the value of `cw` after the loop, and the winner is printed accordingly.

4. **Logical Analysis**:
   - The transformation of `nums` by subtracting the cumulative sum ensures that each pile size is reduced to the smallest non-zero difference.
   - The winning condition is based on the presence of 1s in the modified list. If there is an odd number of 1s, Alice wins; if there is an even number of 1s, Bob wins.
   - This logic is derived from the fact that if there is an odd number of 1s, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of 1s for Bob, and vice versa.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where there is only one pile with a large number of stones (e.g., `1000000000`), as the transformation will result in a single non-zero element, and Alice will win.
   - The program also handles the case where all piles have the same number of stones (e.g., `3 3 3 3 3`), as the transformation will result in a single non-zero element, and Alice will win.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The addition of '0' to the set `nums` and the subsequent sorting and transformation might introduce unnecessary complexity.
   - The transformation loop `for i in range(len(nums))` and the winning condition loop `for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)` are both necessary and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
