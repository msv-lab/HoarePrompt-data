Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the outcome of some operation on the piles of stones.**
