The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, and `ls` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, `nums` must have at least 1 element, and `i` must start at 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is 0, `i` is 0**
