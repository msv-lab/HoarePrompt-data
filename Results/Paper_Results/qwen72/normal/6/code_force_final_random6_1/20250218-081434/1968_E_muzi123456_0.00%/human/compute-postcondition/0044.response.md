The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will internally handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, it will handle an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function will return a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function handles `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3 and returns a result for each test case.**
