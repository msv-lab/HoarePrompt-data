Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints a sequence of points where each point has the x-coordinate fixed at 1 and the y-coordinate ranging from 1 to \(n\). This means the points are all in the first column of the grid.

Let's analyze the program's output for different values of \(n\):

1. **For \(n = 2\):**
   - The program outputs: 
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1\}\), which has a size of 1. However, the correct set should include 0 and 1, so the size should be 2. The program's output is incorrect for this case.

2. **For \(n = 3\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the correct set should include 0, 1, 2, and 3, so the size should be 4. The program's output is incorrect for this case.

3. **For \(n = 4\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-4| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |3-4| = 1\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 3. However, the correct set should include 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so the size should be 7. The program's output is incorrect for this case.

4. **For \(n = 5\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 5
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-4| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-5| = 4\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-5| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |3-4| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |3-5| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |4-5| = 1\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the correct set should include 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, so the size should be 10. The program's output is incorrect for this case.

5. **For \(n = 6\):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 5
     1 6
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-4| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-5| = 4\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-6| = 5\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-5| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-6| = 4\)
     - \(|1-1| + |3-4| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |3-5| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |3-6| = 3\)
     - \(|1-1| + |4-5| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |4-6| = 2\)
     - \(|1-1| + |5-6| = 1\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 5. However, the correct set should include 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, so the size should be 12. The program's output is incorrect for this case.

The program consistently outputs points that do not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The points are all in the first column, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances. To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be distributed more evenly across the grid.

Correctness: **False**
