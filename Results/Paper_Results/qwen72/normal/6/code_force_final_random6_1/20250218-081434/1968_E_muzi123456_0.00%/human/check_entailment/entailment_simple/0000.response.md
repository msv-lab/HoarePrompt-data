Reasoning:

The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, reads an integer \(n\). For each \(n\), it prints a sequence of points \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\).

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the value of \(n\) for each test case.
   - The loop `while t:` ensures that the program processes each test case.

2. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the points \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This means all points are on the first row of the grid.
   - The distances between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) (where \(i \neq j\)) are \(|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|\). Since \(i\) and \(j\) range from 1 to \(n\), the possible distances are \(1, 2, \ldots, n-1\).

3. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all distances from 1 to \(n-1\) because the points are chosen such that the Manhattan distance between any two points is exactly the difference in their column indices.
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n-1\), which is the maximum possible size for a set of distances between \(n\) points on a single row.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The program prints an extra space after the last point for each test case, which is not necessary but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The problem does not specify that the points must be on the first row, but the program's output is valid because it maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) by choosing points on the first row of the grid. The output is valid and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
