The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` must start from 1 and iterate up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `i` needs to be reset to 1 (the starting value of the range), and `n` must be at least 1, which it already is since `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 1**
