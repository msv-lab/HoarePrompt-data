Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`, printing '1' followed by the current value of `i` on each iteration. Once the loop finishes, `i` will have reached the value of `n`.
