The `print` statement in the provided code snippet will print the string `'1'` and will not move to a new line after printing, as specified by the `end=' '` parameter.

Here's the breakdown:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` and using `end=' '` to specify that a space should be used instead of a newline at the end of the output.

Output: **1 (followed by a space)**
