The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is increased by `f`**
