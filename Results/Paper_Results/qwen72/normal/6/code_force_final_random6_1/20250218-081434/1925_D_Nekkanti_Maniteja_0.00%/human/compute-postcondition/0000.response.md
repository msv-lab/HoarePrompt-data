The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0. The other details about the function `func` and the constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
