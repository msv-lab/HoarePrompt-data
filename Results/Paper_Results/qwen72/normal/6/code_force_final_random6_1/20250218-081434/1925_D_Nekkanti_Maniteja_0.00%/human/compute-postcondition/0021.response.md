Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `m` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are input integers, `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `k` must be greater than `m + 1`, `s` is increased by `c * (m + 1) * c * m + c * a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `m + 1`.
- The value of `m` remains an input integer.
- The values of `u` and `v` remain as input integers.
- The value of `a` is still increased by the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.
- The value of `k` must still be greater than `m + 1`.
- The value of `s` is increased by the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`, which simplifies to `c * (m + 1) * c * m + c * a`. Therefore, `s` is increased by `c * (m + 1) * c * m + c * a`.
