The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m-1`, and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is `m-1` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `m` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than `m`.

State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are input integers, `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `k` must be greater than `m`, `s` is increased by `c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a`**
