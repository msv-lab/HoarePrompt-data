### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The initial friendship values are given for `m` pairs of friends.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends is \( a \).
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times (i + 1) \), where \( i \) is the current excursion number (0-indexed).

3. **Sum of Friendship Values Over `k` Excursions:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i \right)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{m \times k \times (k+1)}{n(n-1)}
     \]

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) is used to compute the division in modular arithmetic.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - It sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - It then iterates over `k` excursions, adding the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.
   - The program uses the formula \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \), which is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a \).

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program iterates over `k` excursions and updates `s` using the formula \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).
   - This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. The term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * m * (i + 1)`.

7. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula for each excursion should be:
     \[
     s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a
     \]
   - This ensures that the expected increase in friendship values is correctly calculated for each excursion.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. The correct formula should be \( s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a \) instead of \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).

Final: **False**
