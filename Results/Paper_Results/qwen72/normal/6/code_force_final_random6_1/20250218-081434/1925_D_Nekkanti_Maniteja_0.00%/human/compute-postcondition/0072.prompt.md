Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. Additionally, m lines follow, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k-1`, `m` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are input integers, `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `k` must be greater than `m-1`, `s` is increased by the sum of `c * (m-1 + j) * c * m + c * a` for `j` from `0` to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `m`, `m` is the second input integer, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k - 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `s + c * (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) * c * m + c * a * k`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
