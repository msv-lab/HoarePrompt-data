Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, and `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`. The difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // 1`, which simplifies to `a[0] + k` since `i + 1` is 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The condition `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)` still holds true.
