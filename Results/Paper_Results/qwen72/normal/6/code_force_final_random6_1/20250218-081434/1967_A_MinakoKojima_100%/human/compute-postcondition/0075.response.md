To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is the loop iterator and will start from 0 by default.

Let's go through the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **`n` must be greater than 1**: This is required for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **`i` is 0**: This is the default starting value for the loop iterator.

The other variables and objects (`t`, `_`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.**
