Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the first element of `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

The value of `dif` is calculated as the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
