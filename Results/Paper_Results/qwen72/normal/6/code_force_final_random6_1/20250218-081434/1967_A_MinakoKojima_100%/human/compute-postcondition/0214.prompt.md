You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers, each a_i where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case, `a` is the last element in `ans_list`, `ans_list` must have exactly `t` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` of the number of cards of each type. It returns a list where each element is the maximum number of distinct types of cards that can be obtained using the available coins for the corresponding test case.
