The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `ans_list`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans_list`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the list `ans_list` must have at least one more element beyond the current element being processed.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is `t - 1`
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `a` is the second element in `ans_list`
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`
- `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations
- `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration
- `ans_list` contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case
- `ans_list` must have at least 2 elements

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `ans_list` must be processed. Since `a` is the second element in `ans_list`, the next element will be the third element in `ans_list`. Therefore, `a` will be the third element in `ans_list` and `ans_list` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is the third element in `ans_list`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case, `ans_list` must have at least 3 elements**
