Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`.** 

The value of `dif` is now calculated as the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
