The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input
- `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`
- `res` is equal to `n - 1`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is 0**
