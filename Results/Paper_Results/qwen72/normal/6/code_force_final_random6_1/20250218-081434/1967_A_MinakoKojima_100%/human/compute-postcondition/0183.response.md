Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is `res - 1`.**

The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The values of `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `dif` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
