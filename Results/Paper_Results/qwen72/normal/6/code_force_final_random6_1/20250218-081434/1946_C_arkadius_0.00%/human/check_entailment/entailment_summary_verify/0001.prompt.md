You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` reads input values for `n` and `k` (integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5) and a series of `n-1` edges represented by pairs of integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, roots the tree at node 0, and prints the number of nodes at depth `k` in the tree. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a tree with \( n \) vertices.
   - We need to remove exactly \( k \) edges from this tree.
   - The goal is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of several functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - `func_2` and `func_1` are helper functions to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **`func_5`**:
     - Reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges to remove \( k \).
     - Constructs the tree using the `Tree` class.
     - Adds edges to the tree.
     - Roots the tree non-recursively.
     - Calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \) and prints the result.
     - This function seems to handle the input and output correctly.

   - **`func_4`**:
     - Performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
     - Uses `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is valid.
     - Adjusts the search range based on the result of `func_3`.
     - Returns the maximum \( x \).
     - The binary search is a standard approach for finding the maximum \( x \) that satisfies a condition.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - Uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - Checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or equal to \( k \) with the remaining size being at least \( x \).
     - Returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.
     - This function correctly implements the logic to check the validity of \( x \).

   - **`func_2`**:
     - Recursively computes the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - This function is not used in the final solution, but it seems to be a redundant implementation of the same logic as `func_1`.

   - **`func_1`**:
     - Uses a stack to perform a non-recursive post-order traversal of the tree.
     - Computes the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - This function correctly implements the logic to compute the required values.

4. **Tree Class**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to have methods for adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The `Tree` class should have a structure that allows for the traversal and computation of good components and remaining sizes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum \( x \) is found efficiently.
   - The post-order traversal in `func_1` ensures that the tree is processed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum \( x \) such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices after removing \( k \) edges.

### Correctness:
**True**
