Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element and `(u, False)` as the last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
