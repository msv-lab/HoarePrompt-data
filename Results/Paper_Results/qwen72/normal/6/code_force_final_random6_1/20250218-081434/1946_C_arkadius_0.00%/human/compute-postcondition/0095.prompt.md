Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. If `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains an empty list, `v` is a valid vertex in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully iterated over. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its initial value plus the sum of `good_components` of all its children, plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to its initial value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed. If `postorder` is True, for each child `u` of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all such children `u`. For each child `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. If `postorder` is False, `stack` has the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` appended to it.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed but still contains at least one tuple. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is equal to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` that have been processed. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v` that has a `remaining_size` less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is equal to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for these children. If any child `u` has a `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1 for each such child. If `postorder` is False, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element and all the children of `v` as the last elements in the stack, each with the boolean value `False`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
