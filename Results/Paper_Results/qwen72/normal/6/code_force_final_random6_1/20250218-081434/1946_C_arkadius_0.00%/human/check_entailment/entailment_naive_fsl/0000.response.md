Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case. Here is one specific issue:

1. **Edge Case Handling in `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is equal to `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`. However, it does not handle the case where the number of good components is less than `k` but the remaining size is large enough to form a valid component. This can lead to incorrect results.

   For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   5 2
   1 2
   1 3
   3 4
   3 5
   ```
   The tree looks like this:
   ```
       1
      / \
     2   3
        / \
       4   5
   ```
   If we remove the edges `(1, 3)` and `(3, 4)`, the tree will split into three components: `{1, 2}`, `{3}`, and `{4, 5}`. The sizes of these components are 2, 1, and 2, respectively. The maximum `x` such that each component has at least `x` vertices is 1. However, the program might incorrectly return 2 because it does not handle the case where the number of good components is less than `k` but the remaining size is large enough to form a valid component.

This issue can be addressed by ensuring that the program correctly handles all edge cases and scenarios where the number of good components is less than `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
