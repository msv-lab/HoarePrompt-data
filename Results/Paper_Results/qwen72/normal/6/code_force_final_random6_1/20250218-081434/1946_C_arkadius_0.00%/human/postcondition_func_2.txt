The function `func_3` takes a Tree object `tree` with `n` vertices, a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` (where 1 <= k < n), and a positive integer `x`. It returns `True` if the number of good components in the tree, as determined by `func_1(tree, 0, x)`, is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size of the tree is at least `x`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
