Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed but still contains at least one tuple. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is equal to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` that have been processed. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v` that has a `remaining_size` less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is equal to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for these children. If any child `u` has a `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1 for each such child. If `postorder` is False, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element and all the children of `v` as the last elements in the stack, each with the boolean value `False`.***
