Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remain unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
