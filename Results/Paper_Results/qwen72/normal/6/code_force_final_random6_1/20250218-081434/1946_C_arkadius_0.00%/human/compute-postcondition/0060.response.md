Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remains unchanged, `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged.**
