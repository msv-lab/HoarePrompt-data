Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `func` should take two parameters `a` and `b` to represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function does not include these parameters, which is incorrect.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())` and then iterates `t` times to read each test case.
   - Inside the loop, the function reads a line of input and splits it into two integers `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the condition `if ((a + b) % 2 == 0)`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".
   - This logic is incorrect. The game's outcome is not determined by the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. Instead, it depends on the optimal play strategy, which involves considering the number of moves each player can make.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The game is a turn-based game where each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - The correct logic for determining the winner is based on the fact that the player with more coins can always force the other player into a losing position if the number of coins is not equal. If the number of coins is equal, the player who starts (Alice) will lose because she will be the first to run out of moves.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, Alice can always win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin, forcing Bob into a position where he has fewer coins.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, Bob can always win by following the same strategy.
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, Alice will lose because she will be the first to run out of moves.

Given the above reasoning, the provided logic in the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
