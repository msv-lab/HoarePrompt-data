You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b` which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(a, b):`.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the final input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the final input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the final input string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *`i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the final input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the final input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the final input string `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is divisible by 2. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function definition is incorrect and does not include these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
