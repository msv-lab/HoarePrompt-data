Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd and prints "bob" if the sum is even and "alice" if the sum is odd. However, the game's outcome is not solely determined by the parity of the sum of the coins.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to consider the number of moves each player can make. Each player can make a move if they have at least one coin, and the game ends when a player cannot make a move. The key observation is that the player with the larger number of coins can always force the game to end in a way that benefits them, provided they play optimally.

Here is the correct logic:
- If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win because Alice will be the first to run out of moves.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with the larger number of coins can always force the game to end in a way that benefits them. Specifically, if the difference in the number of coins is odd, Alice will win; if the difference is even, Bob will win.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif (a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
