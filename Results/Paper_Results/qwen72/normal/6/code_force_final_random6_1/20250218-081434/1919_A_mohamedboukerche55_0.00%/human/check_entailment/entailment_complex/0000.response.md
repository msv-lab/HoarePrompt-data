Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it should take two parameters `a` and `b` to represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This is a critical error because the function needs to process these values for each test case.

2. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. However, it only processes the last test case because the variables `a` and `b` are overwritten in each iteration. This means that the function will only check the sum of the last pair of integers, which is incorrect.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic for determining the winner is based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. This is a correct approach because:
   - If the sum is even, the game will end with both players having an equal number of moves, and Bob will win because Alice will be the one who cannot make a move last.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice will have one more move than Bob, and she will win.

4. **Output Format**: The function prints "bob" or "alice" with an extra space at the end, which is not consistent with the expected output format. The correct output should be "Bob" or "Alice" without any trailing spaces.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
