Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of input lines, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`. After reading the specified number of lines, it checks the sum of the last pair of integers (`a` and `b`). If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value. **
