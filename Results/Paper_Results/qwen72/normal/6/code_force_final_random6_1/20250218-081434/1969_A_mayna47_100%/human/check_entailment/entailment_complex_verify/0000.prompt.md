You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n; p_i ≠ i; all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is `n + 1`, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. The program returns nothing.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers from user input. It checks if there are any pairs of friends in the list `p` where each friend is the best friend of the other. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns. If no such pair is found, it prints `3` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, then the answer is 2. However, this is not always correct. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Output:
```
3
```

The program will output 2, which is incorrect. In this case, there is a cycle of length 4 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), and to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends, as shown in the problem description. The program fails to account for cycles of length greater than 2.
