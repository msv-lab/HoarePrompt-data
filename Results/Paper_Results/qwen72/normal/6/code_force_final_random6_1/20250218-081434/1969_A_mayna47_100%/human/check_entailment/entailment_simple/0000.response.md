Reasoning:  
The program provided is not fully correct based on the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Duplicate Initialization of `v`**: The list `v` is initialized twice. First, it is initialized as a list of zeros with length `n + 1`. Then, it is re-initialized as a list with a zero at the beginning followed by the list of best friends. This is redundant and can be simplified.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program calls `func_1()` for each test case, but the function does not handle the test cases correctly. It only prints the result for the first test case and then returns, which means it will not process subsequent test cases.

3. **Logic for Minimum Invitations**: The logic inside `func_1()` is incorrect. It checks if `v[v[i]] == i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If this condition is true, it prints 2 and returns. However, this only checks for pairs of friends who are best friends with each other and can attend the party if both are invited. It does not handle the general case where the friends are not in such pairs but can still be invited in a way that at least 2 friends attend the party.

4. **General Case Handling**: If no such pairs are found, the program prints 3. This is not always correct. For example, in the second test case provided, the correct answer is 3, but in other cases, the minimum number of invitations could be different.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Remove the redundant initialization of `v`.
- Ensure that `func_1()` processes all test cases.
- Implement a correct logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    result = func_1()
    print(result)

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize a set to keep track of visited friends
    visited = set()
    
    # Initialize the minimum number of invitations to n (worst case)
    min_invitations = n
    
    # Iterate through each friend
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i not in visited:
            # Start a new cycle
            cycle = set()
            current = i
            while current not in cycle:
                cycle.add(current)
                visited.add(current)
                current = v[current]
            
            # If the cycle length is 2, we can invite both friends in the cycle
            if len(cycle) == 2:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
            else:
                # Otherwise, we need to invite at least one friend from each cycle
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, len(cycle))
    
    # Ensure at least 2 friends attend the party
    return max(2, min_invitations)
```

This corrected program:
- Initializes `v` correctly.
- Uses a set to track visited friends and identify cycles.
- Calculates the minimum number of invitations needed by considering the length of cycles.
- Ensures that at least 2 friends attend the party.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
