The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers from user input. It checks if there are any pairs of friends in the list `p` where each friend is the best friend of the other. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns. If no such pair is found, it prints `3` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
