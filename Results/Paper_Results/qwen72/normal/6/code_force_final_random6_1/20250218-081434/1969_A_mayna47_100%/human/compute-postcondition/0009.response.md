Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet simply prints the integer 2.
   - The initial state provides information about the list `v` and the variable `i`, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer 2, regardless of the values in the list `v` or the variable `i`.

Output: **2**
