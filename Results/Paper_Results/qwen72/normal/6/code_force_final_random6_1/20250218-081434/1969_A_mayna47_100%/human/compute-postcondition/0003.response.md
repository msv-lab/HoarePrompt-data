The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since `n` is already specified to be between 2 and 50, the loop will definitely execute. The variable `i` will start at 1 and iterate up to `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Since `n` is between 2 and 50, the loop will execute at least once, starting with `i` at 1.

State: **`v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 1**
