Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends attend the party. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1` reads the number of friends `n` and the list `v` (which is actually the list `p` from the problem description, but with an extra `0` at the beginning to make it 1-indexed).

2. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**: The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, indicating a mutual best friend pair.

3. **Output Based on Condition**:
   - If a mutual best friend pair is found, the program prints `2` and returns. This is because inviting both members of the pair will ensure that both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3` and returns. This is because in the absence of mutual best friend pairs, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 3 friends will always result in at least 2 of them coming, as each invited friend's best friend is also invited.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program assumes that if there are no mutual best friend pairs, the minimum number of invitations needed is always 3. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. In this case, there are no mutual best friend pairs, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, which is the minimum required. However, the program would print `3`, which is correct in this case but not always.

To correctly handle all cases, the program should:
- Identify all mutual best friend pairs and count them.
- If there is at least one mutual best friend pair, print `2`.
- If there are no mutual best friend pairs, the program should find the smallest set of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This can be done by identifying the smallest cycle in the best friend relationships or by ensuring that the invitations cover a set of friends where each friend's best friend is also invited.

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce the correct minimum number of invitations for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
