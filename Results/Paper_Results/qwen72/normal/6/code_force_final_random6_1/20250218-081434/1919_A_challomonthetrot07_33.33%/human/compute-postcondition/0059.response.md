The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Since the function signature does not include parameters, it is likely that these parameters are provided in a different way, such as through global variables or user input within the function body.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000).**
