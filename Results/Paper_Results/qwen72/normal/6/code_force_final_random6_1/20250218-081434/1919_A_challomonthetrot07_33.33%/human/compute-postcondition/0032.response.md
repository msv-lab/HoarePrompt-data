Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
  - If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged.
  - If `a` is not equal to `b`:
    - If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1.
    - If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even).
    - If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1.
    - If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even).
  - The relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Bob'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Bob'` regardless of the initial state of the variables.

Output: **Bob**
