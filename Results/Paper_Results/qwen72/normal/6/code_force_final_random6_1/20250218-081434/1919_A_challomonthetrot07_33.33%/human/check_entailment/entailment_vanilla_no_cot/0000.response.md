Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. Here are the issues:

1. **Initial Condition Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a == b` (both players have the same number of coins), and Bob wins because the game will end in a draw, and the player who makes the last move (Bob) wins.
   - However, the conditions for `a == 1` and `b == 1` are not correctly handled. If `a == 1`, Alice will lose immediately because she cannot remove a coin from her wallet. Similarly, if `b == 1`, Bob will lose immediately because he cannot remove a coin from his wallet.

2. **Parity Handling**:
   - The program checks if `a % 2 == 1` (Alice has an odd number of coins) and prints 'Bob'. This is incorrect because if Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob to lose by playing optimally.
   - The program checks if `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` (Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins) and prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can always force Bob to lose by playing optimally.
   - The program checks if `a > b` and prints 'Bob'. This is incorrect because the parity of the coins is more important than the absolute number of coins. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 3`, Alice can force Bob to lose by playing optimally.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the general case where both `a` and `b` are greater than 1 and have different parities. The correct logic should consider the parity of the coins and the number of moves each player can make.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected version handles the initial conditions and the parity of the coins correctly, ensuring that the game is played optimally and the correct winner is determined.
