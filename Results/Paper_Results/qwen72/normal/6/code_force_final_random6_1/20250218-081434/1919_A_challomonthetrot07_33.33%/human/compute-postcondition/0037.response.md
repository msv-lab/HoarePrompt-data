Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the input integers. If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the following conditions apply: If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1. If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even). If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even). Additionally, if `a` is greater than `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` also remains unchanged.***
