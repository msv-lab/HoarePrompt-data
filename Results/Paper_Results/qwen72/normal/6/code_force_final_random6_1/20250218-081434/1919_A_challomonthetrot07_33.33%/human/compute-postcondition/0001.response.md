The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function before the loop starts, so it does not need to be explicitly adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
