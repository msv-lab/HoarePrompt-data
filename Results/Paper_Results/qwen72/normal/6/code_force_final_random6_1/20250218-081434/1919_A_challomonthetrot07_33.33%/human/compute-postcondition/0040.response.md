Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the input integers. If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even). If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the following conditions apply: If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1. If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even). Additionally, if `a` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is odd or `b` is even, the relationship between `a` and `b` also remains unchanged.***
