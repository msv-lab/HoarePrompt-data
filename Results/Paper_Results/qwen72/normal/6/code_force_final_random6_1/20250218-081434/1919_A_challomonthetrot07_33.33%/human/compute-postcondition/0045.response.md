The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Bob')
```

This code simply prints the string 'Bob'. The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, the initial state does not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **Bob**
