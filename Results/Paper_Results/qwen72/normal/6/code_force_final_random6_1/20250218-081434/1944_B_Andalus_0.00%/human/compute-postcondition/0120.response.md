The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(T)` loop. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly modified or referenced in the state provided, it is the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop counter `_` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `T`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`, `sng` is a list that must have at least `min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))` elements, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T` for the loop to execute again.**
