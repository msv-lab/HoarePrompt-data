Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
