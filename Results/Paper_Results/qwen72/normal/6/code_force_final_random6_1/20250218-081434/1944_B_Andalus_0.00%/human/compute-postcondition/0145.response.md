Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `sng` has been appended with the value of `lft[3]`. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index 3 of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, then `sng` has been appended with the value of `lft[3]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `sng` remains unchanged.**
