Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is unchanged, `elem` is undefined, `_` is `T`, `rdb` now contains the fourth element of `rgt`.**

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) from the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Therefore, `rdb` now contains the fourth element of `rgt`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
