To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer

For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to start from 1 and ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
