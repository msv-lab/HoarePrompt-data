The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It then prints up to `k` pairs of integers from the first half of the list and up to `k` pairs of integers from the second half of the list. The pairs are formed by consecutive duplicates in the sorted halves of the list, and any remaining single elements from the sorted halves. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input list `a` and the integer `k` are unchanged, but the internal state variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` used for processing are reset for each test case.
