Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements processed from `sng`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial values.
- The lists `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The lists `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` also remain unchanged.
- The variable `elem` holds the last element from `sng` that was processed before the loop either broke or finished.
- The variable `sz` is updated to the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements processed from `sng`. If the loop broke because `sz` reached `k`, then `sz` will be equal to `k`. Otherwise, `sz` will be `2 * len(ldb) + len(sng)`.
