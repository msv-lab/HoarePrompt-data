Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2. If `k - sz < 2`, `sz` remains 0.***
