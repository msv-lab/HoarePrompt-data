Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 0, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
