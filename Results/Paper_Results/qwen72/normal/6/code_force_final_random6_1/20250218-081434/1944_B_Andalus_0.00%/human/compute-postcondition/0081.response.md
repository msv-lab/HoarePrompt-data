Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is 0, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, followed by as many elements from `sng` as needed to reach a total of `k` elements printed, separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- `sz` is set to 0, overriding its previous value.
- The values of `i`, `rdb`, and the state of the loop (which has printed elements from `ldb` and `sng`) remain unchanged.
