Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.**
