Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1` (where `n` is some integer).
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively (the exact elements of `rdb` are not provided, but they are derived from `rgt`).
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `ldb` must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.
   - The current value of `sz` is 0.
   - `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 (where `k` is some integer).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and we don't have the exact value of `elem` from the initial state, we can only describe it as the first element in `ldb`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element in the list `ldb`)**
