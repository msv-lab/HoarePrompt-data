Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb))`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at `n - 1`.
- The list `rdb` remains the same, containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
- The variable `sz` is updated to the minimum of `k` and twice the length of `rdb`. This is because the loop prints each element in `rdb` twice, and it stops either when `sz` reaches `k` or when all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice. If `rdb` has fewer than `k // 2` elements, `sz` will be `2 * len(rdb)`. If `rdb` has more than or equal to `k // 2` elements, `sz` will be `k`.
