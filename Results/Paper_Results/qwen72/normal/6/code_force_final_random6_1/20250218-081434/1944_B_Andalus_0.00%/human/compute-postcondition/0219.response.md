Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 6 if `k - sz >= 2` and 4 otherwise, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that will be processed, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `sz` is incremented by 2.
- If `k - sz >= 2` was true initially, `sz` was 4, so now `sz` is 6.
- If `k - sz >= 2` was false initially, `sz` was 2, so now `sz` is 4.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
