Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, plus the number of elements printed from `sng` before `sz` reached `k`, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `ldb` still contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element.
- The list `sng` still contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element).
- The variable `k` remains unchanged.
- The list `lst` remains unchanged.
- The list `lft` remains unchanged.
- The list `rgt` remains unchanged.
- The variable `sz` is updated to the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, plus the number of elements printed from `sng` before `sz` reached `k`.
- The variable `_` remains `T`.
- The list `rdb` still contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`.
- The variable `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
