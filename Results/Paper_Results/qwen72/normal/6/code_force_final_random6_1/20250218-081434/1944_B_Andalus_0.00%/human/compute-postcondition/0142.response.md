Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index 2 of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`, then `sng` has been appended with the value of `lft[2]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `sng` remains unchanged.***
