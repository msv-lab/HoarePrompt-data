Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 3`, `sng` is a list that must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 3`.
- The values of `i`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged.
- The condition that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, still holds true.
