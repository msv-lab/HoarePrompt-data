Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is 0, `ldb` must have at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. The current value of `sz` is 0, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
