Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`, `sng` is an empty list, `elem` is undefined, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T` for the loop to execute again, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from index `n` to the end of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the list `ldb` has been appended with the element at index 1 of `lft`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list that includes the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index 2 of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`, then `sng` has been appended with the value of `lft[2]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `sng` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index 3 of `lft` and `sng` remains unchanged. If `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, then `sng` has been appended with the value of `lft[3]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `sng` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
