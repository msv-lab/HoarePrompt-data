Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
   - `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 2`.
   - `sng` is a list that must have at least three elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem`.
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in the list `sng`.
   - Since `sng` is a list that must have at least three elements, `elem` is guaranteed to exist and will be the third element of `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the third element of the list `sng`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **elem (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
