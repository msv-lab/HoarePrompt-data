Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now `n - 1`.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `k` also remains unchanged.
- The list `ldb` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `sng` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `sz` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `_` remains `T + 1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `rdb` now contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, as the loop appends such elements to `rdb`.
- The variable `elem` remains the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `lst` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `lft` remains the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `rgt` remains the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, as it is not modified within the loop.
