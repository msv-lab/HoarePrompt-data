Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `n - 1`, which is the last index of the `rgt` list that the loop checks. The list `rdb` will contain all the elements from the `rgt` list that appear consecutively, meaning that for each index `i` in `rgt` (from 1 to `n-1`), if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rgt[i]` will be appended to `rdb`. All other variables (`a`, `k`, `T`, `lst`, `lft`, `rdb`, and `sng`) will remain unchanged from their initial states, as they are not modified by the loop.
