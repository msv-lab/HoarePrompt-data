Output State: **`sz` is `sz + 2`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since the initial state already indicates that `sz` is `sz + 1`, after the code snippet is executed, `sz` becomes `sz + 2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
