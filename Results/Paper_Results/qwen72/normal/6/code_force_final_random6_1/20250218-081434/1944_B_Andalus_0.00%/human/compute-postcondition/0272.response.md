The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.**
