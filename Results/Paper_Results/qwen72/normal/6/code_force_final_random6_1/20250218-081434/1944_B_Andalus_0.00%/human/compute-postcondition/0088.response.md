Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, so `sz` is now 2.
- The other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `elem`) and conditions (the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, and the program's behavior based on `sz` and `k`) remain unchanged.
