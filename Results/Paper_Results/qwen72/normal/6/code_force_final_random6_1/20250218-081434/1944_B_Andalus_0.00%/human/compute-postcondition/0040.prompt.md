Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that appear consecutively (i.e., `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` for 1 ≤ i < n), `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that do not appear consecutively and are not the last element of `lft` (i.e., `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` for 1 ≤ i < n - 1), `i` is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` is a list that now contains the value of `rgt[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` is a list that now contains the value of `rgt[1]` and the value of `rgt[2]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains a list that contains the value of `rgt[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `rdb` is a list. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[1]`, `rgt[2]`, and `rgt[3]`. Otherwise, `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[1]` and `rgt[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
