The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is unchanged, `elem` is undefined, `_` is `T`. If the second element of `rgt` is equal to the first element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the second element of `rgt`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.**
