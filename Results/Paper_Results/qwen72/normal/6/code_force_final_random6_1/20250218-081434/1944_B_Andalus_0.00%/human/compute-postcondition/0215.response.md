The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the second-to-last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, and `rdb` must contain at least two elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least one more element after the second-to-last element, making it at least three elements in total. The next `elem` will be the last element in `rdb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` and 2 otherwise, `_` is `T`, `rdb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that will be processed, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` is less than `k` and no loop or if statement is broken out of.**
