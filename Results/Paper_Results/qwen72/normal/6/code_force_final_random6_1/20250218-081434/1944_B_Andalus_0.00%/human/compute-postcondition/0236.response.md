Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 3 elements
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `lst` is unchanged
   - `lft` is unchanged
   - `rgt` is unchanged
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 2
   - `_` is `T`
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space.
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in `sng`.
   - `sng` is a list that contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element, and it must have at least 3 elements.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `sng`, and `sng` is a list with at least 3 elements, the print statement will output the third element of `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[third element of sng] (where sng is a list containing elements from lft that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element, and it must have at least 3 elements)**
