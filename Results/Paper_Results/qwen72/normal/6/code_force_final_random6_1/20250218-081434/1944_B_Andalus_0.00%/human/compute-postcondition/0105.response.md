Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb))`, `sng` is a list that must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
