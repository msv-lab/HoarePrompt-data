To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `sng`.

1. **`elem`**: This variable will be assigned the elements of `sng` one by one during the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `elem` does not need a specific value, as it will be assigned by the loop.

2. **`sng`**: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The state of `sng` is crucial because if `sng` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is unchanged
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
- `k` is unchanged
- `lst` is unchanged
- `lft` is unchanged
- `rgt` is unchanged
- `sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller
- `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished
- `_` is `T`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`

To ensure the loop can execute, the list `sng` must have at least one element. The value of `elem` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be assigned by the loop.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 1 element, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`**
