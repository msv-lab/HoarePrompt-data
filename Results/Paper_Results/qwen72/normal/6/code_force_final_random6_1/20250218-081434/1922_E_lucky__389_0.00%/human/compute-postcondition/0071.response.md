Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. It then constructs a list `ansv` of integers such that the list has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The length of `ansv` is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If such a list can be constructed, the function prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` on a single line. If no such list exists, the function prints `0` followed by a blank line. **
