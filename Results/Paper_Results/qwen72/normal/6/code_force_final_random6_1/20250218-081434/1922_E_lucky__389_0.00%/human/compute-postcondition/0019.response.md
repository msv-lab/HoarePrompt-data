Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 1), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\). If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `x` is now `x - 2` and `mx` is the maximum of the original `mx` and `i`.***
