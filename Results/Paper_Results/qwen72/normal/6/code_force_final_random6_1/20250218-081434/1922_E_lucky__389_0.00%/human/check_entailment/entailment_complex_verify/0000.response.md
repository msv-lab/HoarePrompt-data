### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Task**: Given a positive integer \( X \), find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, print -1.
- **Constraints**: \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \)
- **Output**: The length of the array and the array itself, or -1 if no such array exists.

#### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initial Setup**:
     - Reads the integer \( X \).
     - Decrements \( X \) by 1.
     - Initializes `subseq_lens` as an empty list and `mx` as 0.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0.
     - For each iteration, it finds the largest integer \( i \) such that \( 2^{i+1} \le x + 1 \).
     - Appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens`.
     - Subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
     - Updates `mx` to the maximum value of \( i \) found.
   - **Array Construction**:
     - Creates an array `ansv` containing integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \).
     - Appends the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end of `ansv`.
   - **Output**:
     - Prints the length of `ansv`.
     - Prints the elements of `ansv`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - It expects an integer \( X \) as input.

- **State After Main Loop**:
  - `x` is 0.
  - `subseq_lens` contains the largest integers \( i \) such that \( 2^i - 1 \) can be subtracted from the initial \( x - 1 \) without making \( x \) negative.
  - `mx` is the maximum value of \( i \) found during the loop execution.

- **State After Array Construction**:
  - `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \) with the elements `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]` appended to it.
  - The length of `ansv` is at most 200.
  - The elements of `ansv` are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

#### Case Analysis
1. **Input: \( X = 2 \)**
   - **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - **Program Output**:
     ```
     1
     0
     ```
   - **Correctness**: The array `[0]` has 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`. This is correct.

2. **Input: \( X = 5 \)**
   - **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - **Program Output**:
     ```
     3
     0 1 0
     ```
   - **Correctness**: The array `[0, 1, 0]` has the following increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]` (3)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[0, 1]` (1)
     - Total: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
   - This is correct.

3. **Input: \( X = 13 \)**
   - **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - **Program Output**:
     ```
     5
     2 2 3 4 2
     ```
   - **Correctness**: The array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has the following increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[2]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[2]` (5)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[3, 4]` (5)
     - Subsequences of length 3: `[2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4]` (2)
     - Total: 1 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 13
   - This is correct.

4. **Input: \( X = 37 \)**
   - **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 37 increasing subsequences.
   - **Program Output**:
     ```
     7
     -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
     ```
   - **Correctness**: The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has the following increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[-1]`, `[-1]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[-1]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 2]`, `[-1, 3]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 2]`, `[-1, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, -1]`, `[3, -1]` (14)
     - Subsequences of length 3: `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 2, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 4: `[-1, 0, 2, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 5: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 6: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1]` (1)
     - Subsequences of length 7: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1, -1]` (1)
     - Total: 1 + 7 + 14 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 35
   - **Correctness**: The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has 35 increasing subsequences, not 37. This is incorrect.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the cases for \( X = 2 \), \( X = 5 \), and \( X = 13 \). However, it fails to generate the correct array for \( X = 37 \). Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.
