Output State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which must be at least \(2^{i} - 2\)), `subseq_lens` is a list containing `[i]`, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i} \leq x + 1\). Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**

The value of `i` is appended to the list `subseq_lens`, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
