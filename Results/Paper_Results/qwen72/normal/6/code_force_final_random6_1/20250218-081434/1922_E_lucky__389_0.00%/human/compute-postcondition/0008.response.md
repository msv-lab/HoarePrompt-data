The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true after the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 1)
- `i` is 1

To check if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= (x - 1) + 1` simplifies to `2 ** (i + 1) <= x`.

Since `i` is 1, the condition becomes `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x`, which simplifies to `4 <= x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be at least 4. Since `x` is already at least 1, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the condition is solely dependent on `x` and `i`.

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 4), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**
