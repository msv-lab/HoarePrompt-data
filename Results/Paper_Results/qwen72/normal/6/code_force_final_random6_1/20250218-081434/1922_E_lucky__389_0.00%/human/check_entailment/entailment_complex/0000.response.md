Reasoning:

The program aims to construct an array that has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The approach taken is to decompose \(X-1\) into a sum of distinct powers of 2, which corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by adding elements to the array. This is based on the fact that each power of 2 represents a unique combination of subsequences.

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the integer \(X\) for the current test case.
   - It subtracts 1 from \(X\) to handle the case where the empty subsequence is considered.
   - It initializes `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences and `mx` to track the maximum length.

3. **Decomposition of \(X-1\):**
   - The program iterates to find the largest \(i\) such that \(2^{i+1} \leq x + 1\).
   - It appends \(i\) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \(2^i - 1\) from \(x\).
   - This process continues until \(x\) becomes 0.

4. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It appends the elements from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element to `ansv`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Handling of \(X = 2\):**
  - For \(X = 2\), the program should output an array with exactly one element, as the empty subsequence and the single element itself form 2 increasing subsequences.
  - The current implementation will output `0` and a blank line, which is incorrect.

- **Output for No Solution:**
  - The program does not handle the case where no such array can be constructed. According to the problem statement, if no such array exists, the program should print `-1` on the first line.
  - The current implementation does not check for this and always prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements.

- **Incorrect Output for Valid Solutions:**
  - The program prints `0` and a blank line when it should print the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
