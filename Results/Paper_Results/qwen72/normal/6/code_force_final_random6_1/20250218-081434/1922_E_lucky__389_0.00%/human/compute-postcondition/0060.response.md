Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` with the elements `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]` appended to it.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The value of `x` remains 0.
- The list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which is the last index of the `subseq_lens` list.
- The variable `mx` remains the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution.
- The list `ansv` now contains all the elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the last index of `subseq_lens`.
