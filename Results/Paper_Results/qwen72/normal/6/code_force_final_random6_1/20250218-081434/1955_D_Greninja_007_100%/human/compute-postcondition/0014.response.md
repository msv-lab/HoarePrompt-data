Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is decreased by 1.**
