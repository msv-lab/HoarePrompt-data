Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `r` is `r + 1` and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is `sm - 1`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, and `ca` (except for the change in `ca[a[r - m]]`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `r` is still `r + 1` and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.
- The conditions for updating `sm` and `ans` remain the same. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is decremented by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
