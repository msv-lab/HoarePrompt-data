#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #The program returns the number of times `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these inputs to count how many times a sliding window of size `m` in the list `a` contains at least `k` elements that are also present in the list `b`. The function returns this count as an integer. The input constraints ensure that `t` is an integer within a specified range, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The lists `a` and `b` contain integers within the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the number of valid sliding windows in `a` that meet the condition.
