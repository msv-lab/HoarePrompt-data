Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`. `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`.**
