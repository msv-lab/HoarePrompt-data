The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then this condition holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold. Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.**
