Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then this condition holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold. Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.***
