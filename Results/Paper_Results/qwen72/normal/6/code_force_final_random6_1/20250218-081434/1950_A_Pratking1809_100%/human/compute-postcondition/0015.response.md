Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then this condition holds.
- Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold.
- Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The initial state provides conditions related to the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Output:
Output: **PEAK**
