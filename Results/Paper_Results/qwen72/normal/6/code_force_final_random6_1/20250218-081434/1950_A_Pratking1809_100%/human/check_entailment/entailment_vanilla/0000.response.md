### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by evaluating the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak by evaluating the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "STAIR" for a stair, "PEAK" for a peak, and "NONE" for neither, as required by the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as `0 0 0` correctly, as it will output "NONE" because neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is satisfied.
   - The program also handles cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are not in strictly increasing or decreasing order, such as `4 1 7`, which correctly outputs "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints `1 \leq t \leq 1000` and `0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9` are respected by the program. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
