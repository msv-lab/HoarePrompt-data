You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `q` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `q - 1`, and for each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold. Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by evaluating the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak by evaluating the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "STAIR" for a stair, "PEAK" for a peak, and "NONE" for neither, as required by the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as `0 0 0` correctly, as it will output "NONE" because neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is satisfied.
   - The program also handles cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are not in strictly increasing or decreasing order, such as `4 1 7`, which correctly outputs "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints `1 \leq t \leq 1000` and `0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9` are respected by the program. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.
