The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, so it must be set to 0 for the loop to begin.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
