Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- It is not the case that `a < b > c`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `q` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is explicitly set to 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided as input.
   - The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are both false. This means that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not form a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence around `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NONE'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as long as the conditions specified in the initial state are met.

Output: **NONE**
