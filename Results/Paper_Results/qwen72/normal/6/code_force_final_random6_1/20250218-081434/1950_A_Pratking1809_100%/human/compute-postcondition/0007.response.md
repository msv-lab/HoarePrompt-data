Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `q` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
4. It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
5. `a < b` and `b > c`.

### Analysis:
- The condition `a < b < c` is not true, which means that `a < b` and `b < c` cannot both be true at the same time.
- However, we are given that `a < b` and `b > c` are true.
- This implies that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the `print` statement directly, as the statement does not reference any variables or conditions from the initial state.
- The string `'PEAK'` is a constant and will be printed as is.

### Final Output:
Output: **PEAK**
