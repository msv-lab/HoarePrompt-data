The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers with a maximum value of 10^9. The function returns either `None` or the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, depending on the specific conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers (0 <= extroverts, universals <= 10^9). It returns `None` in some cases, and in other cases, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
