Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal. The introvert must be alone in a tent, and the extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. However, there is only one universal available, which is not enough to satisfy the extrovert's requirement. The program should output `-1` to indicate that it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, but it incorrectly returns `1`.
