### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Introverts must live alone in a tent.
   - Extroverts must live in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can live in any tent configuration: alone, with one other, or with two others.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3` is not zero and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means we cannot form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and universals, so we return `None`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, we add the number of tents needed for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 2 extroverts need 1 tent (with 1 universal).
     - 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 2: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 4 extroverts need 2 tents (each with 1 universal).
     - 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Case 3: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 4 extroverts need 2 tents (each with 1 universal).
     - 2 universals are enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 4: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 1 extrovert needs 1 tent (with 2 universals).
     - 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Case 5: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`**
     - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
     - 3 extroverts need 1 tent (with 0 universals).
     - 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 3 tents.
   - **Case 6: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`**
     - 19 introverts need 19 tents.
     - 7 extroverts need 3 tents (with 2 universals in each).
     - 18 universals are enough to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: 28 tents.
   - **Case 7: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`**
     - No participants, so no tents needed.
     - Total: 0 tents.
   - **Case 8: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`**
     - 7 introverts need 7 tents.
     - Total: 7 tents.
   - **Case 9: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`**
     - 24 extroverts need 8 tents (each with 3 extroverts).
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Case 10: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`**
     - 1000000000 introverts need 1000000000 tents.
     - 1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents (each with 3 extroverts).
     - 1000000000 universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - Total: 1666666667 tents.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general cases.
   - The logic for calculating the number of tents for extroverts and universals is sound.
   - The logic for combining the results with the number of tents needed for introverts is also correct.
