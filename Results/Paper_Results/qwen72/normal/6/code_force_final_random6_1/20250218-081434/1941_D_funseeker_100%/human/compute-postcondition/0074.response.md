Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `0` is no longer an element of `ans`. `m` is 0, `r` and `c` remain unchanged. `n` is now an element of `ans`.**
