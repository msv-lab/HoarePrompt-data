Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.** 

The code snippet adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `ans`, `q`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `r` and `n` are not specified in the initial state, so the specific value added to `temp` is not known, but it is the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`.
