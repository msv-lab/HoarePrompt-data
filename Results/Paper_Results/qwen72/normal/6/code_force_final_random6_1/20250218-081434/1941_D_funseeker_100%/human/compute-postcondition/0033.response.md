Postcondition: **`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. `q` is an element of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space and is now an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.**
