### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` and processes it to extract integers and strings as required.
   - The function `func_1()` reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - The function `func_2()` converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - The function `func_3()` splits the result of `func_1()` by spaces and converts each element to an integer, returning a list.
   - The function `func_4()` is the main function that processes each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then iterates over the current set of possible positions `ans`.
   - For each position `q`:
     - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all possible positions for the current throw, it updates `ans` to `temp`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the position `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because in a circular arrangement, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible positions.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling**: The input handling functions are correctly implemented to read and process the input as described in the problem.
- **Correctness of Position Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the new positions for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
  - The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in a circular arrangement.
  - The handling of the '?' direction is also correct, as it considers both possible directions.
- **Correctness of Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where position `0` is equivalent to position `n` by removing `0` and adding `n` to the set.
- **Correctness of Output**: The program correctly prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of possible positions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
