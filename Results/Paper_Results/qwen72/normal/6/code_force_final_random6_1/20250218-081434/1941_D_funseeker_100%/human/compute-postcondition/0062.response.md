Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` includes the new element `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged. `temp` now includes the new element `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state specified that `temp` might include a new element `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', but this condition does not affect the current operation. Therefore, the new element `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`, and all other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
