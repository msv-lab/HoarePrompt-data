You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `m` is 0, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. If `0` is in the original `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. `m` is 0, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set resulting from the operations described in the initial state)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted(ans) (where `ans` is the set of unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or unique values of `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1', with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` is in the original `ans`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n, and returns a value based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
