Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is the first element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.***
