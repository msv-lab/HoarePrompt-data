Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.***
