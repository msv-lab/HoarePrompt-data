Postcondition: ***`ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. If `0` is in the original `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. `m` is 0, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.***
