Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are now the values returned by `func_3()`.** 

The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `x` (which were integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n) are no longer relevant. The new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are determined by the values returned by the function `func_3()`.
