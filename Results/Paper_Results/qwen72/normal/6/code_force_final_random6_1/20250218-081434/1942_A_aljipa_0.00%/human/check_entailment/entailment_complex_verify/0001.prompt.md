You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `k` is the input integer from the last iteration, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or `[-1]` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. The function then prints a list `res` based on the following conditions: if `k == n`, it prints a list of `n` ones; if `k == 1`, it prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, it prints `[-1]`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` which represent the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts, respectively.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - The program handles three specific cases:
     - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
       - If `k` is equal to `n`, the program constructs an array `res` with `n` elements, all set to 1.
       - This is correct because an array with all elements equal will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
     - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
       - If `k` is equal to 1, the program constructs an array `res` with elements from 0 to `n-1` using `range(n)`.
       - This is correct because an array with distinct elements in increasing order will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
     - **Case 3: `k != 1 and k != n`**:
       - If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, the program outputs `-1`.
       - This is incorrect because it does not consider other possible values of `k` that might still allow for a valid array. For example, if `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]` for `n = 3`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of the array `res` using the `print(*res)` syntax, which correctly unpacks the list and prints the elements separated by spaces.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` is neither 1 nor `n` properly. It should be able to generate a valid array for other values of `k` as well.
