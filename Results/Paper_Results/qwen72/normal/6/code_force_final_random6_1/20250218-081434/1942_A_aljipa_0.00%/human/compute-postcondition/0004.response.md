Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `res` is a list that is determined based on the values of `n` and `k`:
  - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k == 1`, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `res` based on the conditions:**
   - If `k == n`, `res` will be a list of `n` ones. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 5`, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - If `k == 1`, `res` will be a range from 0 to `n-1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 1`, `res` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Otherwise, `res` will be `[-1]`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 2`, `res` will be `[-1]`.

2. **Print the elements of `res` using the `*` operator:**
   - The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `res` and prints each element separated by a space.
   - If `res` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the output will be `1 1 1 1 1`.
   - If `res` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be `0 1 2 3 4`.
   - If `res` is `[-1]`, the output will be `-1`.

### Final Output:
- If `k == n`, the output will be a sequence of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k == n, where the list contains n ones)**  
Output: **[0 1 2 ... (n-1)] (if k == 1, where the list contains integers from 0 to n-1)**  
Output: **-1 (otherwise)**
