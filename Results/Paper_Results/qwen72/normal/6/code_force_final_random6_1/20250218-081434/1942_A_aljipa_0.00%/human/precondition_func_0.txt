The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
