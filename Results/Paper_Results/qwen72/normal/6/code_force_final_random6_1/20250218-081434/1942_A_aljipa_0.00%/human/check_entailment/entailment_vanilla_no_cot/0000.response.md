Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Case for \( k = n \)**:
   - The program correctly outputs an array of `1` repeated `n` times, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.

2. **Case for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program outputs the range from `0` to `n-1`, which is not a valid solution. The problem specifies that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), but the range starts from `0`. Additionally, the range `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will not necessarily have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. For example, if \( n = 3 \), the array `[0, 1, 2]` has three sorted cyclic shifts: `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`.

3. **Case for \( 1 < k < n \)**:
   - The program outputs `-1` for any \( k \) that is not \( 1 \) or \( n \). This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for these cases. For example, for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to handle the following cases:

- **If \( k = n \)**: Output an array of `1` repeated `n` times.
- **If \( k = 1 \)**: Output an array where the first element is the largest and the rest are in increasing order, such as `[10^9, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
- **If \( 1 < k < n \)**: Construct an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order and the remaining \( n - k \) elements are all the same and larger than the last element of the first \( k \) elements. For example, `[1, 2, ..., k, 10^9, 10^9, ..., 10^9]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = [10**9] + list(range(1, n))
        elif k < n:
            res = list(range(1, k + 1)) + [10**9] * (n - k)
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)

func()
```

This program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem.
