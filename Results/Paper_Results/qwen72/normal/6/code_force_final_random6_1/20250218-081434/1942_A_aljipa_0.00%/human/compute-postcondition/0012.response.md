Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - `res` is a list defined based on the values of `n` and `k`:
     - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
     - If `k == 1`, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*res)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the list `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.

4. **Possible Cases:**
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**
     - `res` will be a list of `n` ones.
     - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 5`, then `res = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - Output: **1 1 1 1 1**
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**
     - `res` will be a range from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 1`, then `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - Output: **0 1 2 3 4**
   - **Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1`**
     - `res` will be `[-1]`.
     - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 3`, then `res = [-1]`.
     - Output: **-1**

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we need to consider all possible cases. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions given:

- If `k == n`, the output will be a sequence of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k == n, where the list contains n ones)**
Output: **[0 1 2 ... n-1] (if k == 1, where the list contains integers from 0 to n-1)**
Output: **-1 (if k != n and k != 1)**
