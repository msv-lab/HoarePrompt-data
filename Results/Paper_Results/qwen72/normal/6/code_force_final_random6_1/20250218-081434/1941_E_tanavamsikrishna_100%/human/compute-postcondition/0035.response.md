To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Condition**:
   - The condition checks if the index of the tuple `e` (which is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`.
   - `i` is `d + 2`.
   - `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements.

3. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the index of the tuple `e` (which is `e[1]`) must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Given `i` is `d + 2`, the condition simplifies to `e[1] <= (d + 2) - (d + 2)`, which is `e[1] <= 0`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The current state already mentions that `min_heap` contains at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`.
   - Therefore, the condition `e[1] <= 0` is already satisfied with the current state.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `e[1] <= 0` is already met with the current state, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements.**
