### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for installing supports in a single row.
   - The function starts by setting the cost of the first cell to 1 (since \( a_{i,1} = 0 \) and the cost is \( a_{i,1} + 1 \)).
   - It then iterates through the first \( d \) cells, adding 2 to each cell's depth (since the cost is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \) and we need to add 1 for the support and 1 for the bridge itself).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the first \( d \) cells.
   - For each subsequent cell, the function ensures that the distance between the current cell and the closest support is no more than \( d \) by popping elements from the heap until the condition is met.
   - The cost for the current cell is then calculated as the minimum cost from the heap plus the cost of the current cell.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), the number of bridges \( k \), and the maximum distance \( d \).
   - It reads the grid and calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building \( k \) consecutive bridges by summing the costs of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function correctly initializes the first cell's cost to 1.
     - It correctly adds 2 to the costs of the first \( d \) cells.
     - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for the current cell is always chosen, and the distance condition is maintained.
     - The function correctly returns the cost of the last cell.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It correctly calculates the total cost for \( k \) consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
     - The function prints the correct output for each test case.
