You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

- Program:
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush
#Function 1:
def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
    min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):

    print(min(total_costs))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from standard input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` integers, to form a list of lists called `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` represents the depths of the river cells in a row, with the first and last elements being 0. The function computes the cost for each row using the `func_1` function and stores these costs in a list called `costs`. It then calculates the sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs` and stores these sums in a list called `total_costs`. Finally, the function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for installing supports in a single row.
   - The function starts by setting the cost of the first cell to 1 (since \( a_{i,1} = 0 \) and the cost is \( a_{i,1} + 1 \)).
   - It then iterates through the first \( d \) cells, adding 2 to each cell's depth (since the cost is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \) and we need to add 1 for the support and 1 for the bridge itself).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the first \( d \) cells.
   - For each subsequent cell, the function ensures that the distance between the current cell and the closest support is no more than \( d \) by popping elements from the heap until the condition is met.
   - The cost for the current cell is then calculated as the minimum cost from the heap plus the cost of the current cell.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), the number of bridges \( k \), and the maximum distance \( d \).
   - It reads the grid and calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building \( k \) consecutive bridges by summing the costs of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function correctly initializes the first cell's cost to 1.
     - It correctly adds 2 to the costs of the first \( d \) cells.
     - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for the current cell is always chosen, and the distance condition is maintained.
     - The function correctly returns the cost of the last cell.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It correctly calculates the total cost for \( k \) consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
     - The function prints the correct output for each test case.
