Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0, `xor` is 0 if the last element of `cur_arr` resulted in `xor` having the bit at position `bit` set to 0, otherwise `xor` is the final value after all elements of `cur_arr` have been processed, and `thing1` is 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- `cur_arr` remains the same as it was initially, a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` remains the same as it was initially, an integer between 0 and 29 (inclusive).
- `new_arr` contains the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0.
- `xor` is 0 if the last element of `cur_arr` resulted in `xor` having the bit at position `bit` set to 0. Otherwise, `xor` is the final value after processing all elements of `cur_arr`.
- `thing1` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
