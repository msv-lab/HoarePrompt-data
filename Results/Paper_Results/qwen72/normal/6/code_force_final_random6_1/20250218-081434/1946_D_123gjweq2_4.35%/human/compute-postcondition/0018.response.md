Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `xor` is updated to be the result of the XOR operation between `xor` and `i`.
- Since `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, the new value of `xor` is `0` XOR `i`, which is simply `i`.
- All other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `thing1`) retain their initial values.
