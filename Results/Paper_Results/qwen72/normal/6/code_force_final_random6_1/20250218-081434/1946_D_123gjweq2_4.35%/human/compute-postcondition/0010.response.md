Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, and the bit at position `bit` in `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `xor = 0` sets the variable `xor` to 0.
- The initial state specifies that `xor` was initially the first element of `cur_arr`, but after the code execution, `xor` is now 0.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
