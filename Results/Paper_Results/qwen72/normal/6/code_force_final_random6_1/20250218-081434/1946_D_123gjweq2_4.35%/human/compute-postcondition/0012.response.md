To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `cur_arr`. The loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.

Let's break down the current state and the necessary adjustments:

- **`cur_arr`**: A list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element.
- **`i`**: The first element in `cur_arr`.
- **`bit`**: An integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.
- **`new_arr`**: A list that may contain the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in `i` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list.
- **`xor`**: The result of `i` XOR `0` (which is `i`).
- **`thing1`**: 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`.
- `cur_arr` must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be the next element in `cur_arr`.
- `cur_arr` must have at least 2 elements (since the loop has already processed the first element).

The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that may contain the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is the first element of `cur_arr`, and `thing1` is 0**
