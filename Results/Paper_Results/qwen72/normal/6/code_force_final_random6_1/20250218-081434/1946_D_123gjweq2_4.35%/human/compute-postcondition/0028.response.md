Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, and `thing1` is -1. Additionally, the current value of `x` has the bit at position `bit` set to 1.**
