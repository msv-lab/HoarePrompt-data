Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `xor = 0` sets the variable `xor` to 0.
- The initial state variables `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `thing1` remain unchanged.
- `cur_arr` is still a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is still the third element in `cur_arr`.
- `bit` is still an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.
- `new_arr` still contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise it contains the value of `xor`.
- `thing1` remains 0.
