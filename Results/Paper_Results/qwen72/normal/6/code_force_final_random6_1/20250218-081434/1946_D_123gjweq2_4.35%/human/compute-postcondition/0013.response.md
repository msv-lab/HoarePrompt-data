Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that may contain the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is the result of the first element of `cur_arr` XORed with the second element of `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `xor` is updated to be the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and the second element of `cur_arr` (which is `i`).
- All other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `thing1`) remain unchanged.
