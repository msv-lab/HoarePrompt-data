To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `not vis[s]` is true, meaning the elements at the positions `s[0]` and `s[1]` in the list `vis` are both 0.
2. `k > 0` is true, meaning `k` is a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`.
- `p` contains unique integers from 1 to `n`.
- `a` contains positive integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9).
- `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ `s[0]`, `s[1]` ≤ `n`).
- `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9).
- `n` is the length of the list `p`.
- `mx` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `not vis[s]`**:
   - `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `s` is a list of two integers, each between 1 and `n`.
   - Since `vis` is initially all zeros, `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are both 0.
   - Therefore, `not vis[s]` is true because `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are both 0.

2. **Condition `k > 0`**:
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - Given the initial state, `k` is already a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9).
   - Therefore, `k > 0` is true.

Since both conditions are already true based on the initial state, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ `s[0]`, `s[1]` ≤ `n`). `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9). `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
