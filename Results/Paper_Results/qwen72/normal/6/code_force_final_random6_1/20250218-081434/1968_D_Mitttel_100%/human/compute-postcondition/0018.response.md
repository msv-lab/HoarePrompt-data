Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is now a list containing the integers at indices `s[0]` and `s[1]` in `p` that have not been visited yet. `k` is now `k - 2` and must be greater than 0. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is now `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`. `cur` is now `a[s]`. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 1, and all other elements are 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `cur + k * a[s]`.
- The values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `cur`, and `vis` remain the same as in the initial state, except for the updated value of `mx`.
