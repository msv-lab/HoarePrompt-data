Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ `s[0]`, `s[1]` ≤ `n`). `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9). `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `vis` with `n` elements, all set to 0. This list is used to track the visited positions. The other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
