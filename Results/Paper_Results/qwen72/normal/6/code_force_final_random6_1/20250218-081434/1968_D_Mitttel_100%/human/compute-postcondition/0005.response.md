Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ `s[0]`, `s[1]` ≤ `n`). `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9). `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[s[0] - 1]` and `vis[s[1] - 1]` are 1, and all other elements are 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis[s] = 1` updates the `vis` list at the indices specified by `s[0] - 1` and `s[1] - 1` to 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
- The `vis` list, which was initially a list of `n` zeros, now has 1s at the positions `s[0] - 1` and `s[1] - 1`.
