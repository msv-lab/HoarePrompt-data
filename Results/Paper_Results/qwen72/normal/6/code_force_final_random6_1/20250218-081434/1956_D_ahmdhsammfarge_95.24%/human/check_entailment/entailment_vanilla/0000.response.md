### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray `a[l:r]`, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in this subarray to the MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function aims to find the subarray `a[l:r]` that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - The MEX of a subarray is approximated as `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
     - The function returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray `a[r:l+1]` to the same value.
     - It is not clear why this function is necessary, as it does not compute the MEX or update the array.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function updates the array `lst` and the list of operations `ops` to set the subarray `a[r:l+1]` to the MEX value.
     - It appends the operation to `ops` and then updates the subarray in `lst` to the MEX value.
     - The MEX value is approximated as `n` (the length of the subarray), which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The MEX calculation is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
     - This function does not correctly identify the subarray that maximizes the sum.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function does not contribute to the correct solution. It recursively adds operations without computing the MEX or updating the array.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - The MEX calculation is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not `n`.
     - The function updates the array and operations but does not ensure the correct MEX value is used.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it uses incorrect methods to compute the MEX and does not ensure the operations are performed correctly to maximize the sum of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**
