Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to maximize the sum, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range. The MEX value is not considered in the sum calculation, which is a critical part of the problem description. Additionally, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not correctly structured to perform the operations as described. For example, the function `func_3` modifies the list and appends operations to `ops` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

A specific case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
3
1 3 9

Expected Output:
13 0

Actual Output:
The program does not correctly compute the MEX value and may produce an incorrect sequence of operations or sum.
```

The program should be able to handle all potential cases, including those where the MEX value is crucial for maximizing the sum. Since the provided code does not correctly handle the MEX computation and the sequence of operations, it is incorrect.
