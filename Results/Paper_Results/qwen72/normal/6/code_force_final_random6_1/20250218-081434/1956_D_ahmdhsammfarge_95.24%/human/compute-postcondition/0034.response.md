Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 4 < n â‰¤ 18, `r` is [1, 4], `l` is 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 25, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the list `[i, j]` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, `r` becomes `[1, 4]` and `l` becomes 4.
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `sm` and `over_sum` remain as they were in the initial state.
