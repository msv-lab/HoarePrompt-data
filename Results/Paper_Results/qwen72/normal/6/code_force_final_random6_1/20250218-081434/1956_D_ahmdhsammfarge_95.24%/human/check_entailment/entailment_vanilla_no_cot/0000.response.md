Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing**: The program does not calculate the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is a crucial part of the problem, and the program should determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray before applying the operation.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` attempts to find the subarray that maximizes the sum after the operation, but it incorrectly calculates the sum. The sum should be the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the MEX of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray, not the square of the length of the subarray.

3. **Recursive Function `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is intended to append operations, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the actual transformation of the array. It seems to be appending operations in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Incorrect Transformation in `func_3`**: The function `func_3` attempts to transform the subarray, but it does not correctly calculate the MEX. It also appends operations in a way that does not make sense for the problem.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you should:

1. **Calculate the MEX of a Subarray**: Write a function to calculate the MEX of a given subarray.
2. **Determine the Optimal Subarray**: Iterate over all possible subarrays to find the one that maximizes the sum after applying the operation.
3. **Apply the Operation**: Apply the operation to the subarray and update the array.
4. **Repeat the Process**: Repeat the process until no more operations can improve the sum or the number of operations exceeds the limit.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex = 0
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def maximize_sum(a):
    n = len(a)
    max_sum = sum(a)
    operations = []
    
    for _ in range(5 * 10**5):
        best_sum = max_sum
        best_l = best_r = -1
        
        for l in range(n):
            for r in range(l, n):
                subarray = a[l:r+1]
                current_mex = mex(subarray)
                new_sum = sum(a[:l]) + sum(a[r+1:]) + (r - l + 1) * current_mex
                
                if new_sum > best_sum:
                    best_sum = new_sum
                    best_l, best_r = l, r
        
        if best_sum == max_sum:
            break
        
        max_sum = best_sum
        operations.append([best_l + 1, best_r + 1])
        a[best_l:best_r+1] = [mex(a[best_l:best_r+1])] * (best_r - best_l + 1)
    
    return max_sum, operations

# Example usage:
n = 4
a = [1, 100, 2, 1]
max_sum, operations = maximize_sum(a)
print(max_sum, len(operations))
for op in operations:
    print(op[0], op[1])
```

This solution correctly calculates the MEX, determines the optimal subarray to maximize the sum, and applies the operations accordingly.
