Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The operations are limited to no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function identifies the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX value, maximizes the sum of the array. It does this by iterating over all possible subarrays and calculating the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX value. The function returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes this sum.
   - **func_2**: This function recursively appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. It ensures that the operations are recorded for the subarray from `r` to `l`.
   - **func_3**: This function performs the actual operation on the array. It appends the operation range to `ops`, checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0, and then fills the subarray with the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray (`n`).

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The main logic starts by reading the input array and initializing an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum.
   - If `r` is not equal to `l`, it repeatedly calls `func_3` to perform the operation and update the array and `ops` list until no more operations can be performed.
   - After the main loop, it checks for any remaining 0s in the array and replaces them with 1, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1** correctly identifies the subarray that maximizes the sum when replaced with its MEX value. The MEX value for a subarray is the length of the subarray, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - **func_2** ensures that the operations are recorded correctly, even though it seems to append the same operation multiple times, which is not necessary for the problem but does not violate the constraints.
   - **func_3** correctly performs the operation by replacing the subarray with its MEX value and updating the `ops` list. It also handles the case where the minimum value in the subarray is 0 by appending additional operations.
   - The main logic ensures that the operations are performed in a way that maximizes the sum of the array and does not exceed the operation limit.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array is already optimal (no operations needed) by not performing any operations.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains 0s by replacing them with 1s in the final step, ensuring the maximum possible sum.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
