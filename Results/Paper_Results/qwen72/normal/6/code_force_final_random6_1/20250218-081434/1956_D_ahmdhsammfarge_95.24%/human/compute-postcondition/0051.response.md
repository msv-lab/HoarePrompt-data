Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 6 to the end of `lst` plus 16. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` and `l` is 4. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 6 to the end of `lst` plus 16 (since `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `4 ** 2` which is 16).
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 2 and 5, respectively.
- The value of `over_sum` and `l` will be updated based on the comparison between the new `sm` and the current `over_sum`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` and `l` is set to 4. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains the same and `l` is set to 3.
