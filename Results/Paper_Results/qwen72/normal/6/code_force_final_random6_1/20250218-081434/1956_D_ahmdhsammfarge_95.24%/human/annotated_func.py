    #The program returns the starting index `r` and the ending index `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the subarray's length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers with a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18. It returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the starting index `r` and the ending index `l` of the subarray that, when removed, maximizes the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the subarray's length. The input list `lst` remains unchanged.

    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l`, and a list `ops`. It ensures that `0 <= r <= l < n`. If `r` equals `l`, it appends the pair `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and returns. If `r` is not equal to `l`, it recursively calls itself twice with the parameters `r` and `l - 1`, and appends the pair `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` between the recursive calls. The function does not return any value, but modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers. After the function concludes, `ops` contains multiple pairs `[r + 1, l + 1]` for each valid `r` and `l` combination, where `r` is less than or equal to `l`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: *`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation, and `ops` now includes an additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and `ops` still includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst`, where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` has been filled with the value `n`, and `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is `n`, and the list `ops` now includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, where `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of operation ranges. It appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends the same range again. The function then calls another function `func_2` with `r`, `l`, and `ops`. Finally, it fills the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` with the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`, ensuring the minimum value in this sublist is `n`. The function returns the modified `lst`.
