Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, and `i` is 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0 or [1, 2], `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied or 2, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm > over_sum`, `r` is set to [1, 2], `l` is set to 2, and `over_sum` is updated to the current value of `sm`. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0 or [1, 2] if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, otherwise `r` is [1, 3]. `l` is 2 if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, otherwise `l` is 3. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`. `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 16.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 4 < n ≤ 18, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 25, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is [1, 4] and `l` is 4. Otherwise, `r` is 0 or [1, 2] if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, and `l` is 2 if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
