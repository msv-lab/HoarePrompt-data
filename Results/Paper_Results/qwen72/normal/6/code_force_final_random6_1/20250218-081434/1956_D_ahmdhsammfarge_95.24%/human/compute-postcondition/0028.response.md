Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0 or [1, 2], `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied or 2, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 16.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` (which is `lst[0]` since `i` is 1), plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` (which is `sum(lst[4:])` since `j` is 3), plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` (which is `3 ** 2` or 9, but actually 16 because it should be `(3 - 1 + 1) ** 2` which is `3 ** 2` or 16).
- The values of `lst`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst`, the sum of the elements from index 4 to the end of `lst`, plus 16.
