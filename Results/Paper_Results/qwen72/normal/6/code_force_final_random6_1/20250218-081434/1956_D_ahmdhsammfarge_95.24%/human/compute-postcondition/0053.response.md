Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 6 to the end of `lst` plus 16, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `l` is 5, `r` is 2.** 

The value of `over_sum` is now equal to the value of `sm`, which is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 6 to the end of `lst` plus 16. All other variables remain unchanged.
