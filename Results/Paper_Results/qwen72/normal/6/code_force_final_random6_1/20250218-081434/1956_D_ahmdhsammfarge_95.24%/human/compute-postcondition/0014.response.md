To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `lst`. The loop head is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Let's break down the state adjustments step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18.
   - `r` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.
   - If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 1) up to `len(lst) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.
   - The length of `lst` remains the same, so `len(lst)` is still `n`.

4. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `lst` remains a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `r` remains 0.
   - `sm` remains `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.
   - The condition for `l` remains the same: if `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.**
