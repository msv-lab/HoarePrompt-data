Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- It is not the case that `a < b and b > c`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will print the string 'NONE' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` because the conditions provided do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is a simple string output and does not involve any variables or conditions from the initial state.

Output: **NONE**
