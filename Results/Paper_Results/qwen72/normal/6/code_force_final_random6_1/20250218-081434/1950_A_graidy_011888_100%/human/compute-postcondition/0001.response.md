To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n)` function and will start at 0 for the first iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The other variables mentioned in the state (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
