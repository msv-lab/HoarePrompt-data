Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and if `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.***
