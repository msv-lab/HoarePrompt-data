The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates with an integer `t` and three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9) for each test case. The function returns a value that is determined by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, but the specific output based on these inputs is not provided in the constraints.

Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the parameters and the general nature of the function's expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) for each test case. It returns a value based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the specific output is not defined in the given constraints.**
