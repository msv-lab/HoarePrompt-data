The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then evaluates the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
