Reasoning:
The program provided is designed to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads three digits and checks if they form a "STAIR" or a "PEAK" based on the conditions given in the problem statement. The conditions are:
- A "STAIR" if \( a < b < c \)
- A "PEAK" if \( a < b \) and \( b > c \)
- "NONE" otherwise

The program correctly implements these conditions using the following logic:
- It first checks if \( a < b < c \) to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
- If the first condition is not met, it checks if \( a < b \) and \( b > c \) to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
- If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The program's structure and logic are consistent with the problem requirements, and it handles the input and output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
