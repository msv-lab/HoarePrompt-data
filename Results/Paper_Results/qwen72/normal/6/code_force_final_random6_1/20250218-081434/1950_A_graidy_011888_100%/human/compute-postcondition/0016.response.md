Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
   - Otherwise, if `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds.
   - If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('NONE')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('NONE')` will always execute because it does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'NONE'` is a constant and will be printed regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NONE**
