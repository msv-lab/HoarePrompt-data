The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several conditions involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`:
  - If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
  - If `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds.
  - If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.
- The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- The variable `n` is greater than 2.
- The variable `i` is 2.
- However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these conditions or variables. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
