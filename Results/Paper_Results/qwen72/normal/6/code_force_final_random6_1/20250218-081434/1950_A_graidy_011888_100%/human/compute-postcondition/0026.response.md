Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, `n` is the input integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, if `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b and b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` holds. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds, then neither of these conditions is true.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input for each iteration, and `n` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, the conditions checked within the loop (whether `a < b < c`, `a < b and b > c`, or neither) will have been evaluated and the corresponding output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') will have been printed based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for that iteration.
