Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases, `n`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a "stair" and a "peak" as described in the problem statement. The logic is as follows:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The conditions are correctly implemented and cover all possible cases for the given problem. The program also handles the input and output format as specified. There are no logical errors or issues with the conditions provided.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
