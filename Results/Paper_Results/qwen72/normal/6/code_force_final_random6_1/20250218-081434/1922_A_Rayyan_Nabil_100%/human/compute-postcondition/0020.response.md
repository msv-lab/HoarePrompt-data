Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented `t` times, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last stripped input string, `b` is the last stripped input string, `c` is the last stripped input string.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, but the list `results` now contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1` with the inputs provided during each iteration. The placeholder variable `_` has been incremented `t` times, and the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
