Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string.** 

The value of `c` is updated to a new input string that has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. All other variables remain unchanged.
