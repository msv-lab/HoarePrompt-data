The loop head contains the variables `result` and `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. The placeholder variable `_` and the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `results` is a list containing `t` results, the list `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, `results` must be a list with at least one result, and `result` will be the first element of `results` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the first element of `results`**
