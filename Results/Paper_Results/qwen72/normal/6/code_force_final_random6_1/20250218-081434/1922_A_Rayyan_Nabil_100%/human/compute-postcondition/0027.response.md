Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the last element of `results`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as the initial input integer, and the `results` list still contains `t` results, where each result is the output of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration. The variable `result` will be the last element in the `results` list, which is the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` from the last iteration of the loop. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.
