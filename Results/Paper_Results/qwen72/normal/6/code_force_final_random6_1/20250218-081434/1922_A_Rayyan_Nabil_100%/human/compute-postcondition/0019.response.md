Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))` appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`.
- The value of `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The list `results` now contains one additional result from the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `_` is one more than its previous value.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their new values as specified in the initial state.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` remains valid.
