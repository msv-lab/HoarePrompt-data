Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, with the addition that `total_space` is now equal to the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`. Since `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`.
