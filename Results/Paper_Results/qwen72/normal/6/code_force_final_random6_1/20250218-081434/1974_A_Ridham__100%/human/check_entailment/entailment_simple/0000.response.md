### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The total space required for 1x1 icons is `space_x = x * 1`.
   - The total space required for 2x2 icons is `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to ensure all 2x2 icons are placed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - The number of additional screens is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)`.
   - The total number of screens required is then `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons by ensuring that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and calculating the number of screens required based on the parity of `y`.
- The program then correctly calculates the remaining cells on the screens and checks if the 1x1 icons can fit within these remaining cells.
- If the 1x1 icons cannot fit, it calculates the additional screens required and adds this to the total number of screens.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** `x = 0, y = 0` (No icons at all)
  - The program correctly outputs `0` screens.
- **Case 2:** `x = 15, y = 0` (Only 1x1 icons)
  - The program correctly outputs `1` screen.
- **Case 3:** `x = 0, y = 1` (Only one 2x2 icon)
  - The program correctly outputs `1` screen.
- **Case 4:** `x = 1, y = 1` (One 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon)
  - The program correctly outputs `1` screen.
- **Case 5:** `x = 1, y = 2` (One 1x1 icon and two 2x2 icons)
  - The program correctly outputs `1` screen.
- **Case 6:** `x = 12, y = 4` (Multiple 1x1 and 2x2 icons)
  - The program correctly outputs `2` screens.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the given test cases and edge cases correctly. It follows the logic of placing 2x2 icons first and then fitting 1x1 icons into the remaining space, and it calculates the total number of screens required accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
