Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is a list. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4)`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.** 

Explanation:
- The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `x` and `y`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `screen_require_for_y` and `remaining_cells` based on whether `y` is even or odd still hold.
- The logic for determining the contents of `result` based on `space_x` and `remaining_cells` also remains valid.
