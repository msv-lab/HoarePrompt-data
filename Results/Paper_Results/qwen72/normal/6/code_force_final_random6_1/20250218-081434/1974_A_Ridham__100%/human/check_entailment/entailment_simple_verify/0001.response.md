### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires placing `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - It calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It then determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - It calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
   - If the remaining cells are enough to place all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not enough, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` is the space still needed for 1x1 icons.
     - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, the additional screens required is `extra_space // 15`.
     - Otherwise, it is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.
   - It then appends the total number of screens required (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `x = 0` and `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` screens.
   - If `x = 0` and `y > 0`, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
   - If `x > 0` and `y = 0`, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are non-zero, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for both types of icons.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the test case `1 1`:
     - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`, `total_space = 5`.
     - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y = 1` is odd).
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`.
     - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is true, so it outputs `1`.
   - For the test case `12 4`:
     - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`, `total_space = 28`.
     - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y = 4` is even).
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`.
     - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is true, so it outputs `2`.
   - For the test case `0 9`:
     - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 36`, `total_space = 36`.
     - `screen_require_for_y = 5` (since `y = 9` is odd).
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * 5 - 36 = 39`.
     - `space_x <= remaining_cells` is true, so it outputs `5`.

5. **Challenges and Considerations:**
   - The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons by calculating the number of screens required based on the parity of `y`.
   - The program correctly calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for 1x1 icons.
   - The program correctly calculates the additional screens required for 1x1 icons if the remaining cells are not enough.

6. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The program's logic is sound and follows the problem constraints.
   - The program handles all edge cases and the example provided correctly.
   - The annotations and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.
