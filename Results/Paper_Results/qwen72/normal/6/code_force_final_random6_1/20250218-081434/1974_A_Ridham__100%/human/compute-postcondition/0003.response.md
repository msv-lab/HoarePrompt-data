Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list.** 

The user input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.
