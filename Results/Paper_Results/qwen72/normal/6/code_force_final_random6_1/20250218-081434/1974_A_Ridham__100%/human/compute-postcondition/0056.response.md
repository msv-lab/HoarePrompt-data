Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each of the `n` test cases. For each test case, if `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (which is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y` (which is `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd). If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000. The variables `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input for each test case. The variable `n` is the total number of test cases processed. The list `result` contains the number of screens required for each test case, calculated based on the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration. For each test case, if the space required for `x` (which is `x` itself) is less than or equal to the remaining cells (which is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), the number of screens required for `y` (which is `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd) is appended to `result`. If the space required for `x` is greater than the remaining cells, the number of additional screens required for the extra space (calculated as `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise) is added to the number of screens required for `y`, and this total is appended to `result`.
