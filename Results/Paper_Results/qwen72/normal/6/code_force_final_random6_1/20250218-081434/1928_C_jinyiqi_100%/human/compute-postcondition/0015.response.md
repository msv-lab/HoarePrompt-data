Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`. `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, or equal to the square root if `x` is a perfect square.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `x` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The list `output1` contains all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`. For example, if `x` is 12, `output1` will contain `[1, 2, 3]` because these are the divisors of 12 that are ≤ √12.
- The list `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, or equal to the square root if `x` is a perfect square. For example, if `x` is 12, `output2` will contain `[12, 6, 4]` because these are the divisors of 12 that are > √12, and they correspond to the divisors in `output1`. If `x` is a perfect square, like 16, `output2` will contain `[16, 8, 4]` because 4 is the square root and is included in both lists.
