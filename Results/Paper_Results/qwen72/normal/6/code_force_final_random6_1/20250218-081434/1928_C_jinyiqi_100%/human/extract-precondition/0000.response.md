Precondition: **x is an integer such that 1 \le x \le 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, x):
```

Given this, the correct precondition for the function `func_1(n, x)` is:

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 \le x < n \le 10^9.**
