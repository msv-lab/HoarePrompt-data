You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines all the divisors of `x` greater than or equal to the square root of `x` (from `output2`) with all the divisors of `x` less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order (from `output1`). The resulting list contains all divisors of `x` in descending order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the valid values of \( k \) is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Logic for Finding Divisors**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a given number \( x \). However, it appends the divisors in a way that can lead to duplicates. For example, if \( x = 16 \), the divisors are \( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 \), but the function will return \( [16, 8, 4, 2, 1] \) and \( [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] \), which are redundant.

2. **Handling of \( k \) Values**:
   - The program checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) to determine potential \( k \) values. However, it does not correctly filter out invalid \( k \) values.
   - For example, consider the input \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \). The program should output 4 valid \( k \) values (2, 3, 5, 6), but it may not correctly handle all edge cases and constraints.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( n \) and \( x \) are such that no valid \( k \) exists. For example, \( n = 100 \) and \( x = 99 \) should output 0, but the program may not correctly handle this.

4. **Redundant Operations**:
   - The program appends potential \( k \) values to a list and then converts it to a set to remove duplicates. This is inefficient and can be simplified.

To ensure correctness, the program should:
- Correctly find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) without duplicates.
- Filter out invalid \( k \) values based on the problem constraints.
- Handle edge cases where no valid \( k \) exists.

A more correct approach would involve:
- Finding all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) in a single pass.
- Ensuring that each \( k \) is greater than 1 and fits the pattern described in the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def count_valid_ks(t, test_cases):
    def find_divisors(x):
        divisors = set()
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                divisors.add(i)
                divisors.add(x // i)
        return divisors

    results = []
    for n, x in test_cases:
        valid_ks = set()
        for k in find_divisors(n + x - 2):
            if k > 1 and (k + 2) // 2 >= x:
                valid_ks.add((k + 2) // 2)
        for k in find_divisors(n - x):
            if k > 1 and (k + 2) // 2 >= x:
                valid_ks.add((k + 2) // 2)
        results.append(len(valid_ks))
    return results

t = int(input())
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]
results = count_valid_ks(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that all potential \( k \) values are correctly identified and filtered, and it handles edge cases appropriately.
