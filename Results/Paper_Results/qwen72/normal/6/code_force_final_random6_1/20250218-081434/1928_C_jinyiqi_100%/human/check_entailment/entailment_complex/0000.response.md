### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit a specific pattern of numbering in a line.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence.
   - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to find all \( k \) such that the pattern fits the given constraints.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).
   - It then calls `func_1` with \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) to find the divisors of these values.
   - The divisors are checked to see if they can form a valid \( k \) and if \( k \geq x \).
   - The valid \( k \) values are collected in a list `output`, and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - Finally, the length of the `output` list is printed, which represents the number of valid \( k \) values.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` returns all divisors of \( x \) in descending order.
   - It does this by iterating up to the square root of \( x \) and checking for divisors.
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), both \( i \) and \( x / i \) are added to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - The lists are then combined and returned in descending order.

4. **Logic for Valid \( k \)**:
   - The program checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - If they are, it finds the divisors of these values using `func_1`.
   - For each divisor \( s \), it checks if \( (s + 2) \) is even and if \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - If both conditions are met, \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is added to the `output` list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \).

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly filters and checks the divisors to ensure they form valid \( k \) values.
   - The program removes duplicates and counts the number of valid \( k \) values.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
