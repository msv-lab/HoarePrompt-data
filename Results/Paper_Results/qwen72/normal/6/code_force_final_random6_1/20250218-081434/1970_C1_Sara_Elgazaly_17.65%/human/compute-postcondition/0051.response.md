Postcondition: ***`lst[x]` is an empty list, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial values, `s` is the opposite of its initial value, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before it became empty. If `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is now equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
