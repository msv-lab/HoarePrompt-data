#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) representing the number of rounds, a list of n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    lst = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst[a].append(b)
        
        lst[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, and `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations.
    s = True
    while lst[x] != []:
        while lst[x]:
            y = lst[x].pop()
            if lst[y] != []:
                x = y
                break
        
        s = not s
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when `lst[x]` becomes an empty list. At this point, `x` will be the last value of `y` that caused the loop to break, and `lst[x]` will be an empty list. The variables `a`, `b`, and `_` will remain unchanged from their initial values. `s` will be `True` if the loop executed an even number of times, and `False` if the loop executed an odd number of times.
    s = not s
    print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')
    #This is printed: 'Hermione' if the loop executed an odd number of times, or 'Ron' if the loop executed an even number of times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to construct a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. It then performs a traversal starting from a specified node `u_1`. The traversal continues until it reaches a leaf node, toggling a boolean variable `s` with each step. The function prints 'Hermione' if the number of steps taken is odd, and 'Ron' if the number of steps taken is even. The function does not return any value.
