Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed in several ways:

1. **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if each character in the set `us` appears in the string `s` and tries to form a subsequence of length `n` by adding characters to `ans` when the set `win` contains all `k` characters. This approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are checked.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program generates a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a character that is not in `win`. This does not necessarily produce a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is greater than `m` or where `k` is 1. For example, if `n = 3`, `k = 1`, and `m = 2` with `s = "aa"`, the program should output `NO` and a missing subsequence like `"aaa"`, but it does not.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
3 2 5
ababa

Expected Output:
NO
aab

Actual Output:
NO
```

The program outputs `NO` but does not provide a correct missing subsequence. The correct missing subsequence in this case should be `"aab"`, which is not a subsequence of `ababa`.
