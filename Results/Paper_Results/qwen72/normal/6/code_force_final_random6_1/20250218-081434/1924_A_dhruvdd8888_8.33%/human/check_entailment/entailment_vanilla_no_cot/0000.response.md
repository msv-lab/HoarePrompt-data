Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it attempts to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not correctly check whether all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.

Here are the issues:

1. **Subsequence Checking**: The program does not actually check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it tries to build a set `win` of characters that are part of the first `k` alphabets and clears it once it contains all `k` characters. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Output for "NO" Case**: When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, it prints a string that is not necessarily a valid non-subsequence. The logic for generating this string is flawed and does not guarantee that the output string is a valid non-subsequence.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**: Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Check Subsequences**: For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Output Result**: If all generated strings are subsequences, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" and provide a valid string that is not a subsequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    alphabets = [chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)]
    all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabets, repeat=n)]
    
    for string in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(s, string):
            print('NO')
            print(string)
            return
    print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**: The `product` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Check Subsequences**: The `is_subsequence` function checks if a given string `sub` is a subsequence of `s` by using an iterator and the `all` function.
3. **Output Result**: The program iterates through all generated strings and checks if any of them are not subsequences of `s`. If it finds such a string, it prints "NO" and the string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks for all possible strings and provides a valid non-subsequence if one exists.
