The only objects in the loop head are the set `us` and the variable `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `us`. If `us` has elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `us` and `us` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `us`, and `us` must still have at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is the next element of `us` and is not in `win`. Otherwise, `i` is the next element of `us` and is in `win`.**
