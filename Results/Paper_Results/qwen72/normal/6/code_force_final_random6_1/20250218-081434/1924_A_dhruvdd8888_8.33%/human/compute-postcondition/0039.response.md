To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components of the statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters.
- `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`.
- If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is the next element of `us` and is not in `win`. Otherwise, `i` is the next element of `us` and is in `win`.

### Explanation of the `print` Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

1. **`''.join(ans)`**:
   - This part of the statement converts the list `ans` into a single string by joining all its elements together without any separator.

2. **`i`**:
   - `i` is the next element of `us` that is not in `win` if `win` does not contain `i`, or the next element of `us` that is in `win` if `win` contains `i`.

3. **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**:
   - This part of the statement creates a string of `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `len(ans)` is the length of the list `ans`.

### Combining the Parts:
- The final output is a concatenation of the string formed by `ans`, the character `i`, and a string of `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume:
- `s = "abcabcabc"` (a string of length 9 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets).
- `k = 3` (the first 3 lowercase English alphabets are 'a', 'b', 'c').
- `us = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
- `n = 10`.

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Building `win` and `ans`**:
   - As `s` is processed, `win` will be filled with characters until it contains exactly `k` unique characters.
   - When `win` contains exactly `k` unique characters, the current character is added to `ans` and `win` is cleared.
   - This process repeats until `ps` is less than `n`.

2. **Assuming `ans` is built**:
   - For `s = "abcabcabc"`, `ans` might be `['a', 'b', 'c']` after the first cycle, and `ps` would be 1.
   - If `ps` is still less than `n`, the process continues, and `ans` might become `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c']` after the second cycle, and `ps` would be 2.

3. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the next element of `us` that is not in `win` or the next element of `us` that is in `win`.
   - Since `win` is cleared after each cycle, `i` will be the next element of `us` that is not in `win`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - If `ans` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c']`, then `len(ans) = 6`.
   - `i` will be the next element of `us` that is not in `win`, which could be 'a' (assuming the next cycle starts with 'a').
   - The number of 'a' characters to be added is `n - len(ans) - 1 = 10 - 6 - 1 = 3`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string formed by joining the elements of `ans`, followed by `i`, and then a string of `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.

Output: **abcabcaaa (where `ans` is the list of characters added to `win` when it contained exactly `k` unique characters, `i` is the next element of `us` that is not in `win`, and `n` is the input integer)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the structure of the `print` statement.
