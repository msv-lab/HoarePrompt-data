Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It processes the string `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters and counts how many such sequences are found. If the count of these sequences is greater than or equal to `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If the count is less than `n`, the function prints 'NO' and then, for each character in the set of the first `k` alphabets that was not part of the last sequence, it prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by the missing character, and padded with 'a' to make the string length `n`. The function does not return any value. **
