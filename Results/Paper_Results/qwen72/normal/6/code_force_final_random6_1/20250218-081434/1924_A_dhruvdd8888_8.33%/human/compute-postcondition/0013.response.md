Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the first character of `s`, and `i` is in `us`. If the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `ps` is 1. Otherwise, `win` is a set containing the first character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, and `ps` is 0.**
