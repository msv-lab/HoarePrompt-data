Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, and `ps` is 3. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, and `ps` is 3. If `i` is not in `us`, the state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remains unchanged, and `ps` is 3.**
