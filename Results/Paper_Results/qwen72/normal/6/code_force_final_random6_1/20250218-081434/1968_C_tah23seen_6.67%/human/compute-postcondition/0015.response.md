To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 500\) and each element \(x_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\).
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is now equal to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ans[1]` is now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`.
   - `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`.

3. **Evaluate the Condition for the First Iteration:**
   - For the first iteration, `i` must be 0.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `ans[1] <= arr[1]`.

4. **Check the Initial Values:**
   - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
   - `arr[1]` is an integer between 1 and 500.

5. **Determine the Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `2 * arr[0] + 1 <= arr[1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- If `arr[1]` is less than `2 * arr[0] + 1`, the loop will not execute.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `arr[1]` to be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`**.
