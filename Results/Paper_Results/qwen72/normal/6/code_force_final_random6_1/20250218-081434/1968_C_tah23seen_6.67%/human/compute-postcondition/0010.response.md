Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `4 * arr[0] + 3`, `ans[2]` now equal to `4 * arr[0] + 3`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[2]` (since `i` is 1) by adding the value of `ans[1]` to it.
- `ans[1]` is `4 * arr[0] + 3`.
- Therefore, `ans[2]` is now `4 * arr[0] + 3`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, `ans[0]`, `ans[1]`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]` still holds.
