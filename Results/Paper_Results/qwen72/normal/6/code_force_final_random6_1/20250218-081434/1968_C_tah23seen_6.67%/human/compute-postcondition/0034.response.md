Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`. `ans[-1]` is now `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
