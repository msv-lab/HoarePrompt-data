The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` adds the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, we need to consider the specific values and conditions provided.

- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`.
- `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`
   - `ans[1] = arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`
   - `ans[i + 1]` is initially 0 for all `i` where `i + 1` is within the bounds of `ans`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it.
   - For `i = 0`, `ans[1]` is updated to `ans[1] + ans[0]`.
   - Therefore, `ans[1]` becomes `2 * arr[0] + 1 + (arr[0] + 1) = 3 * arr[0] + 2`.

3. **Output State:**
   - `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ans[1]` is now `3 * arr[0] + 2`.
   - All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged, including the condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.**
