The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then calculates a value `s` based on `k` and `x` through an iterative process. After the calculation, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a result ('Yes' or 'No') has been printed based on the comparison of `a` with the calculated `s`.
