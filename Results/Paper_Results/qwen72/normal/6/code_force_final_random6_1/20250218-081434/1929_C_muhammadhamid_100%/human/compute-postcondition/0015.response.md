Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `s` is 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `s` is 1.
- The expression `s // (k - 1)` is evaluated as `1 // (k - 1)`.
- If `k` is 1, the expression `1 // (k - 1)` would result in a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code snippet.
- If `k` is greater than 1, `1 // (k - 1)` will be 0 because integer division of 1 by any positive integer greater than 1 results in 0.
- Therefore, `s` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
