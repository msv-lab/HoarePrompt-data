Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999, `t` must be greater than 2.**

The code snippet `y = x - 1` reassigns the value of `y` to `x - 1`. Since `x` is an input integer, the value of `y` is now `x - 1`, which is still an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999. The values of `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
