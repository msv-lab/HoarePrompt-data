The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the value provided by `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each of the t test cases, `i` is 1, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999, `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
