The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from user input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then calculates `y` as `x - 1` and prints the value of `y` for each test case. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the value of `x - 1` has been printed.
