Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 1, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0' and `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`, and `res` is updated to the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0', otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `res` is increased by 1.**
