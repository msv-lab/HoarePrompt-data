Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is equal to the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `i` is 0, and `hd` is greater than 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration.**

In natural language: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain the same: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is equal to the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `i` is 0, and `hd` is greater than 0.
