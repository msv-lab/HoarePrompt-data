Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`, and `res` is updated to the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1. If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', `hd` and `res` remain unchanged.***
