Output State: **The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least `t + 1` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each line from the second to the `t + 1`-th line, `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the line and converting the resulting strings to integers. The loop will have printed the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each of these lines.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the file must have enough lines to match the number of test cases specified by `t`. The loop will have processed each line from the second to the `t + 1`-th line, extracting `n` and `k` from each line, and then printing the result of the given expression for each pair of `n` and `k`.
