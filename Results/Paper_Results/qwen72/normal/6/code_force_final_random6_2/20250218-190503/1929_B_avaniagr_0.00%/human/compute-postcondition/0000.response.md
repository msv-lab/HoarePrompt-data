The only objects in the loop head are the variable `s` and the expression `[*open(0)][1:]`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to make sure that the expression `[*open(0)][1:]` yields a non-empty list. This means the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines, so that the slice `[1:]` results in at least one line.

State: **The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines, `s` is the second line of the file.**
