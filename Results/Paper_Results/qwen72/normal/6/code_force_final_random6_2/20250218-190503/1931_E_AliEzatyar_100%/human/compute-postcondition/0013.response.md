Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer a_i in `num` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `counter` is 1 if `num[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `num[i]` and `num[i + 1]`; `i` is `len(num) - 3` and `len(num)` must be greater than 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
