### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Leading Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of each string representation of the integers.
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer using the function `func_1`. This function iterates from the end of the string and counts the number of zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It then calculates the number of digits to subtract from the total by summing every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros. This is based on the idea that Anna can reverse the digits of the integers, and the trailing zeros will become leading zeros, which are removed.
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number represented as a string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Strategy:
- **Anna's Move:**
  - Anna can reverse any number in the list, which may change the number of digits in the list. However, the key point is that reversing a number does not change the total number of digits in the list, only the distribution of digits.
  - Trailing zeros in a number become leading zeros when reversed, and leading zeros are removed, effectively reducing the number of digits in that number.

- **Sasha's Move:**
  - Sasha concatenates two numbers, which increases the total number of digits in the list by the sum of the lengths of the two numbers.
  - The game ends when there is only one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number has at least `m + 1` digits.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The program's logic is based on the idea that the total number of digits in the list after Anna's optimal play (removing leading zeros) should be compared to `m + 1`.
  - If the total number of digits minus the number of digits removed by Anna is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha can always concatenate the remaining numbers to form a number with at least `m + 1` digits, thus winning the game.
  - Otherwise, Anna wins because the final number will have fewer than `m + 1` digits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for both players. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
