The loop head consists of the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop will execute if the range defined by `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)` is not empty, which means `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. This implies that `num` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at `len(num) - 1` and decrement until it reaches -1, but the loop will stop before `i` becomes -1.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer a_i in num satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `counter` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one element, and `i` must start at `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer a_i in num satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `counter` is 0; `i` is `len(num) - 1` and `len(num)` must be greater than 0**
