Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `order` is 0.** 

The variable `order` has been initialized to 0, and the other variables `a` and `num2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
