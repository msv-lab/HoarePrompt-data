Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500 and `num2` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, `order` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `order` is 2. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.***
