Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500 and `num2` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `order` is 1 if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]` and `a[2]` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`, `order` is 2 if `a[2]` is greater than or equal to `a[3]` and `a[0]` is not greater than or equal to `a[1]`, otherwise `order` is 1 if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]` and `a[2]` is not greater than or equal to `a[3]`, or `order` is 3 if neither `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]` nor `a[2]` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`.**
