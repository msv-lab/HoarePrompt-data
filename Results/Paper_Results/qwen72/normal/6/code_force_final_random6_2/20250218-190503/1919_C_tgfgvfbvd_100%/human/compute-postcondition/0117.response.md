Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest integer), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b` for each test case.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is the size of the list `l` provided for that test case.
  - `l` is the list of integers provided for that test case.
  - `x` is `n - 1`, indicating that the inner loop has completed its iteration over the list `l`.
  - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
  - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest integer).
  - `c` is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
- The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case independently and printing the value of `c` for each test case.
