Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than `x + 1`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `x + 1`, `b` is `l[x]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is assigned the value of `l[x]`.
- The value of `x` is already `x + 1` as per the initial state.
- The conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition that if `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values, remains valid.
