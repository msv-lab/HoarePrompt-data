You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the array a of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in range(n):
            if a > b:
                a, b = b, a
            if l[x] <= a:
                a = l[x]
            elif l[x] <= b:
                b = l[x]
            else:
                a = l[x]
                c += 1
        
        print(c)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest integer), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It processes each array `a` in `cases` and returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the elements of the corresponding array `a`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
