Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is the count of elements in the first `n` elements of the new `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are both set to `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
