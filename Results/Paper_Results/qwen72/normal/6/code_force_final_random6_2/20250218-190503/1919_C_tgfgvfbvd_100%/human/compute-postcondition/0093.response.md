Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `c` is 0, `a` is `l[0]`, and `b` is `float('inf')`. Additionally, `l[0]` is greater than `a` (which is now `l[0]`), and `l[0]` is greater than `b`.**
