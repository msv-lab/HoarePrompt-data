Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `x`, `a` is now equal to `l[x]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]`, where `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n` must be greater than `x` is still valid.
- The values of `a` and `b` will be swapped if `a` (after being assigned `l[x]`) is greater than `b`. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.
