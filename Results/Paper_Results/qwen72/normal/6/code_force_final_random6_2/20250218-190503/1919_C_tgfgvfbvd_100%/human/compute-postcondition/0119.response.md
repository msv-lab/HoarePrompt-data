Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an array of integers. For each test case, it identifies the smallest and second smallest integers in the array. It then counts how many integers in the array are greater than both of these values. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the printed counts for each test case. **
