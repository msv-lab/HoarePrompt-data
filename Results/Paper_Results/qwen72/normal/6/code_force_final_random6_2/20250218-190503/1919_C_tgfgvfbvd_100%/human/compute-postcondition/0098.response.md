Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 0, `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`.**

The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` have been swapped, so `a` now holds the value that `b` had before the execution, and `b` now holds the value that `a` had before the execution.
