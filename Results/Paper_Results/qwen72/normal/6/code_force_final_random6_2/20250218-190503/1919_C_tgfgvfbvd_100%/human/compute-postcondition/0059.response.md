Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 0, `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. If `a` was originally the minimum value and `b` was `float('inf')`, now `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is the minimum value. If `a` and `b` were updated based on the conditions involving `l[0]`, their new values will reflect the swap of their original values.
