Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `b` retains its original value of `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then `b` is updated to `l[0]` and `c` remains 0 if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `c` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[1]`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1. If `l[1]` ≤ `b`, `b` remains unchanged. If `l[1]` > `b`, `a` is now equal to `l[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `c` is 0. If `l[2]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `l[2]` > `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is equal to `l[2]`, and if `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
