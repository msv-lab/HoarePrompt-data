Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than `x + 1`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `x + 1`, `a` is `l[x]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is now the element at index `x` in the list `l`.
- The value of `x` has been incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `a` and `b` swap their values if `a` > `b` still holds, but the values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, so this condition remains as is.
