Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is now the last element of `lst[x]` before the `pop` operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the `pop` operation, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter, `s` is True.** 

The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. The variable `x` remains the same, and the list `lst[x]` is now one element shorter. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
