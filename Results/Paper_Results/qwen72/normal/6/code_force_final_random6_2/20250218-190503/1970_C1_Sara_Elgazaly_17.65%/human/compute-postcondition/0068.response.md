Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the `pop` operation, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter and must still have at least one element, `s` is True, `x` is now equal to `y`.** 

The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `y`, which was the last element of `lst[x]` before the `pop` operation. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If `lst[y]` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
