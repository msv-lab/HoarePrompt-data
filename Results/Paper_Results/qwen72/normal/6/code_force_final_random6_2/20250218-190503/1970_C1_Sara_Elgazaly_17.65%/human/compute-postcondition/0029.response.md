Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than or equal to 2, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` now contains one less element than before but must still contain at least one element, `s` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`.
- The value of `y` is now the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution.
- The list `lst[x]` now has one less element than it did before, but it must still contain at least one element.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
