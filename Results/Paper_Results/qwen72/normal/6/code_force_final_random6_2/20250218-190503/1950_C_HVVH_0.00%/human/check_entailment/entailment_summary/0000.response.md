Reasoning:  
The program is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, appending 'AM' or 'PM' as appropriate. However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **AM and PM Assignment**: The program incorrectly assigns 'PM' to hours that are 12 and below, which should be 'AM' except for 12:00 to 12:59, which should be 'PM' if they are in the second half of the day (i.e., from 12:00 to 23:59).

2. **Handling 12:00 to 12:59**: The program does not correctly handle the transition from 12:00 to 12:59. It should always be 'PM' for these hours, but the current logic incorrectly sets it to 'AM' for 12:00 to 12:59 in the first half of the day.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - If the hour is 00, it should be converted to 12 and marked as 'AM'.
   - If the hour is between 01 and 11, it should remain the same and be marked as 'AM'.
   - If the hour is 12, it should remain 12 and be marked as 'PM'.
   - If the hour is between 13 and 23, it should be converted to `hour - 12` and marked as 'PM'.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
