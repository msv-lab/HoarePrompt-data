Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `day` is set to 'PM'.
- The initial conditions for `n`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The logic for setting `h` and `day` based on the value of `h` is still valid, but `day` is explicitly set to 'PM' in this code snippet.
