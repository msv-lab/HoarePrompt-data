Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading a time in 24-hour format.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it correctly converts it to 12 and sets the period to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it correctly converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and sets the period to 'PM'.
   - However, there is a logical error in the else block. It incorrectly sets the period to 'PM' for hours 1 to 11, and then sets it back to 'AM' if `h` is 12. This is incorrect because hours 1 to 11 should be 'AM', and hour 12 should be 'PM'.
3. **Output Formatting**: The function correctly formats the output to ensure leading zeros are included in the hour and minute values.

To fix the logical error, the else block should be modified to set the period to 'AM' for hours 1 to 11 and 'PM' for hour 12.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h >= 12:
            if h > 12:
                h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Given the original program, the logical error in the else block means it will produce incorrect results for hours 1 to 11 and 12.

Correctness: **False**
