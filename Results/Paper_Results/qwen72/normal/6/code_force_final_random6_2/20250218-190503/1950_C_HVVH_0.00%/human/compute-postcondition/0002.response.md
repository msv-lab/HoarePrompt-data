The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `day` being 'AM' and the valid time string `s` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
