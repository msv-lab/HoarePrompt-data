Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the handling of the `day` variable and the conditions for setting `AM` and `PM`. Specifically, the conditions for setting `day` to `AM` or `PM` are incorrect. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h = h - 12
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Condition for `day`**: The `day` variable should be set based on the hour value. If the hour is 12 or greater, it should be `PM`. Otherwise, it should be `AM`.
2. **Handling Hours Greater than 12**: If the hour is greater than 12, it should be reduced by 12 to convert it to the 12-hour format.
3. **Handling Midnight (00:00)**: If the hour is 00, it should be converted to 12 and marked as `AM`.

The original program incorrectly sets `day` to `PM` for hours less than 12 and does not handle the midnight case correctly. The corrected program addresses these issues.
