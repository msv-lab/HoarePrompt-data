The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with `1 <= t <= 1440`. `s` is a string representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), where `00 <= hh <= 23` and `00 <= mm <= 59`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a string `s` representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It processes `t` test cases, each with a valid time string, and returns the processed results for each test case.**
