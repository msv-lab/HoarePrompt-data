Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the hour is between 1 and 11 (inclusive) for the AM period. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for all hours less than 12, except when the hour is 0 or 12. For example, for the input "09:41", the program will output "09:41 PM" instead of "09:41 AM". 

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `day` is set correctly for both AM and PM periods.
