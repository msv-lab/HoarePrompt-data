Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
- If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'.
- Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `h` and `m` from the input string:**
   - `h` and `m` are extracted from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'.
   - For example, if the input string is '00:30', then `h` is 0 and `m` is 30.

2. **Apply the conditions to `h` and determine `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0:
     - `h` is set to 12.
     - `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12:
     - `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
     - `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12:
     - `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise:
     - `h` remains the same.
     - `day` is set to 'PM'.

3. **Format the output:**
   - The `print` statement will format `h` and `m` to ensure they are always two digits (e.g., '01' instead of '1').
   - The output will be in the format `'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}'`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Input: '00:30'**
  - `h` is 0, `m` is 30.
  - `h` is set to 12.
  - `day` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:30 AM**

- **Input: '13:45'**
  - `h` is 13, `m` is 45.
  - `h` is updated to 13 - 12 = 1.
  - `day` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **01:45 PM**

- **Input: '12:00'**
  - `h` is 12, `m` is 00.
  - `day` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:00 AM**

- **Input: '07:15'**
  - `h` is 7, `m` is 15.
  - `h` remains 7.
  - `day` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **07:15 PM**

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the time in a 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where `h` is the hour in 12-hour format, `m` is the minute, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**
