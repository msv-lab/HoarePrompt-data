Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 3, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string. If `n` == 2, the postcondition remains as described. If `n` != 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, no changes are made to the variables. If `s.count('11') == 1`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decreased by 1, so it is now greater than 0 and has been decreased by 3 in total.
- The values of `start`, `end`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The conditions related to `n`, `count_1`, and `s.count('11')` are still valid as they were in the initial state.
