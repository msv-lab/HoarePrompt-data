Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program executes the if part, and if `s` is '00', the program executes the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the condition `count_1 % 2 != 0` is retained. If `count_1` is even, the condition `count_1 % 2 == 0` is retained, and if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is also retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.**
