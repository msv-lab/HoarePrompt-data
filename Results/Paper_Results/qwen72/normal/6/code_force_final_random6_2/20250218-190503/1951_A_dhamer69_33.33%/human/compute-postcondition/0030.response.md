The given `print` statement is:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about several variables: `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`.
- However, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
