The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers where `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end]. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are integers within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names that are integers within the range [start, end], where `start` and `end` are integers and `start` <= `end`.**
