Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying the Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`). However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the structure of the array and the conditions for making the array non-beautiful.
   - The problem requires that the array should no longer be beautiful after removing the minimum number of elements. The program's logic does not ensure this.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing `-1` because a single-element array cannot be modified to stop being beautiful.
   - However, it does not handle the case where the array consists entirely of the same element correctly. For example, in the case of `[2, 2, 2]`, the program should output `-1` because removing any element will still leave the array beautiful.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, in the case of `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs `1`, which is correct, but it does not handle more complex cases correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
2. Check if removing elements from this subarray can make the array non-beautiful.
3. If the array is already non-beautiful or if it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, output the appropriate result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest subarray of the same elements
        max_same_length = 0
        current_length = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                max_same_length = max(max_same_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1
        max_same_length = max(max_same_length, current_length)
        
        # The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest subarray of the same elements
        if max_same_length >= 3:
            print(max_same_length - 2)
        else:
            print(-1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, so we output `-1`.

2. **Find the Longest Subarray of the Same Elements**:
   - We iterate through the array to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
   - We keep track of the current length of such a subarray and update the maximum length found.

3. **Determine the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - If the longest subarray of the same elements has a length of at least 3, we can remove `max_same_length - 2` elements to make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the longest subarray of the same elements has a length of less than 3, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, so we output `-1`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem.
