Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable not shown in the function definition, typically involving a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, or both `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
