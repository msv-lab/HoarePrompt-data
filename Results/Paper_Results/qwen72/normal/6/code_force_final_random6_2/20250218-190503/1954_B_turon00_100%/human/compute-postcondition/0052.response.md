Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cnt` was either 2 or 0.
- The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets `cnt` to 0.
- `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is now 0 and `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
