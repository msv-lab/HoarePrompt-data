Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`.
   - The current value of `n` is 1, or the current value of `ans` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the constant value `-1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`, or `ans`, the `print` statement will always print `-1`.

Output: **-1**
