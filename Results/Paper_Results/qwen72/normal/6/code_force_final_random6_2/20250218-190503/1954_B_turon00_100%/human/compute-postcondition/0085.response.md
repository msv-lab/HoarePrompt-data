Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- The initial state indicates that if the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`. If this condition is not met, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
- Since the code snippet only affects `ans` and `cnt`, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- If the last element of `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` remains the same, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- If the last element of `a` does not equal `tmp`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
