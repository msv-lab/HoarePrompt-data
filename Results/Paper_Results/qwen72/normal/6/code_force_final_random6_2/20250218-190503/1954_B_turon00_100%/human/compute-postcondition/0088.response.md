Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.***
