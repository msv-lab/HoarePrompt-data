Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the list. If the list has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum number of consecutive elements. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate results have been printed. **
