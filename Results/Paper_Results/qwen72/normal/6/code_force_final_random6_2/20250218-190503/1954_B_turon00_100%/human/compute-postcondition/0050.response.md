The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is either 2 or 0, depending on the condition of `a[i-1]` being equal to `tmp`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this increment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3 if `a[i-1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is `n` if `a[i-1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.**
