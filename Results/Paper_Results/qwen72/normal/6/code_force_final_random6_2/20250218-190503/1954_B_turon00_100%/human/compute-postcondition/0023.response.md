Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
