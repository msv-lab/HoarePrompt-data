Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
- If the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
- Additionally, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `tmp`**:
   - We don't have the explicit values of the list `a` or the variable `tmp`, but we know that `i` is the last index of `a` because `i = n-1`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The code checks if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i]` or `a[n-1]`) is equal to `tmp`.
   - If it is, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - If it is not, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.

3. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`, and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - The value of `ans` is updated based on the condition described above.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: The last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`.
  - In this case, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
  - The value of `ans` is not updated because the condition does not trigger the update.

- **Scenario 2**: The last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.
  - In this case, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
  - `cnt` is set to 0.

### Conclusion:
- Since `ans` is not equal to `n` and `n` is not equal to 1, the value of `ans` is determined by the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` if the last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.
- If the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` if the last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, or it will print the unchanged value of `ans` if the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt if the last element of a is not equal to tmp, or the unchanged value of ans if the last element of a is equal to tmp)**
