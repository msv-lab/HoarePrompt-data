Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It modifies the list `row` by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing each element in the range from 1 to d-1 by 2. It then processes the list using a min-heap to update each element from index `d` to the end of the list. The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`. **
