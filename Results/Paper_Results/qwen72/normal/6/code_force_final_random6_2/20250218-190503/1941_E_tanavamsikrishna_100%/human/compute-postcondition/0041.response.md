Output State: **`i` is `d + k + 4`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed, and `row[i]` is updated to the value of the smallest element in `min_heap` (excluding elements with indices less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`) plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1, and `min_heap` now contains the tuple `e` as an additional element.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `d + k + 4`.
- The list `row` still has at least `d + k + 1` elements.
- The value of `d` remains unchanged.
- The `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed. This state remains valid.
- The value of `row[i]` is updated to the value of the smallest element in `min_heap` (excluding elements with indices less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`) plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1. This state remains valid.
- The tuple `e` is pushed into `min_heap`, so `min_heap` now contains this additional element.
