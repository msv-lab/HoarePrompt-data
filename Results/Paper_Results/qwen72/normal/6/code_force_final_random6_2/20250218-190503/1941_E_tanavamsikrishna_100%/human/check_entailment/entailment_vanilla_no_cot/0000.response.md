Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Modification of the Input Row**: In `func_1`, the first element of the row is modified to 1, which is incorrect because the first and last columns are always river banks with a depth of 0. This modification will affect the cost calculation.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost of installing a support in a cell is supposed to be `a_{i,j} + 1`, but the function `func_1` adds 2 to the cost for the first `d` elements, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

3. **Heap Management**: The heap management in `func_1` is not correctly handling the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect. The distance between supports should be `|j1 - j2| - 1`, and the heap should be managed to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

4. **Summing Costs**: The way the total cost is calculated in `func_2` is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the minimum cost for a single row, but the way it is used in `func_2` does not correctly account for the requirement to build `k` consecutive bridges.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Calculate the Minimum Cost for Each Row**: For each row, calculate the minimum cost of installing supports while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. This can be done using dynamic programming or a sliding window minimum algorithm.

2. **Sum the Costs for Consecutive Rows**: After calculating the minimum cost for each row, find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

def min_cost(row, d):
    n = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 1  # Cost of installing a support in the first cell
    min_heap = [(1, 0)]  # (cost, index)
    for j in range(1, n):
        while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < j - d:
            heappop(min_heap)
        cost = row[j] + 1 + min_heap[0][0]
        dp[j] = cost
        heappush(min_heap, (cost, j))
    return dp[-1]

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [min_cost(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        print(min(total_costs))

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`min_cost` Function**: This function calculates the minimum cost for a single row using a sliding window minimum approach with a heap. It ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **`func_2` Function**: This function reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for each row, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
