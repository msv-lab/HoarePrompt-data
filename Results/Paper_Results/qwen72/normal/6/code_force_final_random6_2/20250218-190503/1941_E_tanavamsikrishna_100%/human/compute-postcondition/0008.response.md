To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### Given State:
- `n` must be greater than `k - 1`
- `i` is 1
- `total_costs` now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`
- `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1, which means `len(costs) - (k - 1) >= 2`.
3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `len(costs) - (k - 1) >= 2` must still hold true for the loop to execute one more time. This means `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 2.
- `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 2, `total_costs` now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 2**
