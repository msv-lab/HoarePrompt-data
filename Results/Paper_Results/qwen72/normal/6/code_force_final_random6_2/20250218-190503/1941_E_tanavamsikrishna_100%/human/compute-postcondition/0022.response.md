To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `e`: This is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, which is a tuple where the first element is the value and the second element is the index.
   - `i`: This is the current index in the list `row`.
   - `d`: This is a constant that remains unchanged.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `d + k + 1`.
   - `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements.
   - `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute if the index of the element popped from `min_heap` (i.e., `e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Substituting `i` with `d + k + 1`:
     \[
     e[1] \leq (d + k + 1) - (d + 2)
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side:
     \[
     e[1] \leq k - 1
     \]

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to `k - 1`.
   - Since `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, `min_heap` must contain at least one tuple whose index is less than or equal to `k - 1`.

5. **Initial State of `min_heap`:**
   - The initial state of `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap.
   - This means that the indices in `min_heap` are from the range `[k + 1, d]`.

6. **Ensuring the Condition:**
   - To ensure that `e[1]` can be less than or equal to `k - 1`, we need to adjust the state of `min_heap` so that it contains at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k - 1`.
   - However, the problem constraints only allow us to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `min_heap`.

7. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - If we increase `i`, the right-hand side of the condition `i - (d + 2)` will also increase, making it harder for `e[1]` to satisfy the condition.
   - If we decrease `i`, the right-hand side of the condition will decrease, making it easier for `e[1]` to satisfy the condition.

8. **Adjusting `min_heap`:**
   - We need to ensure that `min_heap` contains at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints, the only way to ensure the loop executes is to adjust `i` to a value such that `i - (d + 2)` is greater than or equal to the smallest index in `min_heap`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `i` to a value such that `i - (d + 2)` is greater than or equal to the smallest index in `min_heap`. Since `min_heap` contains indices from `[k + 1, d]`, the smallest index in `min_heap` is `k + 1`.

Therefore, we need:
\[
i - (d + 2) \geq k + 1
\]
Solving for `i`:
\[
i \geq d + k + 3
\]

State: **`i` is `d + k + 3`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap.**
