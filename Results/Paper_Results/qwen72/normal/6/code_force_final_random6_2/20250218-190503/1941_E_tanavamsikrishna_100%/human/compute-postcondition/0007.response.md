Output State: **`n` must be greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `total_costs` now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of the list `costs` to the list `total_costs`. Since `i` is 1, the new element in `total_costs` is the sum of the elements from index 1 to `k` (inclusive) of `costs`. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
