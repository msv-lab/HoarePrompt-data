The function `func_2` does not take any parameters directly, but it reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where:
- `n` is the number of rows in the river grid.
- `m` is the number of columns in the river grid.
- `k` is the number of bridges to build.
- `d` is the maximum distance between supports.

It also reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells. The values are constrained such that:
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100
- 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- 1 ≤ d ≤ m
- The first and last columns have a depth of 0.

The function returns the minimum total depth of the river cells that need to be bridged to build `k` bridges, ensuring that the distance between any two supports does not exceed `d`.
