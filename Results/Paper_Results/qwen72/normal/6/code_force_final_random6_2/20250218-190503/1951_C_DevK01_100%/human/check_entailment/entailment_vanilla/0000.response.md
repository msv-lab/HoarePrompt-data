### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days**:
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets. This is correct because if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, we need an additional day to buy the remaining tickets.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to get the cheapest prices. This is a valid approach because we want to minimize the cost.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy exactly `k` tickets by purchasing `m` tickets each day for `n` days. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, where `sum(N)` is the sum of the prices of the selected days, and `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means we need to buy a different number of tickets on the last day. The program calculates the cost for the last day separately and then adds the cost for the remaining days. This is done by popping the last element `w` from `N`, calculating the number of tickets `mu` to be bought on the last day, and then adding the cost for the remaining days.

7. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - The final cost is calculated by summing up the costs for the selected days and the additional costs due to price increases.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `q`**:
  - The program calculates `q` as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, which is correct. However, the subsequent logic to handle the cost calculation is flawed.
  - The program should handle the case where `k` is not a multiple of `m` more carefully. Specifically, the cost calculation for the last day and the additional days should be more precise.

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Remaining Days**:
  - The program adds an extra term `n * m * mu` in the cost calculation, which is incorrect. This term is not needed and can lead to an overestimation of the cost.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * N[-1] + (n - 1) * mu * m
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Cost Calculation for Exact Multiples**:
  - If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which is correct.

- **Cost Calculation for Non-Exact Multiples**:
  - If `n * m != k`, the program calculates the cost for the first `n-1` days and then the cost for the last day separately.
  - `mu` is the number of tickets to be bought on the last day.
  - The cost for the first `n-1` days is `m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`.
  - The cost for the last day is `mu * N[-1] + (n - 1) * mu * m`.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues in the cost calculation for the last day and the additional days, leading to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct minimum spending.
