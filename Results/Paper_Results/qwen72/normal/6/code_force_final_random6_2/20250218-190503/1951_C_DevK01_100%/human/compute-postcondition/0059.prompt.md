You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, and 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 \le a_i \le 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t`, the loop has completed all iterations. For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` have been updated and printed according to the logic of the loop. The final `cost` for each test case has been calculated and printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of sale days `n`, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a` for each day. It returns the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
