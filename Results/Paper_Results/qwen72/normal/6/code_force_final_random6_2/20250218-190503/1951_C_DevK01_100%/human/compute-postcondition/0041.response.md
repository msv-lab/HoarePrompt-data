Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, and if `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu.**

Explanation:
- The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `M`.
- The initial state mentions that `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, so after this line of code, `M` is updated to a new sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged or are still defined based on the initial state.
