Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
