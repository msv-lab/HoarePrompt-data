To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of the list `N` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we will infer it based on the conditions).
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then:
     - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost`.
   - The value of `cost` depends on whether `n * m == k` or not.

Let's analyze both cases:

### Case 1: `n * m == k`
- `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `cost` is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{cost} = m \times \sum(N) + m^2 \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right)
  \]
  - Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`.
  - \(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\) is the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers.

### Case 2: `n * m != k`
- `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- `mu` is calculated as:
  \[
  \mu = k - (n - 1) \times m
  \]
- `cost` is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{cost} = \mu \times w + m \times \sum(N) + m^2 \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu
  \]
  - Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q-1` elements of `M`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `L`, `M`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the conditions given.

Output: **cost (where cost is the calculated cost based on the conditions provided: if \( n \times m == k \), then \( \text{cost} = m \times \sum(N) + m^2 \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) \); otherwise, \( \text{cost} = \mu \times w + m \times \sum(N) + m^2 \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu \) with \( \mu = k - (n - 1) \times m \) and \( w \) being the last element of the original `N`)**
