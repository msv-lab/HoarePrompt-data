The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves buying a specified number of tickets `k` over a series of sale days `n`, with a maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`. For each test case, the function reads the number of sale days, the maximum tickets per day, the total tickets to buy, and a list of ticket prices for each day. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy the required number of tickets, considering the constraints and the sorted ticket prices. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the minimum total cost for each test case has been printed.
