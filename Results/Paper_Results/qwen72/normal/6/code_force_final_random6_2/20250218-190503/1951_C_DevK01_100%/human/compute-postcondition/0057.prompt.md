Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m` equals `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
