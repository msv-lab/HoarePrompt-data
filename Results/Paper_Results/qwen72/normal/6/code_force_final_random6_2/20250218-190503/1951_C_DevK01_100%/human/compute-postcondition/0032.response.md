Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- `mu` is assigned the value `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- The value of `k` is `L[2]`.
- The value of `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- The value of `n` is the length of `N`.
- Therefore, `mu` is calculated as `L[2] - (len(N) - 1) * min(L[1], L[2])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
