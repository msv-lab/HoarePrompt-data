t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, and 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 \le a_i \le 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
