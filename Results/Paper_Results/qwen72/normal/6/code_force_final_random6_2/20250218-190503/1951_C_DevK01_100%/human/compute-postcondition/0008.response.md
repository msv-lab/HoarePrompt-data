Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1] and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The value of `_` remains 0.
- The list `L` remains a list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `M` remains a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- The value of `n` remains `L[0]`.
- The value of `m` remains the minimum of `L[1] and `L[2]`.
- The value of `k` remains `L[2]`.
- The value of `q` remains the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `N` is assigned the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
