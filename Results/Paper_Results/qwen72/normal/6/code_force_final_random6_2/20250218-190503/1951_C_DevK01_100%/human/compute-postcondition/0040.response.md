The code snippet `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `L`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `L` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user
- `n` is the length of the list `N`
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`
- `k` is `L[2]`
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`
- If `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `L` is now a list of integers provided by the user, replacing the previous list.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but they will be recalculated based on the new `L`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, and if `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
