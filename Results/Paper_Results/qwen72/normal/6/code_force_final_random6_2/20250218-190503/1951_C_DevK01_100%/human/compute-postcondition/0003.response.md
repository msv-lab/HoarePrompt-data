Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers input by the user.**

The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `M`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `L` remain unchanged.
