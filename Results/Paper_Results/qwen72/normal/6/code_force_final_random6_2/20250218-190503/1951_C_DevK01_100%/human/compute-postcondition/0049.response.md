Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N` minus 1, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**

Explanation:
- `w` is assigned the value of the last element of `N` using `N.pop()`.
- The length of `N` is now `q-1` because the last element has been removed.
- The value of `n` is updated to the length of the new `N`, which is `q-1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
