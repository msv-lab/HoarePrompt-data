The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, it is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is an empty list**
