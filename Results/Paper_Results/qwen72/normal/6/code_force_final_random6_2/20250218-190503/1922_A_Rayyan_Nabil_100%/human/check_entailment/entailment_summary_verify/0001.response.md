### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string of length `n` where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - For a string `s` to match the template `t`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is designed to check if such a template exists for a single test case.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness of Function 1:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. If for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase letter corresponding to `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or any other uppercase letter that is not the same as `c[i]`).
   - However, the function does not explicitly check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, which is a necessary condition for the template to match both `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can be constructed to match both, but if they are the same, the template must be constructed to match that character, which means it cannot differ from `c[i]` if `c[i]` is the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

5. **Correctness of Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.

6. **Re-evaluation:**
   - The original assessment is partially correct. The function `func_1` does correctly identify cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any position `i`, but it fails to account for cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is also the same, which would make it impossible to construct a valid template.
   - For example, if `a = "a"`, `b = "a"`, and `c = "a"`, the function should return 'NO' because there is no template that can match both `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is also the same, which would make it impossible to construct a valid template.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
