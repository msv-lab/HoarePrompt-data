### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string of length `n` where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - For a string `s` to match the template `t`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is designed to check if such a template exists for a single test case.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness of Function 1:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. If for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase letter corresponding to `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or any other uppercase letter that is not the same as `c[i]`).
   - If no such position exists, it is impossible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

5. **Correctness of Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.
