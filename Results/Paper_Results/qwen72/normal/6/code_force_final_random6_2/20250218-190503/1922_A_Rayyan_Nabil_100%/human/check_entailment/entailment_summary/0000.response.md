**Reasoning:**

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it meets the problem description for all test cases. The problem requires us to find a template `t` such that:
1. Both `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. `c` does not match the template `t`.

The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if such a template exists for a single test case. It iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if for any index `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.

However, this approach is not entirely correct. The function `func_1` only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any index `i`. This is not sufficient to ensure that `a` and `b` can both match the same template while `c` does not. We need to ensure that for each index `i`, the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are either the same or different in a way that allows a valid template to be constructed.

To be more precise, for each index `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different but `c[i]` is the same as one of them. This means that the function might incorrectly return 'YES' in cases where no valid template exists.

**Example of incorrect behavior:**
- For the input:
  ```
  3
  acc
  abd
  abc
  ```
  The function `func_1` will return 'YES' because `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`. However, there is no valid template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not. For `t[0]` to be valid, it must be 'A' (since `a[0]` is 'a' and `b[0]` is 'a'), but this would not work for `b[0]` which is 'b'. Similarly, for `t[1]` to be valid, it must be 'B' (since `a[1]` is 'c' and `b[1]` is 'b'), but this would not work for `a[1]` which is 'c'. Therefore, the correct output should be 'NO'.

**Conclusion:**
The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
