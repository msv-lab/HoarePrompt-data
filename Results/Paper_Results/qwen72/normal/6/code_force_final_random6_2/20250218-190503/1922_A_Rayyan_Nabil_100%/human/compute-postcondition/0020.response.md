Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The list `results` contains the results of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times, where `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are inputs provided by the user for each iteration, with leading and trailing whitespace removed from the string inputs. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state of `results` reflects the outcomes of `func_1` for each test case.
