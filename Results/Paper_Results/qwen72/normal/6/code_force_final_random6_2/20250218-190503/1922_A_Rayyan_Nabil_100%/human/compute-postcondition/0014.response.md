The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if the value of `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, and the loop has already run once for each element in the range of `t` up to the current value of `_`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the loop body and is incremented automatically by the `range` function, we only need to ensure that `t` remains greater than the current value of `_` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `_` will be incremented by 1.
- `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended twice, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**.
