Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The template conditions are:
- If the template has a lowercase letter at position `i`, the corresponding letters in `a` and `b` must be the same as the template.
- If the template has an uppercase letter at position `i`, the corresponding letters in `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the template letter.

The function `func_1` checks if for any position `i`, the letters in `a` and `b` are different from the letter in `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a valid template can be constructed. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the template conditions correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that the template can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. The function only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, but `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for these conditions, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
