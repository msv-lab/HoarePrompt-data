The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is controlled by the `range(t)` function. The loop can execute again if there are still iterations left within the range defined by `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `_` has just completed an iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, but since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not explicitly tracked. Instead, the loop will continue as long as the current iteration is less than `t`.

Given that the loop is defined by `range(t)`, the loop will execute `t` times in total. After the last iteration, the loop will check if the current iteration is less than `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time.

Since `_` is not tracked, the only relevant state is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
