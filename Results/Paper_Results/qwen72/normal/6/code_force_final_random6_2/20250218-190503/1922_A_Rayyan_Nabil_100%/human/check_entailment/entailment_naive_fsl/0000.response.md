Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters in the same position of strings `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in string `c`. However, it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` match the template correctly, especially when the template should have uppercase letters.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
In this case, the program will return "YES" because `a[0] != c[0]`, `a[1] != c[1]`, and `a[2] != c[2]`. However, there is no valid template that can make both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match. The correct output should be "NO".

To be correct, the program should ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must not be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and there must be a way to assign an uppercase letter to the template that satisfies the conditions.

The current implementation does not handle these conditions correctly.
