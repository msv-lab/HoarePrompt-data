Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if for any position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Ensuring that for each position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are the same.
2. Checking if there exists a position `i` where the character in `c` is different from both `a` and `b` (and also ensuring that the template can be formed with the correct case).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        else:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` constructs a template by checking if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. If they are, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it immediately returns 'NO'.
- If a valid template can be constructed, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
