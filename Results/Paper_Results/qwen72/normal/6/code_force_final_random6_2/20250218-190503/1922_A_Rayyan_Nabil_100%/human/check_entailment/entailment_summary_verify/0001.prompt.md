You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from user input, where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three additional inputs: an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, all with leading and trailing whitespace removed. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program is that `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case, and the list has been fully iterated and printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string of length `n` where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - For a string `s` to match the template `t`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is designed to check if such a template exists for a single test case.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Correctness of Function 1:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. If for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase letter corresponding to `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or any other uppercase letter that is not the same as `c[i]`).
   - If no such position exists, it is impossible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

5. **Correctness of Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
