Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, while string `c` does not. The logic in `func_1` checks if for any index `i`, the characters at `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. If no such index exists, it returns 'NO'.

However, the problem description specifies that the template `t` should have uppercase letters in positions where `a` and `b` must differ from `c`. The current implementation in `func_1` does not consider this requirement. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that the template can be constructed with uppercase letters in the required positions.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` and `b[i]` to allow an uppercase letter in the template.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then `c[i]` must not be equal to both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to allow an uppercase letter in the template.

The current implementation does not enforce these conditions, and thus, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
