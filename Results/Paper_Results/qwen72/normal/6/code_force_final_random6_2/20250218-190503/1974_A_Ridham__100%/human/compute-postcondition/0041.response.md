The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the values of `x` and `y` based on user input. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer, then assigned to `x` and `y` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99
- `n` is greater than 0
- `space_x` is equal to `x`
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`
- `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`
- `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

After the code snippet is executed:
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new values provided by the user input.
- The values of `n`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, `result`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but they will be recalculated based on the new values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to the new `x`, `space_y` is equal to the new `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to the new `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to the new `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, and `result` is a list that includes `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, otherwise `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1` otherwise, and `result` is a list containing the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
