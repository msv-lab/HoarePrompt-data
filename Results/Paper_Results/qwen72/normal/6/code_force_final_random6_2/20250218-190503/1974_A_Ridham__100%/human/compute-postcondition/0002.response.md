The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to a value for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
