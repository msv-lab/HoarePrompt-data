Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`.**

The code snippet calculates the sum of `space_x` and `space_y` and assigns it to `total_space`. The values of `x` and `y` remain within their specified ranges, and `n` is still greater than 0. The `result` list remains empty. `space_x` is still equal to `x`, and `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`. The new variable `total_space` is now equal to `x + y * 4`.
