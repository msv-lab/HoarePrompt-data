Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is determined based on whether `y` is even or odd:
  - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
  - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
- `space_y` is `y * 4`.
- The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `total_space`) remain unchanged.
