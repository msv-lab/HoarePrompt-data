Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

The value of `space_y` is updated to be four times the value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
