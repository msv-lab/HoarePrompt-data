Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`.**

The value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2`, which means it is half of `y` (since `y` is an even number, `y // 2` will be an integer). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
