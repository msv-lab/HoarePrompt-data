Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to the new `x`, `space_y` is equal to the new `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation:
- `x` and `y` are updated to the new values provided by the user input.
- `space_x` is set to the new value of `x`.
- `space_y` is set to the new value of `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is set to `x + y * 4`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
- `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.

The values of `n` and the conditions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The values of `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y`.
