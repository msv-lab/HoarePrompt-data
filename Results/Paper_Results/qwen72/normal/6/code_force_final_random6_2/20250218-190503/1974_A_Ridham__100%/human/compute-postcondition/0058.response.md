The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general return behavior.
