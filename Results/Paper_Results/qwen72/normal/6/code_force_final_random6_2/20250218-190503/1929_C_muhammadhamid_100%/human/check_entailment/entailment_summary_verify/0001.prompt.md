You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. It then calculates a value `s` starting from 1 and iteratively updates `s` using the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - Each bet `y` can either win, in which case he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins, or lose, in which case he loses `y` coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If Sasha can ensure that he will always have at least `s` coins after `x` consecutive losses, then he can always continue betting and eventually reach any number of coins `n`.
   - The value `s` is the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.

3. **Calculating `s`:**
   - After `x` consecutive losses, Sasha will have lost `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x` coins.
   - The total loss after `x` consecutive losses is the sum of the first `x` positive integers, which is given by the formula: \(\frac{x(x + 1)}{2}\).
   - To recover from these losses, Sasha must have enough coins to place a bet that will cover the total loss and still leave him with at least 1 coin.
   - The minimum number of coins `s` required to start with is the sum of the first `x` positive integers plus 1 (to ensure he can place the next bet).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 1.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time increasing `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - The idea is to simulate the minimum number of coins needed to recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - The expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the next bet amount. This is based on the assumption that after each loss, Sasha will place a bet that is just enough to recover from the previous losses and still have some coins left.

5. **Correctness of the Calculation:**
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the total loss after `x` consecutive losses.
   - The correct total loss after `x` consecutive losses is \(\frac{x(x + 1)}{2}\).
   - The program's approach of incrementing `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately reflect the required minimum starting coins to guarantee recovery.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins `s` needed to ensure Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - Therefore, the program will not always produce the correct output for all test cases.
