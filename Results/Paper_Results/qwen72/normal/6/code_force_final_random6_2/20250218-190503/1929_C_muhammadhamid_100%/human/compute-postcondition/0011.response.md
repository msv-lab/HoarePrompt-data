The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_`. According to the code, the loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, which is converted to an integer. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the loop has executed `x` times, meaning the user input must have been `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 1, and the user input must be greater than `x` for the loop to continue running for another iteration.

State: **`_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer, `s` is the value after `x` iterations of the loop, `i` is `x - 1`, the user input must be greater than `x`**
