Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, sorted in descending order.**

The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `nums` to a list of integers provided by the user, where the integers are separated by spaces in the input. The list `nums` is not explicitly sorted in the code, but the precondition states that `nums` is sorted in descending order, so this remains true. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) are not affected by this code snippet.
