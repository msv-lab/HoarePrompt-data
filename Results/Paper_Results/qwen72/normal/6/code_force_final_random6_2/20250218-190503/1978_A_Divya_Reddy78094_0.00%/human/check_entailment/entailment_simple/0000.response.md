### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list `nums` in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.
   - This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Pages:**
   - The program then prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, `nums[0] + nums[1]`.
   - This is the correct approach because the two largest elements in the list represent the books with the highest number of pages, and Alice will read one book from each pile, so the maximum pages she can read is the sum of these two largest elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `t` is between 1 and 500.
     - `n` is between 2 and 100.
     - Each `a_i` is between 1 and \(10^9\).

5. **Output:**
   - The output for each test case is the sum of the two largest elements in the list, which is the correct solution for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, sorts the list of pages in descending order, and prints the sum of the two largest elements for each test case. This approach ensures that Alice reads the maximum possible number of pages.

### Correctness:
**True**
