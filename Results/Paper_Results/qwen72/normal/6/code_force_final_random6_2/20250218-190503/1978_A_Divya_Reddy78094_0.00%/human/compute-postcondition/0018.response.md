Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, sorts the list in descending order, and prints the sum of the two largest integers in the list. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the sum of the two largest integers in the input list has been printed. **
