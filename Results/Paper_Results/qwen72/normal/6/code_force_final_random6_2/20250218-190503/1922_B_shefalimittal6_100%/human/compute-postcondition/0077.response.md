Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `v[i]` more than its previous value (which was 0), `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- The other variables (`n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
