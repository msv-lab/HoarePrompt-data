The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each inner list in `cases` contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for a test case. The constraints are: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, and `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the integers in the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains `n` integers. It returns a list of results, with each result corresponding to a test case.**
