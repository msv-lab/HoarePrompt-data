Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, and `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, so the variable `_` (which is the loop counter) will be `n - 1` after the last iteration.
- The variable `x` will be the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` after the last iteration, which is the value at the index just before the loop ends.
- The variable `idx` will be incremented by `1` for each iteration of the loop, so after `n` iterations, `idx` will be `idx + n`.
- The list `v` will have its elements at the indices corresponding to the values in `data` (from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`) incremented by 1, reflecting the count of each value encountered in the loop.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, `results`, and `t`) are not directly affected by the loop and will retain their initial values or states as described in the initial conditions.
