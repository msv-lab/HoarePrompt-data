Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `v[i]` more than its previous value (which was 0). If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i]` is less than 2, `ans` remains 0 if `v[i]` is less than 3, otherwise `ans` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.***
