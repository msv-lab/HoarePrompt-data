The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**
