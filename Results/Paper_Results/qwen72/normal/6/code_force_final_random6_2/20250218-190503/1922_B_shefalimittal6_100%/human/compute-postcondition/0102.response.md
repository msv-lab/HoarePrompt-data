Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially `idx + 2`, it is now `idx + 3`.
- The value of `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]` before `idx` was incremented, so it is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` after the increment.
- The other variables `n` and `_` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 still holds.
- The increment of `v[x]` by 1 remains valid.
