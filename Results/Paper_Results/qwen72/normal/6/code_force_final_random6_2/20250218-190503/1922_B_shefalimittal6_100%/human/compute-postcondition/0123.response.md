Postcondition: ***`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If `v[i]` is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
