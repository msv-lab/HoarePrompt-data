Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
- The value of `i` is 2, so the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` is evaluated using the count stored in `v[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
