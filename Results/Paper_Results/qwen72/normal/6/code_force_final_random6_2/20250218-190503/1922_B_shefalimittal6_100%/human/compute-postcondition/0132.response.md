Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose pairs and triplets of the same integer from the list, and appends the result as a string to a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. **
