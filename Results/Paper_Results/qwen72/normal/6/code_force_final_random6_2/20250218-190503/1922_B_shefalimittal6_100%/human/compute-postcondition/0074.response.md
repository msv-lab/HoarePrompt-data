The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0 to ensure `i` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is `v[i]` more than its previous value (which was 0), `i` is 1, `ans` is 0 if `v[i]` is less than 3, otherwise `ans` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`**
