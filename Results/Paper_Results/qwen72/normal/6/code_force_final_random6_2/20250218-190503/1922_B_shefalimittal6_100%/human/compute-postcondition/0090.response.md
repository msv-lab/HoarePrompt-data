Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n` + 1, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `results` includes an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `idx` is `idx` + 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
