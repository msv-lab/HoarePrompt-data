Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `v[x]` is 3, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, so `v[x]` changes from 2 to 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
