Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to it. This expression calculates the number of combinations of `v[i]` taken 3 at a time, which is only added to `ans` if `v[i]` is at least 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
