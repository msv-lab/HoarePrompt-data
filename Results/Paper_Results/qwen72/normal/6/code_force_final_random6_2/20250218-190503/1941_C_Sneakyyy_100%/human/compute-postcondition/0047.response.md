Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` assigns the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` to the variable `s`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 2, so `s` is the substring of `a` from index 2 to index 4.
- The initial state also specifies that `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 if the substring `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie' and the substring starting at `i-1` and ending at `i + 2` is also not 'map' or 'pie'.
- Since the code only assigns the value to `s` and does not change `ans` or `i`, the values of `ans` and `i` remain as specified in the initial state.
- The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.
