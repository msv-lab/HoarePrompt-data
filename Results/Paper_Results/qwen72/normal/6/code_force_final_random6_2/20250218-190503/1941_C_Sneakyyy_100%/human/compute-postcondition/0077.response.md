Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7, and `len(a)` must be greater than 8. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3, and `len(a)` must be greater than 4. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie' but `len(a)` is not greater than 5, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6.**
