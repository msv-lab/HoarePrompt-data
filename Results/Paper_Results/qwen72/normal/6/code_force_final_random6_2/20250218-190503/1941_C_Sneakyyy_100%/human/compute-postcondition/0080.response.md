To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3.
   - `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is the index of the last character checked in `a` plus 1, which is `len(a) - 2` or greater.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated by counting the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
   - Non-overlapping means that once a substring is found, the search continues from the character after the end of the found substring.

3. **Understanding `i`:**
   - `i` is the index of the last character checked in `a` plus 1.
   - Since `i` is `len(a) - 2` or greater, it indicates that the search for substrings has been completed up to the second-to-last character of `a` or further.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`)**
