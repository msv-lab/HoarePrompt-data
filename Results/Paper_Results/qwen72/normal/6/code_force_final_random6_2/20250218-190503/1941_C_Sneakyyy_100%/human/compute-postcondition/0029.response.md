Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the new `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 2` or greater.**

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is `len(a) - 2` or greater. After executing the code `a = input()`, the value of `a` is updated to a new input string. The number of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the new `a` is now stored in `ans`, and `i` is still `len(a) - 2` or greater. The values of `int(input())` and `n` remain unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
