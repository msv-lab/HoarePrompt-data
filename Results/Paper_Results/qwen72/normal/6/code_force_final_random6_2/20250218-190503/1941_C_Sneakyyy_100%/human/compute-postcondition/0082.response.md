The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `s` is a list of strings, where each string `s[i]` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `s`. The exact nature of the results is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each string in `s` and returns some form of output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s`, and returns a list of results, each corresponding to a processed test case from `s`.**
