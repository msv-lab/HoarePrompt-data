Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s where each string s[i] has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the provided function definition is missing the parameters. It should be updated to:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```
Where `test_cases` is a list of strings, each representing a test case.
