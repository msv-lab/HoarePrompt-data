Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a` if `i` was 1, otherwise `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 4. `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 3.
- If `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `i` was 3, so after incrementing, `i` is now 6.
- If `s` was not 'map' or 'pie', `i` was 1, so after incrementing, `i` is now 4.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
