Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `output1` is a list containing [1], `output2` is a list containing [x], and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

The value of `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `i` is 1. The list `output1` remains unchanged and still contains [1]. The list `output2` now contains the integer value of `x` divided by `i`, which is `x` itself since `i` is 1. `x` is still divisible by `i`, so `x % i == 0` remains true.
