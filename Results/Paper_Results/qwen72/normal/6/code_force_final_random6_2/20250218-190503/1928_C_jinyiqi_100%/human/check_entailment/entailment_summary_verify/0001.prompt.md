You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted in descending order. The divisors are first collected into two lists: `output2` contains divisors greater than the square root of `x`, and `output1` contains divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The final list is formed by concatenating `output2` with the reversed `output1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern in which students are assigned numbers in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given position \(n\) and number \(x\), we need to determine how many different values of \(k\) fit the constraints.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern for the first \(k\) positions is \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The pattern for the next \(k - 2\) positions is \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - This pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.

3. **Constraints:**
   - \(k > 1\)
   - \(1 \le x < n \le 10^9\)

4. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), \(k\) must be such that \(n\) falls into one of the repeating segments.
   - The position \(n\) can be either in the increasing segment or the decreasing segment.
   - The increasing segment starts at position 1 and ends at position \(k\).
   - The decreasing segment starts at position \(k + 1\) and ends at position \(2k - 2\).

5. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If \(n\) is in the increasing segment, then \(n \mod (2k - 2) \le k\).
   - If \(n\) is in the decreasing segment, then \(n \mod (2k - 2) > k\) and \(n \mod (2k - 2) \le 2k - 2\).

6. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number.
   - It then checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \(k\).

7. **Program Breakdown:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

   - **Divisor Calculation:**
     - `func_1` calculates all divisors of a given number \(x\).
     - It returns a list of divisors.

   - **Condition Checking:**
     - The program checks if \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\).
     - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective number and checks if they fit the constraints for \(k\).

   - **Output:**
     - The program collects all valid \(k\) values, removes duplicates, and prints the count.

8. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Divisor Calculation:**
     - `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number.
   - **Condition Checking:**
     - The conditions \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\) are necessary to ensure that \(n\) and \(x\) fit into the pattern.
   - **Valid \(k\) Calculation:**
     - The program correctly checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \(k\) by ensuring \((s + 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((s + 2) / 2 \ge x\).

9. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where \(k = 1\) is not valid.
   - It also handles the constraints \(1 \le x < n \le 10^9\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid \(k\) values based on the given constraints. The divisor calculation and condition checking are appropriate for the problem.
