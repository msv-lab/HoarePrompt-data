The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is valid, which means `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1. This is true for any `x` greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the condition `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`.

For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 1, and `x` should be within the given range. The outputs `output1` and `output2` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list**
