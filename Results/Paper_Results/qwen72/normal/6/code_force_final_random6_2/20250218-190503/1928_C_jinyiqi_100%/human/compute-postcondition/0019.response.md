Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted in descending order. The divisors are first collected into two lists: `output2` contains divisors greater than the square root of `x`, and `output1` contains divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The final list is formed by concatenating `output2` with the reversed `output1`. **
