### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to construct the tree from the input edges.
   - The `add_edge` method adds edges to the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a specified vertex (0 in this case) and calculates the subtree sizes for each vertex. This is done using a non-recursive depth-first search (DFS) to avoid stack overflow issues with large trees.

2. **Component Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function performs a DFS to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex `s` with a threshold `x`. It modifies the tree by updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex.
   - The `func_2` function is similar to `func_1` but does not modify the tree and instead returns the number of good components and the remaining size directly.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum x:**
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. It uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`. This ensures that the maximum number of vertices in each remaining component is found.

4. **Main Function:**
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x` for each test case.

### Analysis of Functionality:

- **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
  - The tree is correctly constructed and rooted, ensuring that the subtree sizes are calculated accurately.

- **Component Calculation:**
  - `func_1` and `func_2` both correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree. The difference is that `func_1` modifies the tree, while `func_2` does not. Both functions are used appropriately in the context of the problem.

- **Binary Search:**
  - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum `x` efficiently. The binary search range is from 1 to `n`, and it correctly narrows down the range based on the results of `func_3`.

- **Main Function:**
  - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x` for each test case. The output is printed correctly.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Input and Output:**
  - The input is read correctly, and the output is printed as required by the problem statement.
  - The tree is constructed and rooted correctly, ensuring that the subtree sizes are calculated accurately.

- **Component Calculation:**
  - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree, which is essential for determining the maximum `x`.

- **Binary Search:**
  - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently and correctly.

- **Test Cases:**
  - The provided test cases are handled correctly, and the output matches the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality to solve the problem as described. It constructs the tree, roots it, calculates the number of good components and remaining sizes, and uses binary search to find the maximum `x` for each test case.
