Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has at least three children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `u` is the third child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.** 

In natural language: The `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` in the tree has been updated to include the `good_components` of its third child `u`. All other variables and the structure of the tree remain unchanged.
