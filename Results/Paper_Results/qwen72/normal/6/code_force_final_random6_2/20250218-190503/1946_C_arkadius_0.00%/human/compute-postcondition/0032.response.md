Postcondition: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, and `postorder` is a boolean. If `postorder` is `True`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has processed all its children, `stack` is an empty list, and for each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of vertex `v` (where `v` is equal to `s`), and `postorder` remains `False`.**
