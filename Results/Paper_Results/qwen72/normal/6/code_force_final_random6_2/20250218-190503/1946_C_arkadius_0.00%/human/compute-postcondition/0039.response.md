Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended to it twice, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
