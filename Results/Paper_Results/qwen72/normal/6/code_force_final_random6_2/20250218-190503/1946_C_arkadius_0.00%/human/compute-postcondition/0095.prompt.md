Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, and `postorder` is a boolean. If `postorder` is `True`, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has processed all its children, `stack` is an empty list, and for each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of vertex `v` (where `v` is equal to `s`), and `postorder` remains `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to the sum of its original value and the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, plus the `good_components` of all other children, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its original value and the `remaining_size` of all children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is False, `stack` has the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended to it for each child `u` of `v`, and all children of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` have been processed by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple. If `postorder` is not empty, `v` has had all its children processed, and the `good_components` value of `v` is the sum of the `good_components` of all its children, plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` of `v` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is empty, all the children of the current `v` are appended to `stack` in the form `(u, False)`, and the tuple `(v, True)` is appended to `stack` for each vertex `v` that was processed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
