The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tree.vertices[v].children`. If this list has at least one child, the loop will execute. The state of `u` will be the first child in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is True, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`**
