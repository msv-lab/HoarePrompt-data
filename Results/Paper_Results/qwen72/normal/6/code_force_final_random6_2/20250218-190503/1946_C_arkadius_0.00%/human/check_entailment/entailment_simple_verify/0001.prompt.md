You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices and need to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `x`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of several functions:
     - `func_1`: A non-recursive function to traverse the tree and count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_2`: A recursive function to traverse the tree and count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_3`: A function to check if a given `x` is a valid solution.
     - `func_4`: A binary search function to find the maximum `x`.
     - `func_5`: The main function to read input and call the other functions.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function uses a stack to perform a depth-first traversal of the tree.
     - It counts the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
     - The function is designed to handle the tree traversal in a non-recursive manner, which is useful for large trees to avoid stack overflow.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function is a recursive version of the tree traversal.
     - It counts the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
     - The function is used to verify the correctness of the non-recursive approach in `func_1`.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function checks if a given `x` is a valid solution by calling `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n` and iteratively narrows down the range until it finds the maximum valid `x`.

   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
     - It handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each one.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed using the provided edges.
   - The output is printed for each test case as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0 (no edges are removed) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the tree is a single vertex (n = 1) correctly.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is an efficient approach for this problem.
   - The tree traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly count the good components and remaining sizes.
   - The validation function (`func_3`) correctly checks if the given `x` is a valid solution.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and follows the correct approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and uses efficient algorithms to find the maximum `x`.

Correctness: **True**
