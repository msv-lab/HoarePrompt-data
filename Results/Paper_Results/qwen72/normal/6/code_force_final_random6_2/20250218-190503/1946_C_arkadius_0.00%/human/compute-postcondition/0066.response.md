Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to `stack`.**
