### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize `x`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program is structured with several functions:
     - `func_1`: A non-recursive function to traverse the tree and count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_2`: A recursive function to traverse the tree and count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_3`: A function to check if a given `x` is a valid solution.
     - `func_4`: A binary search function to find the maximum `x`.
     - `func_5`: The main function to read input and call the other functions.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function uses a stack to perform a depth-first traversal of the tree.
     - It correctly counts the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
     - The function is designed to handle the tree traversal in a non-recursive manner, which is useful for large trees to avoid stack overflow.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function is a recursive version of the tree traversal.
     - It correctly counts the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
     - The function is used to verify the correctness of the non-recursive approach in `func_1`.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function checks if a given `x` is a valid solution by calling `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct for determining if `x` is a valid solution.

   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n` and iteratively narrows down the range until it finds the maximum valid `x`.
     - The binary search approach is efficient and appropriate for this problem.

   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
     - It handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each one.
     - However, the function summary provided for `func_5` is incorrect. It states that the function prints the number of nodes that are at a distance `k` from the root node, which is not what the function does. The function actually prints the maximum `x` such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices after removing `k` edges.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed using the provided edges.
   - The output is printed for each test case as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0 (no edges are removed) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the tree is a single vertex (n = 1) correctly.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is an efficient approach for this problem.
   - The tree traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly count the good components and remaining sizes.
   - The validation function (`func_3`) correctly checks if the given `x` is a valid solution.
   - The main function (`func_5`) correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is logically sound and follows the correct approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and uses efficient algorithms to find the maximum `x`.

Final: **True**
