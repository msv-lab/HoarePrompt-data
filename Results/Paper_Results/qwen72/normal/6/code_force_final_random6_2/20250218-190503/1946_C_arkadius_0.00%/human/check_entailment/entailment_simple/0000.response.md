### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to construct the tree from the input edges.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a specified vertex, ensuring that each vertex has a parent and a list of children. This is done using a non-recursive stack-based approach to avoid stack overflow issues with large trees.

2. **Good Components Calculation:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges.
   - `func_1` uses a stack-based approach to traverse the tree in a post-order manner, updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that does the same calculation. However, it is not used in the main program, and `func_1` is the one that is actually called.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size:**
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`.
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the condition in `func_3`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum component size.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The main block reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_5`.
   - Each test case is handled independently, and the results are printed for each case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Tree Construction:**
  - The tree is constructed correctly using the `add_edge` method.
  - The tree is rooted correctly using the `root_tree_non_recursive` method.

- **Good Components Calculation:**
  - `func_1` correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
  - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated correctly for each vertex.

- **Binary Search:**
  - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining component has a size of at least `x`.
  - The binary search is implemented correctly, and the condition in `func_3` ensures that the search is valid.

- **Main Function:**
  - `func_5` correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find and print the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It constructs the tree, roots it, calculates the good components and remaining sizes, and uses binary search to find the maximum component size. The input and output handling is also correct.

### Correctness: **True**
