Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a non-negative integer `x`. It returns a tuple containing two values: the total number of good components found in the subtrees of `v` plus the number of subtrees with a size of at least `x`, and the sum of the sizes of all subtrees with a size less than `x` plus 1. The function does not modify the input `tree` or the parameters `v` and `x`. **
