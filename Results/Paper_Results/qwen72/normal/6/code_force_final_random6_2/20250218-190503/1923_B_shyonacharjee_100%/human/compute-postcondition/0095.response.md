The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4).
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the lists `a` and `x` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- `x` is a list of `n` integers where the integers are strictly increasing and within the range (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n; x_i ≠ 0).

The function returns different outputs based on the input parameters, but the specific output conditions are not provided. Therefore, the general functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the given parameters and return a result based on the constraints and relationships between `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`, and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships between these parameters.**
