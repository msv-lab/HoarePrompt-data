t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of monsters and the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster. x is a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
