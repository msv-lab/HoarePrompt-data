Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the loop completes without breaking due to the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user. After executing the code, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, `can_survive`) remain unchanged and retain their initial state values.
