Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `steps` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), and `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations that have been executed.
- The variable `steps` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has just finished its last iteration.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will hold the last set of coordinates provided by the user input during the final iteration.
- The variables `n` and `x` will be the last computed values of the squared distances between the points (a, b) and (e, f), and (c, d) and (g, h), respectively.
- The condition `x > n` will determine which value is printed during the last iteration. If `x` is greater than `n`, the value of `n` will be printed; otherwise, the value of `x` will be printed.
