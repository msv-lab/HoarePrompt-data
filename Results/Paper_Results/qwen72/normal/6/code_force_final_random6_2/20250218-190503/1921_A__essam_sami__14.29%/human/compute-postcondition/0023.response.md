The only objects in the loop head are variables `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `steps` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `steps` is increased by 1, so `steps` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `c` and `d` are new integers provided by the user input, `e` and `f` are new integers provided by the user input, `g` and `h` are new integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
