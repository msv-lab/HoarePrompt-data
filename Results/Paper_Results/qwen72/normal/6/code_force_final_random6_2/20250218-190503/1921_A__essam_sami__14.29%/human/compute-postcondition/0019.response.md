Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `c` and `d` are new integers provided by the user input, `e` and `f` are new integers provided by the user input, `g` and `h` are new integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
