Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from user input, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of two squares. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between the first pair of coordinates and the third pair, and the squared distance between the second pair and the fourth pair. It then compares these two squared distances and prints the smaller one. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t`, the iteration count `steps`, and the last set of coordinates and distances calculated, but these are not accessible outside the function. **
