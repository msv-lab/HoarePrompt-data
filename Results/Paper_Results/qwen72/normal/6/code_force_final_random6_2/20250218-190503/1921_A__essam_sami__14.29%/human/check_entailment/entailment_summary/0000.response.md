Reasoning:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the area of the square. The problem requires finding the area of a square given its four corners in random order. The program, however, calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of these two values. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Side Length**: The side length of the square should be the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent corners. The program calculates the squared distance between non-adjacent points, which is not a valid way to find the side length of the square.

2. **Assumption of Adjacent Points**: The program assumes that the first and third points, and the second and fourth points, are adjacent. This assumption is not valid because the points are given in random order.

3. **Correct Approach**: To find the area of the square, we need to:
   - Identify the side length of the square.
   - The side length can be found by taking the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length will be the same for all pairs of adjacent corners.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points to ensure they are in a consistent order
        points.sort()
        
        # The side length of the square can be found by the difference in x-coordinates
        # of the first two points or the difference in y-coordinates of the first and third points
        side_length = max(abs(points[1][0] - points[0][0]), abs(points[2][1] - points[0][1]))
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length * side_length
        
        print(area)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version:
- Collects all four points and sorts them to ensure a consistent order.
- Calculates the side length of the square by taking the maximum of the absolute differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two points and the first and third points, respectively.
- Computes the area by squaring the side length and prints it.

Given the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
