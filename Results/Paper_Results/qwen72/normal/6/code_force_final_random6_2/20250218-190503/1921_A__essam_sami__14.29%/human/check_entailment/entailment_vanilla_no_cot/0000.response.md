Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The program calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two pairs of points, but this approach is not guaranteed to find the side length of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two points in the x or y direction. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_square_area():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points by x-coordinate
        points.sort()
        
        # The side length of the square can be found by the difference in x or y coordinates
        # of the first two points (since they are adjacent and the square is aligned with the axes)
        side_length = min(points[1][0] - points[0][0], points[3][1] - points[0][1])
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

find_square_area()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads the coordinates of the four corners for each test case.
2. **Sorting Points**: The points are sorted by their x-coordinates. This ensures that the first two points in the sorted list are adjacent in the x-direction.
3. **Finding Side Length**: The side length of the square is determined by the minimum difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the adjacent points.
4. **Calculating Area**: The area of the square is calculated as the side length squared and printed.

This approach ensures that the side length is correctly identified and the area is calculated accurately for each test case.
