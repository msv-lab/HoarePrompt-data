The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `q` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `q` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.**
