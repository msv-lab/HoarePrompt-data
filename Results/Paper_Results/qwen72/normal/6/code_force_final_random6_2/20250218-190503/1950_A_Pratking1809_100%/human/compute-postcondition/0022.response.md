To determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
- `q` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`.
- If `a < b < c` is not true, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b < c`.
- If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.
- If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('PEAK')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
