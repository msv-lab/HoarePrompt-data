Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `q` which is the number of test cases. It ensures that `q` is within the range 1 to 1000, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. The input is split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE".
4. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions checked. The output format matches the problem description.

The program does not return any value, which is appropriate since the task is to print the results directly.

Given the above points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
