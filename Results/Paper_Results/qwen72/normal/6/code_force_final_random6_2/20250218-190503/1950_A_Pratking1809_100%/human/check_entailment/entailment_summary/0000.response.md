Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description and the execution summary. It reads the number of test cases, `q`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`), and prints the appropriate output based on these conditions. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. The program handles all the cases as described in the problem and the example, and it does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
