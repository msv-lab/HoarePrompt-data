The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate test cases where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these test cases.

Since the specific output is not provided, we can only infer that the function likely returns some form of result or evaluation based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function generates or uses test cases with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and for each test case, integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It returns a result based on these test cases.**
