Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. If `a < b < c` is not true, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.***
