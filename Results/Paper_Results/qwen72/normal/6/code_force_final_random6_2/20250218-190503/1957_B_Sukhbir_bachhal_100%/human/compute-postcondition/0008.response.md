Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is not equal to 0, `position` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer. Since `n` was initially an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), after the right shift, `n` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50000\). The other variables `k`, `n` not being 0, and `position` remain unchanged.
