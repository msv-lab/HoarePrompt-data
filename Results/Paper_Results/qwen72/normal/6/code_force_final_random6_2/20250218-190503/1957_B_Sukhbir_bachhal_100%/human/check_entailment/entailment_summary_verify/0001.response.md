### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Single Element Case (n == 1):**
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k` because the sequence must contain exactly one element, and that element must be `k` to satisfy the sum condition.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Multiple Elements Case (n > 1):**
   - The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position that is set in `k`.
   - The function `func_1` works by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts, which corresponds to the highest bit position.
   - The program then constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position determined by `func_1`.
     - It appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - It appends `0` for the remaining `n - 2` elements to ensure the sequence has `n` elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the sequence is `k` because the first element is `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, and the remaining elements are `0`.
  - This satisfies the condition \(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k\).

- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
  - The value `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
  - The bitwise OR of `2 ** counter - 1` and any other number will have at least as many 1s as `2 ** counter - 1`.
  - By choosing `2 ** counter - 1` as the first element and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` as the second element, we ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible.
  - The remaining elements are `0`, which do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function `func_1` is correctly described. It returns the highest bit position that is set in `n` minus one.
- The function works as intended by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0 and counting the shifts.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1: \( n = 1 \)**
  - The program correctly prints `k` when `n` is 1.
- **Case 2: \( n > 1 \) and \( k \) is a power of 2**
  - If `k` is a power of 2, `2 ** counter - 1` will be a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k` minus one. For example, if `k = 8` (which is \(2^3\)), `2 ** 3 - 1 = 7` (which is \(111_2\)).
  - The second element will be `k - 7`, which is 1 in this case.
  - The sequence will be `[7, 1, 0, 0, ...]` for `n > 2`, and the bitwise OR will be `7 | 1 = 7`, which has 3 ones in its binary representation.
- **Case 3: \( n > 1 \) and \( k \) is not a power of 2**
  - The program will still correctly construct the sequence with the first element being `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element being `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`.
  - The bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies both conditions: the sum of the sequence is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
