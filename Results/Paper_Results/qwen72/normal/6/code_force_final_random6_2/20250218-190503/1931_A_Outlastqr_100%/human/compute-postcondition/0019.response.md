Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided only assigns a new value to `n` based on the user input. Since `n` is now an input integer, its value is not known until the input is provided. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `word`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
