Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.**

Explanation: The variable `word` is updated by concatenating 'a', the character at the index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and 'z'. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged. The value of `word` is now a string that starts with 'a', followed by the character from `alphabet` at the index `n - 28`, and ends with 'z'.
