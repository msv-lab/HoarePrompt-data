Reasoning:  
The program is designed to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The logic is broken down into different cases based on the value of `n`:

1. **If `n > 52`:**
   - The program assumes the word is in the form of `Xzz`, where `X` is a character that, when added to the positions of 'z' (26) and 'z' (26), equals `n`.
   - The character `X` is found by subtracting 52 (26 + 26) from `n` and then using the result as an index in the alphabet string. This is correct because the smallest possible value for `n` in this case is 53 (corresponding to 'azz'), and the largest is 78 (corresponding to 'zzz').

2. **If `n > 27` and `n <= 52`:**
   - The program assumes the word is in the form of `aXz`, where `X` is a character that, when added to the positions of 'a' (1) and 'z' (26), equals `n`.
   - The character `X` is found by subtracting 27 (1 + 26) from `n` and then using the result as an index in the alphabet string. This is correct because the smallest possible value for `n` in this case is 28 (corresponding to 'aaz'), and the largest is 52 (corresponding to 'azz').

3. **If `n == 27`:**
   - The program directly sets the word to 'aay'. This is correct because the only way to get a sum of 27 with three letters is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).

4. **If `n < 27`:**
   - The program assumes the word is in the form of `aaX`, where `X` is a character that, when added to the positions of 'a' (1) and 'a' (1), equals `n`.
   - The character `X` is found by subtracting 2 (1 + 1) from `n` and then using the result as an index in the alphabet string. This is correct because the smallest possible value for `n` in this case is 3 (corresponding to 'aaa'), and the largest is 26 (corresponding to 'aaz').

The program correctly handles all the specified cases and outputs the lexicographically smallest word for each `n` within the given constraints. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
