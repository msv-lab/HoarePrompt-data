To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, we need to evaluate the value of `word` based on the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the `word` calculation).
- `i` is 2 (not directly relevant to the `word` calculation).
- `n` is an input integer.

### Conditions for `word`:
1. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
3. If `n` == 27, `word` is the string 'aay'.
4. If `n` < 27, `word` is the string 'aa' followed by the character at the index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **If `n` > 52:**
   - `word` will be `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English alphabet: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
   - For example, if `n` = 54, then `word` = `alphabet[54 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[1] + 'zz'` = 'bzz'.

2. **If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52:**
   - `word` will be 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
   - For example, if `n` = 30, then `word` = 'a' + `alphabet[30 - 28]` + 'z' = 'a' + `alphabet[2]` + 'z' = 'acz'.

3. **If `n` == 27:**
   - `word` will be 'aay'.
   - For example, if `n` = 27, then `word` = 'aay'.

4. **If `n` < 27:**
   - `word` will be 'aa' followed by the character at the index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.
   - For example, if `n` = 10, then `word` = 'aa' + `alphabet[10 - 3]` = 'aa' + `alphabet[7]` = 'aa' + 'h' = 'aah'.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we need to describe the output based on the conditions:

- If `n` > 52, the output will be `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, the output will be 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
- If `n` == 27, the output will be 'aay'.
- If `n` < 27, the output will be 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the conditions based on the value of n)**

To provide a more precise and human-readable description:
- If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.
- If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'z'.
- If `n` == 27, `word` is 'aay'.
- If `n` < 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the conditions based on the value of n)**

For a specific value of `n`, you can substitute it into the conditions to get the exact output. For example:
- If `n` = 55, the output will be 'cz'.
- If `n` = 35, the output will be 'az'.
- If `n` = 27, the output will be 'aay'.
- If `n` = 10, the output will be 'aah'.
