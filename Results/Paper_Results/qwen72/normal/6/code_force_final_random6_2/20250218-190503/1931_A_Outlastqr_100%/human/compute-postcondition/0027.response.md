Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the string corresponding to the character at index `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. If `n` > 27 but `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` < 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.***
