Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 0.
2. `t` is greater than 0.
3. `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
4. `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
5. `k` is 0.
6. `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
7. `i` is the last element of `arr`.
8. `arr` contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.
9. `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks.
10. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`.
11. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input List `l1`**:
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input. For example, `l1 = ['5', '21']`.

2. **Extracting `n` and `k0`**:
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`. In the example, `n = 5`.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. In the example, `k0 = 21`.

3. **Binary Representation of `k0`**:
   - The binary representation of `k0` is `10101` (since 21 in binary is `10101`).
   - `arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. In this case, `arr = [0, 2, 4]` (the indices of the 1s in `10101`).

4. **Building the `ans` List**:
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
   - For each `i` in `arr`, `1 << i` is added to `ans` until `c` (the number of elements in `ans`) reaches `n - 1`.
   - In the example:
     - `1 << 0` is `1`, so `ans = [1]`.
     - `1 << 2` is `4`, so `ans = [1, 4]`.
     - `1 << 4` is `16`, so `ans = [1, 4, 16]`.
     - Now, `c = 3` and `n - 1 = 4`, so we need one more element.
     - The last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans) = 21 - (1 + 4 + 16) = 21 - 21 = 0`.
     - Therefore, `ans = [1, 4, 16, 0]`.

5. **Padding `ans` to Length `n`**:
   - `ans` is padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.
   - In the example, `ans` already has 4 elements, so we need to add one more zero to make it 5 elements long.
   - Therefore, `ans = [1, 4, 16, 0, 0]`.

6. **Printing `ans`**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 4 16 0 0** (where `ans` is the list of values derived from the binary representation of `k0` and padded to length `n`).

This output is based on the given initial state and the steps described in the code snippet.
