Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `arr` contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` updates the values of `n` and `k` to the integer values of the first and second elements in `l1`, respectively.
- The initial value of `n` (which was the integer value of the first element in `l1`) is now explicitly assigned to `n`.
- The initial value of `k0` (which was the integer value of the second element in `l1`) is now explicitly assigned to both `k` and `k0`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
