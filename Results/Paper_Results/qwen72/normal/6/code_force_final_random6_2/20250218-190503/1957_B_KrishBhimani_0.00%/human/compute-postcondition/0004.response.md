Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except that a new variable `k0` has been assigned the same value as `k`, which is the integer value of the second element in the list `l1`.
