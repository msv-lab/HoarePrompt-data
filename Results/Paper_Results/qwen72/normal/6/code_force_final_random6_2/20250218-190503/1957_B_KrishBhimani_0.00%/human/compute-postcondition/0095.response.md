Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`).**

Explanation:
- The code `l1 = input().split()` updates the value of `l1` to a list of strings obtained from the input.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- `n` is still the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k0` is still the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- The length of `ans` is still `n` elements, with the initial values [2, 2, 1] followed by `n - len(ans)` zeros.
