The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1, and `arr` is [0, 1]. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next element in `arr`.

Since `arr` is [0, 1], the next element after 1 is 0 (as the loop will start over from the beginning of the list). However, in a typical for loop, the variable `i` is not manually adjusted; instead, it takes the next value from the list `arr` automatically. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 0.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is [2, 2]**
