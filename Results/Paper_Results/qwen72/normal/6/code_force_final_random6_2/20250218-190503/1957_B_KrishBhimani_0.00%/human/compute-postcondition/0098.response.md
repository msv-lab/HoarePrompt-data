Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [], `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`).**

Explanation:
- The code `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`.
- Since `k` is already the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` now holds the same value.
- All other variables remain unchanged, so their initial states are still valid.
