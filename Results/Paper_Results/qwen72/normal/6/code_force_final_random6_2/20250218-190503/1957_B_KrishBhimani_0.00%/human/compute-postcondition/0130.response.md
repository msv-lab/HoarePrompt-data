Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` also contains the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
