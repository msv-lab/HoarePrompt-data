Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (and rounded down if necessary) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2, `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`), `arr` is [1, 2] if `k` was odd before the operation, otherwise `arr` is [2].**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `arr`. If `k` was odd before the operation, `arr` was initially [1], so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes [1, 2]. If `k` was even, `arr` was initially an empty list, so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes [2]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
