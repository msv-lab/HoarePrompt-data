Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is [2, 2, `k0` - 4]** 

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is [2, 2], so `sum(ans)` is 2 + 2 = 4.
- The value `k0 - 4` is appended to `ans`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
