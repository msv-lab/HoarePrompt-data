Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is `k0 // 2`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2. If `k` is an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
