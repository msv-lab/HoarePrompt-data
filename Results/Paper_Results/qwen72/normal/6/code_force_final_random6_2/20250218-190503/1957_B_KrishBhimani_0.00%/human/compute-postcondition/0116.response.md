Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, c is 3, ans is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is n - len(ans)), and arr is a list of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of k0, starting from 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The list `l1` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The variable `k` is 0 after the loop has finished executing, because the loop continues to divide `k` by 2 (using bitwise right shift) until `k` becomes 0.
- The variable `k0` remains the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- The variable `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`. This is because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop runs until `k` becomes 0, which happens after `i` has been incremented for each bit in `k0`.
- The variable `c` remains 3.
- The list `ans` remains unchanged, still being [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] with the number of zeros appended being `n - len(ans)`.
- The list `arr` contains the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from 0. For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary 1101), `arr` will be [0, 2, 3] because the 1s are at positions 0, 2, and 3 in the binary representation.
