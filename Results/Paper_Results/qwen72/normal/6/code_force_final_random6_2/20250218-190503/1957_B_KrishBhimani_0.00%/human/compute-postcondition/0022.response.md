Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0` (i.e., the number of times the loop executed), `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero.
- Each iteration checks if the least significant bit of `k` is 1 (i.e., `k & 1 == 1`). If it is, the current value of `i` is appended to the list `arr`.
- `k` is then right-shifted by 1 bit (i.e., `k = k >> 1`), which effectively divides `k` by 2 and floors the result.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- The loop terminates when `k` becomes 0, which means all bits in `k0` have been processed.
- The final value of `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, which is the number of times the loop executed.
- The list `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary `1101`), `arr` will be `[0, 2, 3]` because the 1st, 3rd, and 4th bits are set to 1.
