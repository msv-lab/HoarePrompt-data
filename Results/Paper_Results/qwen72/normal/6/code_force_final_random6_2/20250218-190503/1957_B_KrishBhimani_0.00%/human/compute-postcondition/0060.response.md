Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[1]` if `k` (after the update) is even, or a list containing `[0, 1]` if `k` (after the update) is odd, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in the original `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is an empty list if `k` is even, or a list containing `[0]` if `k` is odd.
- The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`.
- Therefore, if `k` is even, `arr` becomes `[1]`.
- If `k` is odd, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The state of `ans` and `c` remains as described in the initial state, but `arr` has been updated.
