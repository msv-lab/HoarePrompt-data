To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. This condition must be true for the loop to start. The state right before the loop includes the information that `i` is less than or equal to `j`, but it does not specify the values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the information:
- The loop will terminate when `i` is greater than `j` or when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
- If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` or `i` will be equal to `j` if the length of `arr` is odd.
- If the loop breaks, `i` and `j` will be at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. The other conditions do not need to be adjusted because they are already in a state that allows the loop to potentially execute.

State: **`i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
