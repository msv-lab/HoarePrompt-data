### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to understand the behavior of the program.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a single value. The cost is the length of the subarray.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly. The provided counterexample is:
```
1
5
1 2 2 2 3
```
The expected output is 3, but the program outputs 2.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `i = 0` and `j = len(arr) - 1` are set to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - The program then enters a loop to check if the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from the start and end.

2. **Palindrome Check Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= j` and `arr[i] == arr[j]`.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it means the array is a palindrome, and the function returns 0.
   - If the loop breaks, `i` and `j` are at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.

3. **Consecutive Duplicates Check:**
   - After breaking out of the palindrome check loop, the program enters another loop to skip consecutive duplicate elements starting from `i`.
   - This loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

4. **Final Return:**
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, the function returns `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is the last index of the array, the function returns `j - i`.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
For the input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 2 3
```
- **Step-by-Step Execution:**
  - `i = 0`, `j = 4`
  - `arr[0] == arr[4]` is false, so the loop breaks.
  - `i = 0`, `j = 4`
  - The program enters the second loop to skip consecutive duplicates starting from `i`.
  - `arr[0] == arr[1]` is false, so the loop does not increment `i`.
  - `i = 0`, `j = 4`
  - The program checks if `j != len(arr) - 1`, which is false.
  - The program returns `j - i`, which is `4 - 0 = 4`.

However, the expected output is 3, not 4. The program is indeed incorrect in this case.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If the array is a palindrome, the cost is 0.
- If the array is not a palindrome, we need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal. This can be done by finding the longest segment that can be made equal with the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    i = 0
    j = n - 1
    while i < j and arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    
    if i >= j:
        return 0
    
    # Find the minimum cost to make the array equal
    min_cost = n
    for x in set(arr):
        cost = 0
        for k in range(n):
            if arr[k] != x:
                cost += 1
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to compute the minimum number of burles required in some scenarios.

Final: **False**
