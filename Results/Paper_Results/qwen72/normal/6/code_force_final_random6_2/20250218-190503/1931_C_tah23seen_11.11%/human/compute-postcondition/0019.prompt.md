Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= j:
    if arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq \text{len(arr)}\). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 2\), and the first element of `arr` (`arr[i-1]`) is equal to the last element of `arr` (`arr[j+1]`). Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `j` remains \(\text{len(arr)} - 1\), and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq \text{len(arr)}\). The first element of `arr` (`arr[0]`) is equal to the last element of `arr` (`arr[\text{len(arr)} - 1]`). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 3\). Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 2\), and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
