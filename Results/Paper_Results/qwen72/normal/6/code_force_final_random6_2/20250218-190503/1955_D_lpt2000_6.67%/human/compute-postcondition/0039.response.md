Postcondition: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`. If `E[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `tot` is updated to `tot - 1`. `fnd` is 1 if the updated `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.**
