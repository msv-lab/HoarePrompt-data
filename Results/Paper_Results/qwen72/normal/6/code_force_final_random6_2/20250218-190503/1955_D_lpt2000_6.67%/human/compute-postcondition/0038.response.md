Output State: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the first `m` elements of `aa` and all elements in `bb`, with `D[out_aa]` decremented by 1, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, with `C[out_aa]` incremented by 1, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, now `tot - 1`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.**
