Postcondition: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer greater than `m`, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `aa` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `in_aa` is `aa[m + 1]`, `out_aa` is `aa[1]`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in the new `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the current window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in the new `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the new `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, and `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, and `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `C[aa[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
