#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), and `k` (an integer). The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `1 <= k <= len(b) <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5`, and each element in `a` and `b` should be an integer in the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) as the first parameter.
def func():

    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        
        E = cnt_aa - D
        
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        tot = sum(D.values())
        
        fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
        
        for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                    C[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            tot = sum(D.values())

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `nabors` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the final input integers provided by the user, `aa` is the final list of integers provided by the user, `bb` is the final list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of the final `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in the final `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the final window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the final window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the final `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during all the loop's executions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `aa` and `bb`. It then calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in `aa` contains at least `k` elements that are also present in `bb`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the final values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, and the various Counter objects used for calculations. The function does not return any value.
