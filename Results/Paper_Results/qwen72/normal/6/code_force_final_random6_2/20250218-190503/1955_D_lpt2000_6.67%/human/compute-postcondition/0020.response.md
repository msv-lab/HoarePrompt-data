Postcondition: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the first `m` elements of `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, and the current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. If `E[out_aa]` > 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is set to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
