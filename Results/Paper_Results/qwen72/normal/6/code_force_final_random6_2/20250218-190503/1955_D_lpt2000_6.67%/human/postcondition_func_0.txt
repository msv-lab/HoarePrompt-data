The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `aa` and `bb`. It then calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in `aa` contains at least `k` elements that are also present in `bb`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the final values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, and the various Counter objects used for calculations. The function does not return any value.
