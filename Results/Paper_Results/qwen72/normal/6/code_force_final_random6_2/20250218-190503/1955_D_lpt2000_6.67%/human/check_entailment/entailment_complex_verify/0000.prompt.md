You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), and `k` (an integer). The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `1 <= k <= len(b) <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5`, and each element in `a` and `b` should be an integer in the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) as the first parameter.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `nabors` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the final input integers provided by the user, `aa` is the final list of integers provided by the user, `bb` is the final list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of the final `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in the final `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the final window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the final window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the final `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during all the loop's executions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `aa` and `bb`. It then calculates the number of times a sliding window of size `m` in `aa` contains at least `k` elements that are also present in `bb`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the final values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, and the various Counter objects used for calculations. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` when sliding the window over the array `aa`. Specifically, the logic for updating `D`, `E`, and `C` when an element is removed from the window and a new element is added is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect counts of matching elements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 2 1
1 2 3
```

The expected output is `3` because the subsegments `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 2]`, and `[3, 2, 1]` all have at least 2 elements that match the elements in `b`. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly updates the counters when the window slides over the array.

To correct this, the program should properly handle the addition and removal of elements from the window, ensuring that the counts in `D` and `E` are updated correctly.
