Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, and `k` is the second integer read from the input line. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then the relationship between `n` and `k` is such that if `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`. If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then the relationship between `n` and `k` is such that if `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.***
