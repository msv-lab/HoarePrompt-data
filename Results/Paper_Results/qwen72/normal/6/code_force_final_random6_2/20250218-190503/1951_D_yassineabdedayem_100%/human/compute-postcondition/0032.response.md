Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(0 < t < 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- The conditions provided are:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
  - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
  - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the integer `1`.
- The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the value being printed by the `print` statement.
- The conditions are only used to describe the relationship between `n` and `k`, but they do not change the value of `1` being printed.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
