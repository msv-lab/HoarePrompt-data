Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(0 < t < 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides conditions for the variables `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the value being printed in the code snippet.
- The code snippet simply prints the integer `2`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(2)` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` or the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **2**
