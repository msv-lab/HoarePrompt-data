Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t < 1000.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- The relationship between `n` and `k` is such that:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either:
    - `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, or
    - `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `n` and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always execute and print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` because it is a fixed string and does not depend on any variables or conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
