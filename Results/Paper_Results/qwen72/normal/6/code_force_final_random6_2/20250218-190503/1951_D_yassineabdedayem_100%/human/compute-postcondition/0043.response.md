Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function then checks the following conditions for each test case:
- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines, each containing the number 1.
- If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines: the first line contains the number 2, and the second line contains the values `n - k + 1` and 1.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes execution. **
