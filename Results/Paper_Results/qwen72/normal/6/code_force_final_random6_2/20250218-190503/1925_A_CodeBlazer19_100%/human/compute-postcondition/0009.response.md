Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a sequence of all lowercase English letters.
   - The slice `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` will take the first `k` characters from this string.
   - The result of the slice is then multiplied by `n`, which means the first `k` characters will be repeated `n` times.
   - The final string is printed.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `k` and `n` are input integers, their exact values are not known from the initial state.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **The first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times (where `k` and `n` are the input integers)**
