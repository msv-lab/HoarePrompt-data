Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is the alphabet in lowercase.
   - The slice `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` will take the first `k` characters from this string.
   - The result of the slice is then multiplied by `n`, which means the sliced string will be repeated `n` times.
   - The final string is printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the first `k` characters of the alphabet string, repeated `n` times.
   - Since `k` and `n` are input integers, the exact output will depend on their values.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where the first `k` characters of the alphabet string are repeated `n` times)**
