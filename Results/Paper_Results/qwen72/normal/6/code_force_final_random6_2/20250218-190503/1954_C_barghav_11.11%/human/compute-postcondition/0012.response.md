Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`, `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a[i]` is now equal to `n`, `b[i]` is now equal to `m`.** 

In natural language: The initial conditions for `x`, `y`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still greater than or equal to half the length of `a`. The variables `n` and `m` still hold the minimum and maximum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` respectively. However, `a[i]` is now set to the minimum value `n`, and `b[i]` is now set to the maximum value `m`.
