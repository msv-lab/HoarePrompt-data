The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. `x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of both `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits.

For each test case, the function processes the integers `x` and `y` and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` of the same length (1 to 100 digits) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It returns a result for each test case based on the logic applied to `x` and `y`.**
