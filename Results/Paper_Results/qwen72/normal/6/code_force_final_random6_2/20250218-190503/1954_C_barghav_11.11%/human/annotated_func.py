#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x and y is between 1 and 100 digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` and `y` remain integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `x` and `y` remain integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively, with `a` having at least `len(a)` characters. For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop has printed all characters in `b` from index 0 to the last index, and `i` has been redefined by the loop to be the last index of `b`. The state of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `t` remains unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes two input strings `a` and `b` of equal length, where each character is a digit from 1 to 9. For the first half of the strings, it swaps the characters such that `a` contains the maximum and `b` contains the minimum of the corresponding characters. For the second half, it swaps the characters such that `a` contains the minimum and `b` contains the maximum of the corresponding characters. The function then prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value and does not modify the original input strings `x` and `y`. The number of test cases `t` is not directly used or modified within the function.
