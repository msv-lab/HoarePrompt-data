To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and their length is between 1 and 100 digits.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters derived from the input strings `x` and `y`.
   - For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`):
     - Each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
     - Each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
   - For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end):
     - Each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
     - Each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(a[i], end='')` statement prints the first character of the list `a` without a newline.

3. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is 0, we are looking at the first character of `a`.
   - According to the initial state, for the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
   - Therefore, `a[0]` will be the maximum of the first characters of the original `a` and `b`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first character of `a` is the maximum of the first characters of `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state, the output of the `print(a[i], end='')` statement will be the maximum of the first characters of the strings `x` and `y`.

Output: **max(x[0], y[0])** (where `x[0]` and `y[0]` are the first characters of the strings `x` and `y`, respectively)
