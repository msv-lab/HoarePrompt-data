Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `a[i]` is now equal to the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is now equal to the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`, `a[i]` is now equal to the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is now equal to the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. `i` is `len(a) // 2`, and `len(a)` must be greater than `len(a) // 2`. If `i` <= `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the element at index `i` in `a` is now `m`, while the element at index `i` in `b` is now `n`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is now the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is now equal to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. `i` is `len(a) // 2 + 1`, and `len(a)` must be greater than `len(a) // 2 + 1. If `i` <= `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `n` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a[i]` is now `m`, and `b[i]` is now `n`. Otherwise, `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a[i]` is now `n`, and `b[i]` is now `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
