The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 18).
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the third element to the end of `lst` plus 4.
- If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, and `r` and `l` are both [1, 2].

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `j` must still be less than the length of `lst`. Therefore, `j` will be 3, and `lst` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the third element to the end of `lst` plus 4. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, and `r` and `l` are both [1, 2].**
