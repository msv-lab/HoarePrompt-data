Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 3. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 1 and `over_sum` is updated to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `sm` is `over_sum - lst[1] + 1`.

Code:
```
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. `sum(lst[:i])` calculates the sum of the elements in `lst` from the start up to but not including index `i`. Since `i` is 0, this sum is 0.
2. `sum(lst[j + 1:])` calculates the sum of the elements in `lst` starting from index `j + 1` to the end. Since `j` is 3, this sum is `sum(lst[4:])`.
3. `(j - i + 1) ** 2` calculates the square of the expression `j - i + 1`. With `j` being 3 and `i` being 0, this evaluates to `(3 - 0 + 1) ** 2 = 4 ** 2 = 16`.
4. `sm` is updated to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `0 + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.**
