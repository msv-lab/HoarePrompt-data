### Reasoning:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not calculate the MEX of the selected subarray. Instead, it calculates the sum of the elements before and after the subarray and adds the square of the subarray's length. This is not the correct approach to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.
   - The MEX of a set is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The program should identify the MEX of the subarray and then replace the elements of the subarray with this MEX value.

2. **Operation Limit**:
   - The original assessment is correct in noting that the program does not ensure that the operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times. The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` can lead to an excessive number of operations, especially if the subarray is large.
   - The function `func_2` recursively appends operations to the `ops` list, which can result in a large number of operations, potentially exceeding the limit.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The original assessment is correct that the program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required. The program only returns the modified list and the operations list, but it does not print the required output format.
   - The program should print the maximum sum and the number of operations in the first line, followed by the operations in subsequent lines.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The original assessment is correct in noting that the program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is already optimal (like in the second example where the initial sum is 13), the program should output 0 operations, but it does not do that.
   - The program will attempt to perform operations even when no operations are needed, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  1 3 9
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  13 0
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and does not handle the case where no operations are needed. It will likely attempt to perform operations and modify the array, leading to an incorrect sum and an incorrect number of operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation, does not ensure the operation limit, does not format the output correctly, and does not handle edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
