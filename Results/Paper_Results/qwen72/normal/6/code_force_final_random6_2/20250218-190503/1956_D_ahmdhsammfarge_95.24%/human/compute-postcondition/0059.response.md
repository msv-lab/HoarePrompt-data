Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and returns two indices, `r` and `l`. These indices correspond to the positions in `lst` where the sum of the elements before `i`, the elements after `j`, and the square of the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (inclusive) is maximized. The function does not modify the input list `lst`. **
