Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 3, `l` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.**

The variable `over_sum` is assigned the value of `sm`, which is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`. The other variables remain unchanged.
