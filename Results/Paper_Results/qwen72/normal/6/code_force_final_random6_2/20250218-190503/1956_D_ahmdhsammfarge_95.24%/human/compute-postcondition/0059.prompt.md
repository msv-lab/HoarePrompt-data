You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers with length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18). `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop iterations, and `r` and `l` are set to the corresponding indices `[i, j]` where this maximum `sm` was found.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` where `r` is `n - 1` and `l` is `len(lst) - 1`. These indices correspond to the positions in the list `lst` where the maximum value of `sm` was found during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `lst` with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and returns two indices, `r` and `l`, where `r` is `n - 1` and `l` is `len(lst) - 1`. These indices indicate the positions in `lst` where the maximum value of `sm` was found during the loop iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the indices `r` and `l` where `r` is `n - 1` and `l` is `len(lst) - 1`. These indices correspond to the positions in the list `lst` where the maximum value of `sm` was found during the loop iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
