Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `l` is 1, `j` is 2, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.**

Explanation:
- The code `over_sum = sm` updates the value of `over_sum` to be equal to `sm`.
- According to the initial state, if `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 1 and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Since the code `over_sum = sm` is executed, it implies that `sm` was indeed greater than the original `over_sum`, and thus `l` is 1.
- The value of `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, and this value is now also assigned to `over_sum`.
- The other variables (`lst`, `i`, `r`, `j`) remain unchanged.
