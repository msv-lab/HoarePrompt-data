Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the third element to the end of `lst` plus 4, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` is [1, 2], `l` is [1, 2].**

The variables `r` and `l` are both assigned the list `[1, 2]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `lst`, `n`, `sm`, and `over_sum` are still valid.
