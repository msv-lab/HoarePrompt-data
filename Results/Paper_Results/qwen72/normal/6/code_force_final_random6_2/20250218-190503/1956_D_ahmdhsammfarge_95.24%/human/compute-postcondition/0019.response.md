Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 0, `r` is the value of `i` at the last iteration where `sm` > `over_sum`, `l` is the value of `j` at the last iteration where `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` is still 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `r` holds the value of `i` at the last iteration where the computed `sm` was greater than the current `over_sum`.
- The variable `l` holds the value of `j` at the last iteration where the computed `sm` was greater than the current `over_sum`.
- The variable `over_sum` holds the maximum value of `sm` that was found during the loop iterations, which is the sum of the elements before `i`, the sum of the elements after `j`, plus the square of the difference `(j - i + 1)`.
