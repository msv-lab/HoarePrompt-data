Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n + 1 - (n - 2) + 1), `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n + 1`**

Explanation:
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The variables `r` and `l` are assigned the values of `i` and `j` respectively.
- Therefore, `r` is `n - 2` and `l` is `n + 1`.
