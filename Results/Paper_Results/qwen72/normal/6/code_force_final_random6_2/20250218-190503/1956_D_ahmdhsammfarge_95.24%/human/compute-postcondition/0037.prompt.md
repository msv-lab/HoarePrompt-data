Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `r` is the value of `i` at the last iteration where `sm` > `over_sum`, `l` is the value of `j` at the last iteration where `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop iterations.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the third element to the end of `lst` plus 4. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, and `r` and `l` are both [1, 2].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fourth element to the end of `lst` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is updated to `sm`, `r` is [1, 3], and `l` is [1, 3]. Otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fifth element to the end of `lst` plus 16, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`, and in this case, `r` is [1, 4] and `l` is [1, 4]. Otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
