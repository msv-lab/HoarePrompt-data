Output State: **The program returns the updated list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` consists of `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The variables `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged, and `n` is still equal to `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value was not 0, no additional operations were performed.**
