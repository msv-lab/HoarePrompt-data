Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is an integer input.
   - `B` is an integer input.
   - `C` is an integer input.
   - `X` is equal to `A // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(X)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the result of integer division of `A` by 2.
   - Integer division (`//`) returns the quotient without the remainder. For example, if `A` is 7, then `X` will be 3 because 7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1.
   - Since `A` is an integer input, its value is not explicitly known, but it can be any integer.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(X)` statement will print the value of `X`, which is `A // 2`.

Output: **X (where X is the integer division of A by 2)**
