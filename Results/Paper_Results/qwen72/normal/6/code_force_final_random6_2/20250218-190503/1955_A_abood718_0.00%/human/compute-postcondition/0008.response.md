Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `C` is an integer, and `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. Additionally, `A` is an odd integer. `X` is equal to `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `X` is assigned the result of the integer division of `A` by 2. Since `A` is an odd integer, `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
