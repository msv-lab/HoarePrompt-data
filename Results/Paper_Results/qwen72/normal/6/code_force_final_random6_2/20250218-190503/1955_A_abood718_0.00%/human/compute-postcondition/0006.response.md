Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `A` is an integer and is even.
   - `B` is an integer.
   - `C` is an integer.
   - `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be printed is `int(A * C / 2)`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - `A` is an even integer. This means \(A \mod 2 = 0\).
   - `C` is an integer.
   - The expression `A * C / 2` will be an integer because `A` is even, and dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer.
   - The `int` function will convert the result of `A * C / 2` to an integer, but since the result is already an integer, it will not change the value.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the integer value of `A * C / 2`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **A * C / 2 (where A is an even integer and C is an integer)**
