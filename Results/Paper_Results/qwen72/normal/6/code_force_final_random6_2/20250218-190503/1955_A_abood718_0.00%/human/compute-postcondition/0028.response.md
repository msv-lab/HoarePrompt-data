Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is an integer input.
   - `B` is an integer input.
   - `C` is an integer input.
   - `X` is equal to `A // 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be printed is `X * C + B`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`. This means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, which results in the largest integer less than or equal to \( \frac{A}{2} \).
   - `X * C` multiplies the value of `X` by `C`.
   - `X * C + B` adds the value of `B` to the result of `X * C`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are the integer inputs provided)**
