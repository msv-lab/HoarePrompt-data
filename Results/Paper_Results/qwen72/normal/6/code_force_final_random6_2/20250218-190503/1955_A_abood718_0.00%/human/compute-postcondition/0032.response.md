The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints specify that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case having `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`.

The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, and returns a result for each test case.**
