Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price for two yogurts `b`. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` should be named `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively for better readability and to match the problem description.

2. **Promotion Check**: The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks if the regular price of two yogurts is less than the promotional price. If this is true, it prints `A * B`, which is correct because it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**: The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is also correct because it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: The condition `else` handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It calculates `X = A // 2` (the number of pairs) and then prints `X` and `X * C + B`. This is incorrect because it prints two values instead of one, and the calculation `X * C + B` is not the correct way to handle the odd case. The correct approach should be to buy `A // 2` pairs at the promotional price and then buy one additional yogurt at the regular price, which would be `X * C + B`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not handle the odd number of yogurts correctly and prints an extra value.

Correctness: **False**
