Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is 2, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 2. If `B * 2 < C`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.***
