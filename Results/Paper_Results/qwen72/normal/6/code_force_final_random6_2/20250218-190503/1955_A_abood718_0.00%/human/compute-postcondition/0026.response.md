Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is 2, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input, `X` is equal to `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `A`, `B`, `C`) remain unchanged. The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 2 is still valid, but it does not affect the current state since no input is taken in this code snippet.
