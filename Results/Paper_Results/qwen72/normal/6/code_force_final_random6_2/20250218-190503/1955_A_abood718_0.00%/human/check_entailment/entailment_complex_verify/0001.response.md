### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotations:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
     - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
     - The program prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the regular price.
     - This part of the logic is correct.

   - **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, then Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - The program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - This part of the logic is correct.

   - **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, then Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.
     - The program prints `X` (which is `A // 2`), and then prints `X * C + B`.
     - This is incorrect because the program should only print the total cost `X * C + B` and not the intermediate value `X`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for the first two cases is correct.
   - The logic for the third case is almost correct, but the program incorrectly prints `X` before the final result.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the reasoning and the annotated version of the code, the original program is incorrect due to the extra print statement in the third case. The corrected program should only print the total cost `X * C + B` for the third case.

Final: **False**
