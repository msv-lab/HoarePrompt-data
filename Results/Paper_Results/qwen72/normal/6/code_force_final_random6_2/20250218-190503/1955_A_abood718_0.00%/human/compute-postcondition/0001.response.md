Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `C` is an integer.**

The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned based on the input provided by the user, which is split into three integers. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
