The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the result of `int(input())`. If `i` is less than the result of `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, and `C` is an integer input. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no additional changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, no additional changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
