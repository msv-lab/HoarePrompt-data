Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must be a non-empty set, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', otherwise `temp` is an empty set, and `c` is either '1' or '?'. Additionally, `temp` now contains the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- The value of `r` remains the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- The value of `c` remains the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, which can be either '1' or '?'.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `m` remains `m - 1`.
- The value of `x` remains the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` remains a non-empty set.
- The set `temp` now contains the value `(q - r) % n` in addition to any previous values it had. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` already contained `(q + r) % n`, and now it also contains `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1', `temp` was initially empty, and now it contains `(q - r) % n`.
