Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next value in `ans`, `temp` has a new element added which is `(q - r) % n`.** 

In this state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include a new element, which is the result of `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain as they were in the initial state, except for `temp`, which has been modified.
