Postcondition: ***`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next value in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n` and possibly `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.***
