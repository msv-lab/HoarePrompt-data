The function `read` is intended to read input data for the game described. It is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, the starting player `x`, and a list of throws, each defined by a distance `r_i` and a direction `c_i` ('0', '1', or '?'). The input is structured such that the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent test case starts with three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` followed by `m` lines, each containing `r_i` and `c_i`. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, and 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
