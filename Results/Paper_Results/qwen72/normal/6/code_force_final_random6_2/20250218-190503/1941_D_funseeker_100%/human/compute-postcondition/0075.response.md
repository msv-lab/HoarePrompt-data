Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop. `m` is 0, and `temp` is an empty set. If `0` is in `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
