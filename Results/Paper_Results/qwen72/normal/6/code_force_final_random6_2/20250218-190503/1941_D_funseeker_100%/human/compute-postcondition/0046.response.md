Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans)`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a non-empty set, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '?', or containing all possible values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1', or remains an empty set if `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?'.**

### Explanation:
- **`r` and `c`**: These values are determined by the string returned by `func_1()` and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: The value of `m` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop iterates over all elements in `ans`, `m` will be decremented by the number of elements in `ans`, resulting in `m - len(ans)`.
- **`x`**: This value is determined by the function `func_3()` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`ans`**: This set is the collection of values that the loop iterates over. It remains non-empty and unchanged by the loop itself.
- **`temp`**: The set `temp` is populated based on the value of `c`:
  - If `c` is '?', `temp` will contain all possible values of both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
  - If `c` is '1', `temp` will contain all possible values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
  - If `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` will remain an empty set.
