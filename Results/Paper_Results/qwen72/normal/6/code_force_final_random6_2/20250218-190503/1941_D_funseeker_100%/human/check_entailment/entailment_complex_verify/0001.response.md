### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `map(int, func_1().split())` to parse integers from the input. This is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python, especially for competitive programming.
   - The `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` functions are well-defined and correctly handle the input as described.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the clockwise direction.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the counterclockwise direction.
   - The use of set operations ensures that duplicate positions are not added, and the set remains efficient.

4. **Handling Zero Position:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and a position of `0` should be adjusted to `n`.
   - This adjustment is correctly implemented.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is the correct format for the output as specified in the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the ball could end up at position `0` and correctly adjusts it to `n`.
   - The program also handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`) by considering both possible directions.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of set operations and the modulo operation ensures that the program efficiently handles the circular nature of the game and the potential large number of players and throws.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading:**
  - `func_1()` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace.
  - `func_2()` converts the input to an integer.
  - `func_3()` splits the input line by spaces and converts each part to an integer.
  - `func_4()` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The set `ans` is used to keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
  - For each throw, the program considers both possible directions if the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - The use of set operations ensures that duplicate positions are not added, and the set remains efficient.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `q % n` is used to handle the circular nature of the game. This ensures that the position wraps around correctly when it exceeds `n` or goes below `1`.

- **Adjusting Zero Position:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the position is `0` by converting it to `n`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the number of possible players and then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws, considering both known and unknown directions. It handles the circular nature of the game and the input/output format as specified in the problem statement.

The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
