Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
        if len(s) < 200:
            print('YES')
            print(s)
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, otherwise the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and is greater than 0. If `n` is odd, `n` remains the input integer and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`. If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` is less than 200. Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive, and is greater than 0. If `n` is odd, `n` is the input integer and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`. If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` remains less than 200. If `n // 2 * 3` is greater than or equal to 200, the length of `s` remains greater than or equal to 200.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
