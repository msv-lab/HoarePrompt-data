You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the function prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the function prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is 0 correctly. According to the problem description, `n` can be any integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The program should print "NO" for `n = 0` because there is no string with exactly 0 special characters that meets the criteria (a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors). However, the program does not account for this edge case and would incorrectly print "NO" for `n = 0` instead of handling it as an invalid input.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is 2 correctly. For `n = 2`, the program generates the string "AAB", which has only 1 special character (the second 'A'), not 2. The correct output for `n = 2` should be a string like "MM" or "AA", which has exactly 2 special characters. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for this case.
