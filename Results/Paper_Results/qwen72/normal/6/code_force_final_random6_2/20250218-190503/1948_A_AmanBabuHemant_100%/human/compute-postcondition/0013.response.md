Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, otherwise the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.***
