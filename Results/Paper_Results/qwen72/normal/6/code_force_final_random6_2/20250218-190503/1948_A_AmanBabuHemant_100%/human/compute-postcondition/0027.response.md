Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive, and is greater than 0.
- If `n` is odd:
  - `n` is the input integer.
  - `s` is not defined.
- If `n` is even:
  - `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
  - The length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`.
  - If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` is less than 200.
  - Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'YES'.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, and the string `s` if `n` is even. However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
