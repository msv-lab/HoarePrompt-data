Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal, `ii` is 0. If the first two elements of `onum` are equal, `ck` is 1. Otherwise, the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal, `ii` is 1, and `ck` is 2 if the second element of `onum` is equal to the first element of `onum`. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 if the first two elements of `onum` are equal, and the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal, `ii` is 2, and `ck` is 3 if the second element of `onum` is equal to the first element of `onum` and `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`. Otherwise, `ck` is 2 if the second element of `onum` is equal to the first element of `onum` and `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `ck` is 1 if the first two elements of `onum` are equal, and the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
