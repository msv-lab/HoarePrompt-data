Postcondition: ***`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 3. Otherwise, `cn` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
