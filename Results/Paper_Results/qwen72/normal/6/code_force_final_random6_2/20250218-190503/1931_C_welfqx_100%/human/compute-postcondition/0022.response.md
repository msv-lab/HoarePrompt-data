Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `n` is 1 or all elements in `num` are equal (`f` is 1), the program follows the conditions specified in the if part.***
