The only objects in the loop head are `ii` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. The variable `ii` is the loop iterator and should start at 0 for the loop to begin.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1, which means `n - 1` is at least 0.
- `ii` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1**
