Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal. `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- The input integer `t` remains within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `r` remains 1.
- The input integer `n` is greater than 1.
- The list `num` remains unchanged.
- The variable `j` is the index where the loop detected that `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, or it is `n - 2` if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal.
- The list `onum` remains a reversed copy of `num`.
- The variables `symb1` and `symb2` remain the first and last elements of `num`, respectively.
- The variable `i` is the index where the loop detected that `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, or it is `n - 2` if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal.
- The variable `ii` is the index where the loop detected that `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, or it is `n - 2` if all consecutive elements in `onum` are equal.
- The variable `cn` is updated to `cn + ck` if the first and last elements of `num` are equal, where `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.
- The variable `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise it remains 1.
