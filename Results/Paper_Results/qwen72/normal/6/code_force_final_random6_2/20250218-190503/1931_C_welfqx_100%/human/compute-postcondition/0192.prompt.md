You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        f = 1
        
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
                f = 0
                break
        
        if n == 1 or f == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        onum = num.copy()
        
        onum.reverse()
        
        cn = 1
        
        ck = 1
        
        f = 1
        
        symb1 = num[0]
        
        symb2 = onum[0]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break
        
        for ii in range(n - 1):
            if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
                ck += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if symb1 == symb2:
            cn += ck
        
        print(n - max(cn, ck))
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal, `ck` is the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`. The loop has printed `n - max(cn, ck)` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the size of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= n). The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is implied to be based on the contents of the array `a` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
