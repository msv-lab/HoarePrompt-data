Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `num`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `i`, `ii`, `cn`, and `ck` remain unchanged except for `num`, which is now a list of integers derived from the input.
- The values of `symb1` and `symb2` will be updated based on the new `num` list, but since the initial state already defines them as the first and last elements of `num`, they remain consistent with the new `num`.
- The values of `i`, `ii`, `j`, `cn`, and `ck` will be determined by the logic that follows, but since the code snippet provided only updates `num`, the initial state for these variables remains unchanged.
