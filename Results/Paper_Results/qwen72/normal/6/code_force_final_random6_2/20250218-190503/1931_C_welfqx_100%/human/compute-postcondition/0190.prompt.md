Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array. The array `a` contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is `cn + ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`. If the loop breaks, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start up to `ii`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is `n - 2`, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`. If all characters in `num` from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal to their respective next characters, `cn` is `2 * (n - 1)` and `j` is the index where the first inequality was found. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` for all `ii` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `ck` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ck` is the number of consecutive characters from the start of `onum` that are equal to their respective next characters, and the loop breaks at the first inequality. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `symb1` and `symb2` are the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
