Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0] + 1` otherwise `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, `ans[2]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[1]` that is greater than `arr[1] + ans[1]` if `ans[2]` is less than `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` remains as `arr[1] + ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is `arr[2] + ans[2]` and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, `i` is 2, and `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:

- The list `arr` remains unchanged, with each element still being an integer between 1 and 500.
- The integer `n` also remains unchanged, still being an integer between 4 and 500.
- The list `ans` is modified as follows:
  - `ans[0]` is still `arr[0] + 1`.
  - `ans[1]` is still `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0] + 1`, otherwise it is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`.
  - `ans[2]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[1]` that is greater than `arr[1] + ans[1]` if `ans[2]` is less than `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` remains as `arr[1] + ans[1]`.
  - `ans[3]` is `arr[2] + ans[2]` and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`.

The loop continues to add `ans[2]` to `ans[3]` until `ans[3]` is greater than `arr[3]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `ans[3]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[3]` that is a multiple of `ans[2]` added to `arr[2]`. All other elements in `ans` remain zeros.
