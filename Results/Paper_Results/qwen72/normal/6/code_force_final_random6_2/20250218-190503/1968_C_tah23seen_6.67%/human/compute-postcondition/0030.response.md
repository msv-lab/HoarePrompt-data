Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0] + 1` otherwise `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, `ans[2]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[1]` that is greater than `arr[1] + ans[1]` if `ans[2]` is less than `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` remains as `arr[1] + ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is `arr[2] + ans[2] + ans[2] + ans[2] + ans[2]`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, `i` is 2, and `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2] + ans[2] + ans[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[3]` by adding `ans[2]` to it.
- Initially, `ans[3]` is `arr[2] + ans[2] + ans[2] + ans[2]`.
- After the code execution, `ans[3]` becomes `arr[2] + ans[2] + ans[2] + ans[2] + ans[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
