Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than `arr[0] + 1` otherwise `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, `ans[2]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[1]` that is greater than `arr[1] + ans[1]`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, `i` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The initial state sets up `ans` such that `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]` if it is greater than `arr[0] + 1`, otherwise `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[2]` is `arr[1] + ans[1]`.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop continues to add `ans[1]` to `ans[2]` until `ans[2]` is greater than `arr[2]`. This means `ans[2]` will eventually be the smallest multiple of `ans[1]` that is greater than `arr[1] + ans[1]`.
- **Final State**: After the loop completes, `ans[2]` will be the smallest multiple of `ans[1]` that is greater than `arr[1] + ans[1]`. The rest of the elements in `ans` remain zeros, and `i` remains 1.
