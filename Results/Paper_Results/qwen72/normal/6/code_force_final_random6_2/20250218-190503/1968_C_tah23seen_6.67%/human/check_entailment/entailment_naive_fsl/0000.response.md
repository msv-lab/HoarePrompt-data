Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array `arr` contains values that would cause the constructed array `ans` to violate the condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). Specifically, the program may generate values of `ans[i]` that exceed \(10^9\), which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 1
```
The program will generate the array `ans` as follows:
- `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 1 + 2 = 3`
- `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`
- `ans[3] = ans[2] + arr[2] = 4 + 1 = 5`

This output is:
```
2 3 4 5
```
However, if we consider a larger input where the values in `arr` are close to the upper limit (500), the values in `ans` can grow very large and exceed \(10^9\). For instance:
```
1
4
499 499 499
```
The program will generate:
- `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 499 + 1 = 500`
- `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 499 + 500 = 999`
- `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 499 + 999 = 1498`
- `ans[3] = ans[2] + arr[2] = 1498 + 499 = 1997`

This output is:
```
500 999 1498 1997
```
Here, `ans[2]` and `ans[3]` both exceed \(10^9\), which is not allowed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
