Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) contains an arrow pointing to the left (`<`). This is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
In this case, the robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move as follows:
1. From `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)` (since the arrow in `(1, 1)` points right).
2. From `(1, 2)` to `(2, 2)` (since the arrow in `(1, 2)` points down).
3. From `(2, 2)` to `(2, 3)` (since the arrow in `(2, 2)` points right).
4. From `(2, 3)` to `(2, 4)` (since the arrow in `(2, 3)` points right).

The robot can reach the cell `(2, 4)`, so the correct output should be `YES`. However, the program will output `No` because `b[n - 2]` (which is `b[2]` in this case) is `<`.

This example demonstrates that the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell in all cases.
