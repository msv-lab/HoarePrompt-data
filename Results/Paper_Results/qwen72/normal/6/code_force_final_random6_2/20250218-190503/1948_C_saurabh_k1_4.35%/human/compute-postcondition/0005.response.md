Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.
- `n` is an input integer. This means `n` is an integer that is provided as input to the function.
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the input integer `n` must be a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of characters read from input.
- `b` is a list of characters read from input.
- The second-to-last character of `b` is '<'.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and the structure of the input, but it does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
