You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, the function checks if the second-to-last character of the second string `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the state of the program remains as it was before the function call, except that the output has been printed to the standard output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) contains an arrow pointing to the left (`<`). This is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
In this case, the robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move as follows:
1. From `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)` (since the arrow in `(1, 1)` points right).
2. From `(1, 2)` to `(2, 2)` (since the arrow in `(1, 2)` points down).
3. From `(2, 2)` to `(2, 3)` (since the arrow in `(2, 2)` points right).
4. From `(2, 3)` to `(2, 4)` (since the arrow in `(2, 3)` points right).

The robot can reach the cell `(2, 4)`, so the correct output should be `YES`. However, the program will output `No` because `b[n - 2]` (which is `b[2]` in this case) is `<`.

This example demonstrates that the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell in all cases.
