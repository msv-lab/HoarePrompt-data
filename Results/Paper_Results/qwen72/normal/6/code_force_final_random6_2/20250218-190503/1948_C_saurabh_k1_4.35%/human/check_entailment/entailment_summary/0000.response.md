Reasoning:  
The given program checks if the second-to-last character of the second string `b` is '<'. If it is, the program prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. However, this logic is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) because it only considers one specific condition and does not account for all possible movements and interactions between the arrows in the grid.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to consider the following:

1. **Movement Constraints**: The robot must always move to a valid cell and cannot skip a move.
2. **Arrow Interactions**: The robot must follow the arrows in the cells it moves to, and these arrows can potentially lead it to different cells, including back to the starting cell or other cells that prevent it from reaching (2, n).

The program's logic is flawed because:
- It only checks the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[n-2]`). This character alone does not determine if the robot can reach (2, n).
- The robot's path is influenced by the arrows in both rows, and it can move between rows and columns multiple times.

A correct solution would involve simulating the robot's movements from the starting cell (1, 1) and checking if it can eventually reach the target cell (2, n). This simulation would need to consider the direction of each arrow and the robot's movement rules.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
