Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can be any integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing:
  - An integer `n`.
  - Two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This implies that `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of characters read from input.
- `b` is a list of characters read from input.
- The second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'. This means the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', given that `b` consists only of '<' and '>', and `b` is at least 2 characters long.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string 'Yes'.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and the structure of the input, but none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print 'Yes' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **Yes**
