The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, the function checks if the second-to-last character of the second string `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the state of the program remains as it was before the function call, except that the output has been printed to the standard output for each test case.
