To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which should be equivalent to `t` in this context.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
