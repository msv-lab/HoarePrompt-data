Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of characters read from input, `b` is a list of characters read from input, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '<'.**
