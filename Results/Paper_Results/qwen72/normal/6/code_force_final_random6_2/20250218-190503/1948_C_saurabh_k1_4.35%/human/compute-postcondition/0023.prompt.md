Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n and two strings of length n, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of characters read from input, `b` is a list of characters read from input. If the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `a` and `b` are lists of characters read from input. If the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `a` is a list of characters read from input, `b` is a list of characters read from input, and `_` is incremented by 1 if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', otherwise `_` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
