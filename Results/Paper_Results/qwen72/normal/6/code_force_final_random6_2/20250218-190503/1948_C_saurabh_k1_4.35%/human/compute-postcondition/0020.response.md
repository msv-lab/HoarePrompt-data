Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This means `n` represents the length of the strings in each test case.
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `a` is a list of characters read from input.
- `b` is a list of characters read from input.
- `_` is incremented by 1 if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', otherwise `_` is unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` are not directly relevant to what is printed by this `print` statement, as the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_`.

Output: **No**
