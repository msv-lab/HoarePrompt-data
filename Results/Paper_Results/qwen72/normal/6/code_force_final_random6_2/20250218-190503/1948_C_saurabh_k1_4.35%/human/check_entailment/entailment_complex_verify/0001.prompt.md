You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n and two strings of length n, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case where the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', otherwise `_` remains unchanged for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing characters '<' and '>'. For each test case, the function checks if the second-to-last character of the second string `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the state of the program remains as it was before the function call, except that the output has been printed to the standard output for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n). Each second, the robot makes two moves: one chosen by the user (left, right, up, or down) and one determined by the arrow in the current cell. The arrows in the grid are represented by the characters `<` (left) and `>` (right).

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of columns), and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it must move every second and cannot skip a move.
   - After the robot's move, it must follow the arrow in the current cell.

4. **Key Insight**:
   - To reach cell (2, n), the robot must eventually move to the second row and then move right to the last column.
   - The critical point is the second-to-last column in the second row (i.e., cell (2, n-1)). If the arrow in this cell points to the left (`<`), the robot cannot move to cell (2, n) because it will be forced back to the left.

5. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row (`b[n-2]`) points to the left (`<`).
   - If it does, the program prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `n` is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid, as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot might get stuck in a loop or be unable to move to the second row. However, the problem constraints and the nature of the grid (with only left and right arrows) imply that the robot can always move to the second row if it is not blocked by a left arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is correct for the given problem constraints. It correctly identifies whether the robot can reach cell (2, n) based on the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row.
