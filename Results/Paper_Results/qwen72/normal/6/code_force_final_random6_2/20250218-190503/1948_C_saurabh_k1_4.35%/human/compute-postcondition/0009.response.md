The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object that can be adjusted in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute again if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of characters read from input
- `b` is a list of characters read from input
- If the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute again if the next `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, the function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of characters read from input, `b` is a list of characters read from input, if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.**
