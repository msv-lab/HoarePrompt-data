Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `remaining_vertices` is empty. After all iterations, `path` will contain all the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) in some order, and `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set. The value of `d` will be 0. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately, but it does not change the state of any variables.**
