To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`. The loop iterates in a descending order from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `d` is `n - 1`.
- `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `v` and `u`.
- If `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list.
- We have exited the loop.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
1. The loop variable `d` must be decremented by 1, as the loop is iterating in reverse order.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `d` must be greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` was `n - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` will be `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `v` and `u`. If `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list.**
