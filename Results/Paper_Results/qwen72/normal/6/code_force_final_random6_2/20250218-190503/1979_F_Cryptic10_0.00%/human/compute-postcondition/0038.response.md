The value of `v` is removed from the set `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` is in `remaining_vertices` as per the precondition, after the removal, `remaining_vertices` will contain integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was also in `remaining_vertices`. The other variables (`n`, `path`, `d`, `u`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that now contains the value `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty.**
