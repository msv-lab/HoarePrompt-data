The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and represents the number of vertices in the graph. The function returns a value based on the input `n`.

Since the output details are not provided, I can only describe the input parameter and the general context of the function. If you provide the specific output conditions, I can refine the description further.
