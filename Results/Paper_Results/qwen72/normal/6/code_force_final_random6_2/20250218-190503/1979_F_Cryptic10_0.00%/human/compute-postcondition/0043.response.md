The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow control.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` and `u` if `u` was in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
