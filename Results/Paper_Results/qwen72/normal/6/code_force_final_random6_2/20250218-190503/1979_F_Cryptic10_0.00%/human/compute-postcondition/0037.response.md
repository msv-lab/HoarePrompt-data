Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that now contains the value `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Additionally, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation:
- The value `v` is appended to the list `path`.
- The initial state of `path` was that it may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. After appending `v`, `path` now contains this value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. `remaining_vertices` still contains integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and it must not be empty.
- `d` remains `n - 1`, and `v` and `u` are still the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- The condition that if `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, remains valid. However, since `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is not 0, and the loop is not skipped.
