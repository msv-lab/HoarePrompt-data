The function `func` is intended to process a series of test cases. Each test case contains a string of length 5, composed of the characters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. The input starts with an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a distinct string.
