You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process a series of test cases. Each test case contains a string of length 5, composed of the characters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. The input starts with an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a distinct string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, the program executes the else part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks that print 'A' or 'B' are not indented within the for loop that iterates over the test cases. This means that the program will only print the result for the last test case, and not for each individual test case as required by the problem description. To fix this, the print statements should be indented to be inside the loop that processes each test case.
