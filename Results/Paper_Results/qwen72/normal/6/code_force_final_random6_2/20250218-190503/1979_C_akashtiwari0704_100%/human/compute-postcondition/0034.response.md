Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[1]) + ' '`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` was `str(a[0]) + ' '`.
- After the code execution, `ans` becomes `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[1]) + ' '`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
