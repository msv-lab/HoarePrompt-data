Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is 1, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, and `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `l` is a non-empty list, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces if `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces if `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `i` is `bets + 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 2` elements, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces if `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
