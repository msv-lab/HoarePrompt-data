Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[2]` to `sumo`.
- Initially, `sumo` is the integer value of `a[0] + a[1]`.
- After the code execution, `sumo` is updated to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, `g`, `l`, `i`, `a`, and `prod` remain unchanged.
