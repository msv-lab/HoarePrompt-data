Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `l` is a list with at least `bets + 1` elements, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces if `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- The value of `i` is `bets`.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `l`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
