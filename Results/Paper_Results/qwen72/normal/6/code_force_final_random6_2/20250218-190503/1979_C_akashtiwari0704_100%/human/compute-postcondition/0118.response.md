Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `T` is equal to `t - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a` for each test case, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step for each test case, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements for each test case, `i` is `bets - 1` for each test case, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]` for each test case, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a` for each test case, and `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation for each test case. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is `-1`. If `sumo` is less than `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop variable `T` will have reached `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. For each test case, the variable `bets` will have been set to an input integer, and the list `a` will have been updated such that each element is the result of dividing the least common multiple (LCM) of the original elements by the corresponding original element. The variable `sumo` will contain the sum of these updated elements. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` (the LCM of the original elements) for any test case, the output for that test case will be `-1`. Otherwise, the output will be a string containing the updated elements of `a` separated by spaces.
