Output State: **`bets` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`, `T` is `t`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]` and `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[2]` to it.
- The initial value of `sumo` was `prod // a[0] + int(a[1])`.
- After the code execution, `sumo` becomes `prod // a[0] + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`.
- All other variables (`bets`, `i`, `T`, `ans`, `a`, and `prod`) remain unchanged.
