Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `T` remains 0.
- The variable `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- The variable `g` is still the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step.
- The list `l` still has at least `len(l)` elements.
- The variable `i` is now `bets - 1`.
- The list `a` remains a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`.
- The variable `prod` is still the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`.
- The variable `sumo` is still the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, and it remains less than `prod`.
- The variable `ans` is now a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.
