### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or reporting -1 if it is impossible.
   - Slimes can only eat their neighbors if they are strictly larger.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that finds the index of the smallest element in a list that is greater than or equal to a given value.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes each test case and calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function uses `bisect_left` to find the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1, which is correct because it indicates an invalid input.
   - It then finds the index using `bl` and checks if the element at that index is exactly `x`. If it is, it returns the index + 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the index found by `bl`.

4. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function initializes two lists: `left` and `last`.
   - `left` is a prefix sum array that stores the cumulative sum of the sizes of slimes up to each index.
   - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size of the slime was different from the previous slime.
   - `ans` is initialized to a list of -1s, representing the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - The function iterates through the slimes and updates the `last` list.
   - It then iterates through the slimes again to determine the minimum time for each slime to be eaten:
     - If the current slime is smaller than the previous slime, it can be eaten in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` which is the cumulative sum of sizes up to the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index of the smallest cumulative sum that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It then checks if this index is valid and updates the `ans` list accordingly.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` in `func_1` is appropriate for finding the smallest index greater than or equal to a given value.
   - The prefix sum array `left` is correctly constructed to keep track of the cumulative sizes of slimes.
   - The `last` list is used to efficiently find the last index where the size of the slime was different, which helps in determining the minimum time for a slime to be eaten.
   - The logic for updating the `ans` list is correct:
     - If a slime is smaller than its previous neighbor, it can be eaten in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum time by finding the appropriate index using `func_1` and checking the `last` list.
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where a slime is impossible to be eaten by returning -1.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a slime is impossible to be eaten by returning -1.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the slime is the first in the line and has no previous neighbor to compare with.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum time for each slime to be eaten or reporting -1 if it is impossible. The use of prefix sums and binary search (via `bisect_left`) is efficient and appropriate for the problem.

Final: **True**
