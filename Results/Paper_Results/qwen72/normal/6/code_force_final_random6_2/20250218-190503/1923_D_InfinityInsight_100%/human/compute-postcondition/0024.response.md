Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1, `i` is the last element in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `a`.
- **`n`**: The length of `a` remains the same, so `n` does not change.
- **`left`**: The list `left` now contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0. For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `left` will be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10]` after the loop finishes.
- **`last`**: The list `last` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `last`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `ans`.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` will be the last element in `a` after the loop finishes, as the loop iterates over each element of `a`.
