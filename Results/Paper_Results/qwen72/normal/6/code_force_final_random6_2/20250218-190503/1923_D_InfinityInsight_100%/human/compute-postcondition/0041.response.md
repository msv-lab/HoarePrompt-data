Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is `2 - inx` and `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, If `inx` is less than 0, `inx` is set to -1 and `inx2` is set to -1, and the program skips the rest of the current loop iteration.**
