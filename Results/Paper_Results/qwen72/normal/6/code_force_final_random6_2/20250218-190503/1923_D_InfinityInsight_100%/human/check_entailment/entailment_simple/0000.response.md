### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and their sizes `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2` twice: once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - The results from both calls are combined to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten, or -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point of `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1, which is a valid condition as `x` should be within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\).
   - If `a[inx]` is equal to `x`, it returns `inx + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten from the left.
   - It initializes `left` to store cumulative sums of the sizes of slimes.
   - It initializes `last` to store the index of the last occurrence of the same size before the current index.
   - It initializes `ans` to store the results, initially set to -1 for all slimes.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to update `last` and `left`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` again to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum up to `i` minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` where the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It updates `inx` to the minimum of `inx` and `last[i-1]`.
     - If `inx` is valid (not less than 0), it sets `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - After calling `func_2` with the original list and the reversed list, the program combines the results to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - If either `ans[i]` or `ans2[i]` is -1, it sets `ans[i]` to the maximum of the two (which will be -1 if one of them is -1).
   - Otherwise, it sets `ans[i]` to the minimum of the two.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no slime can be eaten by another slime correctly by setting the result to -1.
   - It also handles the case where the list `a` is reversed to consider the possibility of slimes being eaten from both directions.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or reporting that it is impossible. The use of cumulative sums and the `bisect_left` function helps in efficiently finding the required indices.

However, there is a potential issue in the way `left` is updated. The cumulative sum should be calculated correctly, but the current implementation might not handle the edge cases where the cumulative sum is zero or negative.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or reports that it is impossible.
