Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` which has been updated for all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) based on the conditions specified. For each index `i` in the range 1 to \(n-1\), if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the index found by `func_1(left, x)` and `inx2` is `last[i-1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, `inx` is updated to `inx2`. If `inx` is less than 0, the update is skipped. The final value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `a`, `left`, and `last`.**
