Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where a slime can eat its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. Specifically, the program does not consider the possibility of a slime being eaten by a neighbor to its right. The logic only checks for the left neighbor and does not account for the right neighbor, which can lead to incorrect results.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
5
2 2 3 1 4

Expected Output:
2 1 -1 1 2

Actual Output:
2 1 -1 1 -1
```

In this example, the 5th slime (with size 4) can be eaten by the 3rd slime (with size 3) after the 3rd slime eats the 4th slime (with size 1). However, the program incorrectly outputs -1 for the 5th slime, indicating that it is impossible for the 5th slime to be eaten, which is not true according to the problem description.
