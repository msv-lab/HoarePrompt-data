Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a) and n must be greater than 1. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. `last` is a list containing the integers -1 and 1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1. `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the value of `a[i - 1]`.**
