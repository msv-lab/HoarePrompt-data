The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `res`. If `res` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element of `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of `res`.

State: **`res` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `res`**
