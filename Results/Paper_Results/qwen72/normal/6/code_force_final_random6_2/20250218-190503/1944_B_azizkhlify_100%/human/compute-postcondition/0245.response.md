Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1.
- If `ul` is `k * 2`, then `ur` is 0, `re` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ul`, `ur`, and `re` remain 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is read from the input, so its exact values are not known. However, we know that `a` contains integers.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since `i` is 1, the print statement will print the value at index 1 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

### Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
