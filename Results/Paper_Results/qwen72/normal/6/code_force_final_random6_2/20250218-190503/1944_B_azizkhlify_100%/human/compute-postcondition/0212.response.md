Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list, and the loop has printed all elements of `res` separated by spaces. If `ul` and `ur` are not equal, and `n` is greater than 0, then `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 for any `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, then `ur` is updated to `ur + 2` for each such `i`, and the corresponding elements in `r` are set to 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur` at any point, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
