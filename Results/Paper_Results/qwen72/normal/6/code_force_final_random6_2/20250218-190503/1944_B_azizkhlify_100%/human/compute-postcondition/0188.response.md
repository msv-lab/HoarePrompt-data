The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range defined by `n` and `2 * n`. To ensure the loop can execute, the range must have at least one value. This means that `2 * n` must be greater than `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `res` being a non-empty list and `ul` and `ur` not being equal are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

State: **`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**
