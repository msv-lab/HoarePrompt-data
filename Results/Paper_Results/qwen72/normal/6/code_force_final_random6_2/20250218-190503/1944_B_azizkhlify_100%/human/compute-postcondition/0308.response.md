Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` is 0 or 2, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it is reset to 0, and `ur` is updated to 2 or 4. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.***
