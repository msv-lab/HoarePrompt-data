Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is `n + 1`.
3. `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged.
4. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is defined as `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 1 (if `n` is 1, `i` will be 2, and so on).

2. **Determine the value of `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact values of the list `a`. Therefore, we can only describe `a[i]` in terms of its position in the list.

3. **Determine the output of the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the position `i` in the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 1)**
