The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1, and the conditions for updating `ur` and `r` are still pending based on the values in `a` and `r`.**
