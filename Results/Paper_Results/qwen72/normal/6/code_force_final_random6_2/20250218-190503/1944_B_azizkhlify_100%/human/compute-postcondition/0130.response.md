Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - Since `i` is 0, the statement is printing `a[0]` twice.
   - The value of `a[0]` is not explicitly given, but we know that `a[0] - 1` is the index of an element in the list `l` and that element is 2. This implies that `a[0]` must be 1 because `a[0] - 1` is 0, and `l[0]` is 2.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[0]` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since `a[0]` is 1, the output will be `1 1 `.

Output: **1 1**
