Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing the elements of `a` (from the first `n` elements) for which `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, up to the point where `re` equals `k` if `k` is not zero. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is the index at which the loop broke or `n` if the loop completed without breaking, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, and if `k` is zero, `res` remains an empty list.**
