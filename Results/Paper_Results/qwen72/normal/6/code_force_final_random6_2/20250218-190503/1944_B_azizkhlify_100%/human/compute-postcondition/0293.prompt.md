Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing the elements of `a` (from the first `n` elements) for which `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, up to the point where `re` equals `k` if `k` is not zero. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is the index at which the loop broke or `n` if the loop completed without breaking, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, and if `k` is zero, `res` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is the next element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is the next element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
