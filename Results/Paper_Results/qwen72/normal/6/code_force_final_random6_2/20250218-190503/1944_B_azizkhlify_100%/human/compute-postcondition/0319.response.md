Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last index where the loop executed or broke, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the `n` to `2 * n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `r` and were reset to 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the loop completes all iterations. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
