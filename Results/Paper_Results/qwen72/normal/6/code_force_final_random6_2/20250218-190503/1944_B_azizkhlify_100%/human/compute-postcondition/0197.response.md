The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition that `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `res` is a non-empty list.
- `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same, and the loop condition `i < 2 * n` must still be true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`**
