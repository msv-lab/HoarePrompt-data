The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` should be `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to `n + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
