To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components of the statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by user input with constraints:
     - 1 ≤ n ≤ 26
     - 1 ≤ k ≤ 26
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (though `t` is not used in the `print` statement).
   - `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is a set that may or may not contain `i` from the previous iteration.
   - `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`.
   - `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
   - `i` is the next element in `us` that is not in `win`, and `us` must still have elements that have not been iterated over.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ans` is a list of characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`.
   - `i` is the next element in `us` that is not in `win`.
   - `n - len(ans) - 1` calculates the number of 'a' characters to append to the string formed by joining `ans` and `i`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - `''join(ans)` converts the list `ans` into a string by joining its elements.
   - `i` is a single character from the set `us` that is not in `win`.
   - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` appends `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to the string.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The string formed by joining `ans`, `i`, and the appropriate number of 'a' characters is printed.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the output will be a string that starts with the characters in `ans`, followed by the next character `i` from `us` that is not in `win`, and then padded with 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.

Output: **[characters in ans][next character i from us not in win]a * (n - len(ans) - 1) (where [characters in ans] is the string formed by joining the elements of the list ans, [next character i from us not in win] is the next character in us that is not in win, and a * (n - len(ans) - 1) is the string of 'a' characters needed to make the total length of the output string equal to n)**
