Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads user input to determine `n`, `k`, and `m` (integers), and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters. If the number of such sequences reaches `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` sequences are found, the function prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` alphabets that was not part of the last sequence, it prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by the missing character, and padded with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`. **
