Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each character in the string `s`.
- For each character `i` in `s`, if `i` is in the set `us` (which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets), the character is added to the set `win`.
- If `win` reaches a size of `k` (i.e., it contains all `k` unique characters), the character `i` is added to the list `ans`, and `win` is cleared.
- The variable `ps` is incremented each time `win` reaches a size of `k` and is cleared.
- After the loop finishes, `win` is guaranteed to be an empty set because it is cleared every time it reaches a size of `k`.
- The list `ans` contains all the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then be cleared.
- The variable `ps` holds the count of how many times `win` was cleared, which is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` during the loop execution.
