Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set that may or may not contain `i` from the previous iteration, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, `i` is the next element in `us` that is not in `win`, and `us` must still have elements that have not been iterated over.***
