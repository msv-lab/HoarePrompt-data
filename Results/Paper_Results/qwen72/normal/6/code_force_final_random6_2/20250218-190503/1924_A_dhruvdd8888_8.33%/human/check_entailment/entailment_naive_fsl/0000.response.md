Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.

### Case When the Program Does Not Work Correctly:
Consider the input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`
- `s = "aabbccabab"`

The program should check if all possible strings of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (i.e., 'a', 'b', 'c') occur as a subsequence in `s`. The possible strings are:
- "aaa", "aab", "aac", "aba", "abb", "abc", "aca", "acb", "acc", "baa", "bab", "bac", "bba", "bbb", "bbc", "bca", "bcb", "bcc", "caa", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbb", "cbc", "cca", "ccb", "ccc".

However, the program does not generate and check all these possible strings. Instead, it only checks if the window `win` contains all `k` characters and then appends the current character to `ans` if the condition is met. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked.

For example, the string "ccc" does not occur as a subsequence in `s`, but the program does not correctly identify this and prints "NO" followed by an incorrect string.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
