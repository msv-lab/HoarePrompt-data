Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string, which must have at least one character. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `i` is the second character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is a set that now contains the second character in `s`. `ans` and `ps` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
