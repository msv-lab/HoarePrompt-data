Output State: **The program prints 'YES' and returns None.** 

In this output state, the program prints the string 'YES' to the console and, since the `print` function returns `None`, the overall return value of the program is `None`. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
