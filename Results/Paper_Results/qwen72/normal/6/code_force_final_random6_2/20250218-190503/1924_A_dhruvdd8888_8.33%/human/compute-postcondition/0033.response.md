Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects are defined as follows:

- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by user input, with constraints:
  - 1 ≤ n ≤ 26
  - 1 ≤ k ≤ 26
  - 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
- `s` is a string of length m, initially comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, but it is updated to the user input string.
- `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`.
- `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'NO'. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **NO**
