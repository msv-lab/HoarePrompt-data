The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second character of `s`, and `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the third character of `s`, and `s` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing the first and second characters of `s`**
