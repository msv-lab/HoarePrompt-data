You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is the last character of the last processed string `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed and must not be empty, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the last processed string `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, then `newstr` and `isreverse` remain as defined in the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If so, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of `s` that is either the second half concatenated with the first half, the reversed string, or a combination of both, ensuring the output is different from the original string `s`. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and strips any leading or trailing spaces.

2. **Set Creation**:
   - The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - This is done to check if the string contains more than one unique character.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character (`len(a) > 1`), it means the string can be rearranged to form a different string.
   - If the set `a` has only one unique character (`len(a) == 1`), it means the string cannot be rearranged to form a different string, and the program prints "NO".

4. **Rearrangement**:
   - If the string can be rearranged, the program attempts to create a new string `newstr` by splitting the string `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
   - It checks if `newstr` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `newstr`.
   - If `newstr` is the same as `s`, it tries to reverse the string `s` and checks if the reversed string `isreverse` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `isreverse`.
   - If both `newstr` and `isreverse` are the same as `s`, it creates another rearrangement by taking the second half of the string and concatenating it with the first half (excluding the last character of the first half).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string if a valid rearrangement is found.
   - It prints "NO" if no valid rearrangement is possible.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Set Check**:
  - The set check `len(a) > 1` is correct. If the string has more than one unique character, it can be rearranged to form a different string.

- **Rearrangement Logic**:
  - The logic to create `newstr` by splitting the string into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order is a valid approach to create a different string.
  - The logic to reverse the string `s` and check if it is different from `s` is also correct.
  - The final fallback logic to create another rearrangement by taking the second half and concatenating it with the first half (excluding the last character of the first half) is also a valid approach to ensure the string is different.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles strings of length 1 by printing "NO" because a string of length 1 cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
  - The program also handles strings of length 2 and longer by attempting different rearrangements to ensure the output string is different from the input string.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the given requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
