Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If so, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of `s` that is either the second half concatenated with the first half, the reversed string, or a combination of both, ensuring the output is different from the original string `s`. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. **
