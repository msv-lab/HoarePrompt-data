Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, stripped of any leading or trailing spaces, and each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, and `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, `newstr` is the concatenation of the second half of `s` (starting from the middle index) and the first half of `s` (up to the middle index), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is either not equal to `s` or equal to `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character in `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in `s`. If the number of unique characters in `s` is greater than 1 and `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed version of `s`. If the number of unique characters in `s` is greater than 1 and `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains the reversed version of `s` if it is not equal to `s`, and remains equal to `s` if it is equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, `newstr` and `isreverse` are not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed and must not be empty, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, then `newstr` and `isreverse` remain as defined in the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
