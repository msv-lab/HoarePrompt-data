Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` plus the value of `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and the value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and the value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mod_x = -num % x` updates the value of `mod_x` to be the result of `-num % x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- `mod_x` is now the value of `-num % x`, which is a specific value based on the current values of `num` and `x`.
- `mod_y` remains the value of `num % y`.
- `mod_x_key` remains the value of `num % x`.
- `mod_y_key` remains the value of `num % y`.
