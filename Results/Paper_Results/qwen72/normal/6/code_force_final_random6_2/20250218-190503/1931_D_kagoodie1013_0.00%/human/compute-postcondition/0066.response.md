Output State: **`test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mod_x = -num % x` calculates the value of `-num % x` and assigns it to `mod_x`.
- `num` is the first element of `arr`.
- `x` is the second element of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` which is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged.
- `mod_x` is now equal to `-num % x`.
