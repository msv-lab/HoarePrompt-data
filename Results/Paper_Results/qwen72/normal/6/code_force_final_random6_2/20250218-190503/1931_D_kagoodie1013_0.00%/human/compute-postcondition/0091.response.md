Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `results` list contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`, where each element is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple. Each `count` value is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the respective `arr`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each tuple are no longer empty and contain keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` and `num % y` for each `num` in the respective `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears. The `num` variable is the last element of the `arr` for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x` for this `num`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y` for this `num`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x` for this `num`, and `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y` for this `num`.**
