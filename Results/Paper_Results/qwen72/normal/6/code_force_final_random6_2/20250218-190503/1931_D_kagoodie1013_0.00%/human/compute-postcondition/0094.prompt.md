You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `results` list contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`, where each element is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple. Each `count` value is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the respective `arr`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each tuple are no longer empty and contain keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` and `num % y` for each `num` in the respective `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears. The `num` variable is the last element of the `arr` for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x` for this `num`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y` for this `num`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x` for this `num`, and `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y` for this `num`.
    return results
    #The program returns the `results` list, which contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple, where `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the respective `arr`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each tuple contain keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` and `num % y` for each `num` in the respective `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element is the sum of counts of remainders when each integer in `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, for each tuple in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `results` list, which contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple, where `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the respective `arr`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each tuple contain keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` and `num % y` for each `num` in the respective `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
