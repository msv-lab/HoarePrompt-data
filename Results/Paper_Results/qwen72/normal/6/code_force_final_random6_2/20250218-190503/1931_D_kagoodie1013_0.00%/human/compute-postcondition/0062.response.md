Output State: **The `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, the `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`. `count` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `count = 0` resets the value of `count` to 0. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
