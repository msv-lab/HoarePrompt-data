Output State: **`test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`, `count` is now the sum of the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, 2, and 2, `mod_x_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value 3, `mod_y_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 2, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is updated to `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` by incrementing it by 1.
- Initially, `mod_x_map` contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value 2.
- After executing the code, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented to 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
