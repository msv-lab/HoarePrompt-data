Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the list and the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

3. **Loop through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It then adds the counts of elements that have the same remainders as `mod_x` and `mod_y` to the `count`.
   - This step is intended to count pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Updating Dictionaries**:
   - The program updates `mod_x_map` with the key `num % x` and `mod_y_map` with the key `num % y`.
   - This is done to keep track of the remainders of the elements as they are processed.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, which are the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the way the program counts the pairs:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `mod_x`**:
  - The program calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`, which is not the correct way to determine if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - The correct way to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` is to use the remainders of `a_i` and `a_j` when divided by `x`. Specifically, for a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to be divisible by `x`, the sum of their remainders should be zero or `x`.

- **Incorrect Pair Counting**:
  - The program adds the counts of elements that have the same remainders as `mod_x` and `mod_y` to the `count`.
  - This approach does not correctly count pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

To fix the program, we need to correctly count pairs where both conditions are met. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This version iterates through all pairs \((i, j)\) and checks both conditions directly.

Correctness: **False**  
The original program does not correctly count the beautiful pairs due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x` and the incorrect method of counting pairs.
