The only objects in the loop head are `test_cases`, `(n, x, y, arr)`. So we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 2 tuples, the loop can execute again for the second tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 tuple, and `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 2 tuples, and `(n, x, y, arr)` will be the second tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys representing the unique remainders of `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.**
