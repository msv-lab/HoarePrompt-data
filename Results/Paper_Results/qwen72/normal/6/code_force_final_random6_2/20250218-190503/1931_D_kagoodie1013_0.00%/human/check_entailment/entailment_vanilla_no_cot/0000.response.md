Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided program is flawed. Specifically, the way it counts the beautiful pairs is incorrect. The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. However, the conditions for a pair to be beautiful are more complex and cannot be accurately captured by simply adding the counts of elements with the same remainders.

The correct approach should involve checking each pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to see if both conditions are satisfied:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and checks both conditions for each pair. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the count. This approach ensures that all beautiful pairs are correctly identified.
