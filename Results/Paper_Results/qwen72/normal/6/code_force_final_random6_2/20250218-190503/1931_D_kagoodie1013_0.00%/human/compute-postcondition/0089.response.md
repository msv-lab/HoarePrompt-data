Output State: **The `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`, `count` is now the sum of the final value of `count` before the execution of the code and the accumulated values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each element in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains keys corresponding to the unique values of `num % x` for each element in `arr`, with values equal to the number of occurrences of each unique `num % x` value, `mod_y_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains keys corresponding to the unique values of `num % y` for each element in `arr`, with values equal to the number of occurrences of each unique `num % y` value, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` where `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` where `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` where `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` where `num` is the last element of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `arr` list must have at least `n` elements.
- The `results` list still contains the initial value of `count` repeated twice.
- The `count` variable is updated to the sum of the initial value of `count` and the accumulated values from the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each element in `arr`.
- The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains the counts of each unique `num % x` value for all elements in `arr`.
- The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains the counts of each unique `num % y` value for all elements in `arr`.
- The `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` variables are set based on the last element of `arr`.
