Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. The value of `num` is the first element in `arr`, and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
