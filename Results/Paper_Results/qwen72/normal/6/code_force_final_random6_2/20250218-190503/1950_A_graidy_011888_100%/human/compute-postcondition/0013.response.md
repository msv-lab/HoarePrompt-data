Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` is true. If `a < b` and `b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` is true. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c` are still valid, but their truth values depend on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided by the user input.
