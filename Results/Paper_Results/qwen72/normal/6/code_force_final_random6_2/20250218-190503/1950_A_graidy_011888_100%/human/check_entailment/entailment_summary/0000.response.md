Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It reads the number of test cases, `n`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a "stair" and a "peak" and prints the appropriate result. The conditions are:

- A "stair" is when `a < b < c`.
- A "peak" is when `a < b` and `b > c`.

If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and the example provided.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
