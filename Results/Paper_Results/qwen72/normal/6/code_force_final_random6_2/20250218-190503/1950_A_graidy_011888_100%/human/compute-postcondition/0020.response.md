Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true. If `a < b` and `b > c`, the condition `a < b and b > c` is true. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to integers provided by the user input. The initial state remains valid for `t`, `n`, and `i`, and the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c` are still applicable based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
