### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which is appropriate for splitting the input line and converting the values to integers.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by using the condition `a < b < c`. This condition is correct according to the problem description.
   - It checks if the digits form a peak by using the condition `a < b and b > c`. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.

3. **Output:**
   - If the condition `a < b < c` is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition `a < b and b > c` is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE". This is the correct behavior for all other cases, including when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same, or when they do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should output "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are in different orders, such as `3 4 1` (which should output "PEAK"), and other combinations that do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The conditions used in the program are logically sound and match the problem description.
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case as required.
   - The output for each test case is correctly formatted and matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
