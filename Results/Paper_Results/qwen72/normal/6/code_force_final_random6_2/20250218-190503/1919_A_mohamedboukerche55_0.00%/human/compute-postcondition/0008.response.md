The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `s` is the new input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the new `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new `s`**
