Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(a, b):
```

With the updated function definition, the precondition remains:

Precondition: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.**
