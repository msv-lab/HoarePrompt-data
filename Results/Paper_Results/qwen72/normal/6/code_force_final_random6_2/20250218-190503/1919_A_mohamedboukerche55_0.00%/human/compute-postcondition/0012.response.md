Output State: **`i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus one (since the loop starts at 0). The value of `int(input())` must have been at least as large as the number of iterations for the loop to complete. The variable `s` will hold the last input string that was processed, and `a` and `b` will hold the integer values of the first and second words in this last input string, respectively.
