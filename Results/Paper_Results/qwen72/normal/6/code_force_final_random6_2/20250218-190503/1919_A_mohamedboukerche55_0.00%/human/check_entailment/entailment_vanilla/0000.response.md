Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. However, it reads the input for each test case as a single string and splits it to get the values of `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The key to solving this problem is understanding the game dynamics. The game is essentially a turn-based game where each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, it means that both players will always have the same number of moves available to them. This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, and if the total starts even, it will remain even after each move. Therefore, the game will end in a draw or Bob will have the last move, making Bob the winner.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, it means that the total number of moves available is odd. This means that Alice will have the last move, making Alice the winner.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "bob" and "alice" with an extra space at the end. This is incorrect according to the problem statement, which requires the output to be exactly "Bob" or "Alice" without any extra spaces.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b` is correct.
   - However, the output format is incorrect, which would cause the program to fail in a real-world scenario where strict output formatting is required.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct but fails due to the incorrect output format.

Correctness: **False**
