Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `T` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, and `i` is `T - 1`. For each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are the same integers provided by the user input. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are different integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, it remains 1, and if `b` is 1, `a` is not equal to `b`. If `b` is not 1, then `a` is not equal to `b` and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is odd, then `a` is an odd integer. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `a` is even and `b` is odd. If `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 1000.
- The variable `T` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed.
- The loop index `i` is one less than `T` (i.e., `i` is `T - 1`).
- For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are provided by the user input, and their relationships and conditions (whether they are equal, if `a` is 1, if `b` is 1, if `a` is odd, if `a` is even and `b` is odd, if `a` > `b`, or if `a` ≤ `b`) are determined based on the input values and the conditions in the loop body. These conditions are checked and the corresponding output ('Alice' or 'Bob') is printed for each iteration.
