The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The precondition provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Alice**
