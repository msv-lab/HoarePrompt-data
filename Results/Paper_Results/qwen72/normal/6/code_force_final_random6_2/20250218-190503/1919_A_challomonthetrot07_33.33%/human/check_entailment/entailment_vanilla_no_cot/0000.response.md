Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here is why:

1. **Initial Conditions and Even/Odd Analysis**:
   - If `a == b`, the game is symmetric, and the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because she will be forced to make the first move, which will eventually lead to a situation where she cannot make a move. This is correctly handled.
   - If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the player with 1 coin will always lose because they will be forced to remove the last coin and then cannot make a move. This is correctly handled.
   - The program incorrectly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are both even or both odd. The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of `a` and `b` is flawed.

2. **Correct Logic**:
   - The game can be analyzed based on the parity of the number of coins. If both `a` and `b` are even, the player who starts (Alice) will always win because she can always force the game into a state where Bob is left with an odd number of coins, and eventually, Bob will be forced to remove the last coin.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because she will be forced to make the first move, which will eventually lead to a situation where she cannot make a move.

3. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if `a` is odd, Bob will always win. This is not true if `b` is also odd.
   - The program also incorrectly assumes that if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice will always win. This is not true if `a` is 2 and `b` is 1, for example.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected version correctly handles the parity of `a` and `b` and ensures that the game is analyzed correctly based on the rules provided.
