Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are the same integers provided by the user input. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are different integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, it remains 1. If `a` is not 1, it is not equal to 1. If `b` is 1, `a` is not equal to `b`. If `b` is not 1, `a` is not equal to `b` and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `a` is even and `b` is odd. Otherwise, if `a` is odd, then `a` is an odd integer. If `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
