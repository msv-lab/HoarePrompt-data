Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, and `a` is not equal to `b`. Additionally, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `a` is even and `b` is odd. Otherwise, either `a` is not even, or `b` is not odd, and if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
