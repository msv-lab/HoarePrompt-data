Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `cd` is 1, `i` is 0, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `nums` is 1.**

The value of `cd` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
