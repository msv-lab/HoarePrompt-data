Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the number of distinct integers in a set. It then reads a line of input, splits it into a set of strings, converts them to integers, and sorts the resulting list. If the length of the sorted list `nums` is 1, it prints 'Alice'. If the length is 2, it prints 'Bob'. For lengths greater than 2, it inserts a 0 at the beginning of `nums` and checks for consecutive integers starting from the second element. If the number of consecutive integers (excluding the first 0) is odd, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. In all cases, the function returns `None`. **
