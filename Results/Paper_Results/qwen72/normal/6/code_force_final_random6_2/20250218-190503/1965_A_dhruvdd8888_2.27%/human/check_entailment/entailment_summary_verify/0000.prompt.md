You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

    if len(nums) == 1:

    if len(nums) == 2:
        return print('Bob')
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
    if cd & 1:
        return print('Bob')
    else:
        return print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the number of distinct integers in a set. It then reads a line of input, splits it into a set of strings, converts them to integers, and sorts the resulting list. If the length of the sorted list `nums` is 1, it prints 'Alice'. If the length is 2, it prints 'Bob'. For lengths greater than 2, it inserts a 0 at the beginning of `nums` and checks for consecutive integers starting from the second element. If the number of consecutive integers (excluding the first 0) is odd, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. In all cases, the function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the game outcome can be determined solely by the number of unique pile sizes and the difference between consecutive pile sizes. However, the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest size, not just the unique pile sizes.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 2
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, removing 1 stone from each pile, leaving the piles as \( 0, 1, 1 \). Bob will then be forced to choose \( k = 1 \) again, leaving the piles as \( 0, 0, 0 \), and Alice wins.

However, the program will output "Bob" because it incorrectly processes the input and does not correctly determine the game outcome based on the rules provided. The program should instead focus on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest size to determine the winner.
