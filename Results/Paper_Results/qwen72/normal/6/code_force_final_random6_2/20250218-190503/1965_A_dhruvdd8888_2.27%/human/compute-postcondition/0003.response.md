Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is now a sorted list of integers, and the current length of `nums` is 1.**
