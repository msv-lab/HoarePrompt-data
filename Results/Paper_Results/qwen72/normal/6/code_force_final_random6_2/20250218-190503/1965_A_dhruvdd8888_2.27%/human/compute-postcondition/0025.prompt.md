Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is now a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3. `cd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
    if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
        cd += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 0. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `nums` is 1, then `cd` is 1. Otherwise, `cd` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `nums` is 1, `cd` is set to 2. Otherwise, `cd` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is 3 or 1 depending on the previous condition. Otherwise, `cd` is 2 or 0 depending on the previous condition, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
