Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1`, then `cd` is 3 or 1 depending on the previous condition. Otherwise, `cd` is 2 or 0 depending on the previous condition, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
