The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The length of `nums` remains the same, so it must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `cd` is 1 if the difference between the second element and the first element of `nums` is 1, otherwise `cd` is 0**
