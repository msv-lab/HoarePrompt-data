The function definition provided is incomplete. However, based on the problem description, the function should likely take the number of test cases and the piles of stones as inputs. Here is a more appropriate function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of test_cases is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
