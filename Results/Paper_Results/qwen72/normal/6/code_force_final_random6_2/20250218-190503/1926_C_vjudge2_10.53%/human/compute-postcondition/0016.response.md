Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `values[0]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the first element of the `values` list (since `i` is 0).
- Since `i` is 0, `values[0]` is now 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
