Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`.**

The code snippet `sum_values[i] = sum_total` updates the value at index `i` (which is 10) in the `sum_values` list to the value of `sum_total`. The value of `sum_total` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
