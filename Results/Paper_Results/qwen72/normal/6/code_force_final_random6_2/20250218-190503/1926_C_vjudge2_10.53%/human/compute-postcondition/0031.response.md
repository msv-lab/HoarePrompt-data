Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1.**

The code snippet `remainder = int(word[:-1])` converts the string `word` to an integer, excluding the last character. Since `word` is '10', `word[:-1]` is '1', and `int('1')` is 1. Therefore, `remainder` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
