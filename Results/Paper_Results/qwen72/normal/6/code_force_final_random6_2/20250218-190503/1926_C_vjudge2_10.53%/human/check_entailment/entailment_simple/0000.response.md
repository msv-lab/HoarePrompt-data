### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` into a list called `numbers`.
   - This part of the code is correct and adheres to the problem's input format.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number from 0 to the maximum `n` in the `numbers` list.
   - The initial values for the first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values` are correctly set. This is necessary because the sum of digits for single-digit numbers is the number itself.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - The code iterates from 10 to `n` and calculates the sum of digits for each number.
   - The sum of digits for a number `i` is calculated by splitting the number into its last digit and the remainder (all digits except the last one).
   - The sum of digits for `i` is then computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - This is a correct approach to calculate the sum of digits for a number.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum of the values in `values` is stored in `sum_values`.
   - This is done by adding the current value in `values` to the cumulative sum of the previous value in `sum_values`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each `n` in the `numbers` list, the function prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits up to `n` from the `sum_values` list.
   - This is the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `n` is less than 10 correctly by initializing the first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values`.

7. **Performance:**
   - The code has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for the worst case, where `n` is the maximum number in the `numbers` list.
   - Given the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the code should be efficient enough to run within the 0.5 seconds time limit.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and adheres to the constraints and input/output format specified. The reasoning and steps are sound, and the code should produce the correct output for the given test cases.
