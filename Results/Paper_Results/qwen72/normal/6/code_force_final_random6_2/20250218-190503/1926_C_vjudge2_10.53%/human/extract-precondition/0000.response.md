Precondition: **The function should take an integer t and a list of integers n, where 1 <= t <= 10^4 and for each n, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and a list of integers for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and n_list is a list of t integers where each integer n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**
