Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of integers to be processed. It then reads `t` integers from user input and stores them in a list `numbers`. The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` (if `numbers` is not empty) to store specific integer values and their cumulative sums, respectively. The first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values` are set to the integers 0 through 9 and their cumulative sums, respectively. For each integer `i` from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers`, the function calculates the value at index `i` in `values` as the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits. The cumulative sum up to `i` is stored in `sum_values`. Finally, the function prints the cumulative sum for each integer in `numbers`. The function does not return any value. **
