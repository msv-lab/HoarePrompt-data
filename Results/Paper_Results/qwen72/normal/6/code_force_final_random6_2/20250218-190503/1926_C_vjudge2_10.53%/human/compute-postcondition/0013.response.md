Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains 0.
- The variable `numbers` remains a list containing `t` input integers.
- The variable `n` remains the last input integer.
- The variable `values` remains a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list.
- The new variable `sum_values` is created and assigned a list of zeros with the same length as `values`, which is `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list.
