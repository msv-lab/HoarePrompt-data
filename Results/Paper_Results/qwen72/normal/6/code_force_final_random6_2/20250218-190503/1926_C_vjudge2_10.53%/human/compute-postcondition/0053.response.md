To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum_values[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 45.
   - `i` is the second input integer from the `numbers` list.
   - `n` is the second input integer from the `numbers` list.
   - `values` is a list of integers.
   - `sum_values` is a list of integers.
   - `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `total` is explicitly given as 45.
   - `i` and `n` are both the second element of the `numbers` list. This means `i` and `n` are the same integer.
   - `values` is a list of integers, but its specific values are not provided.
   - `sum_values` is a list of integers, but its specific values are not provided.
   - `numbers` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `n` is the second element of this list.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(sum_values[n])` will print the value at index `n` in the list `sum_values`.
   - Since `n` is the second element of the `numbers` list, the exact value of `n` is not known without the specific `numbers` list.
   - Similarly, the exact value of `sum_values[n]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in `sum_values`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is the second element of the `numbers` list and `sum_values` is a list of integers)**
