The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 11, `n` is greater than or equal to 11. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 12, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 12.

State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `values[11]` is `values[1] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`, `sum_values[11]` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`, `sum_total` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`**
