Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers, storing them in the list `numbers`. This part of the function is correct.

2. **Initialization of `values` and `sum_values`**:
   - The function initializes `values` and `sum_values` as lists of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`. This is appropriate because it ensures that the lists can store the sum of digits and cumulative sums for all integers from 0 to the maximum value in `numbers`.
   - The first 10 elements of `values` are correctly set to the integers 0 through 9, and `sum_values` is correctly set to the cumulative sums of these values. This is necessary because the sum of digits for numbers 0 through 9 is the number itself.

3. **Calculation of `values` and `sum_values` for numbers greater than 9**:
   - The function iterates from 10 to `n + 1` (where `n` is the maximum value in `numbers`), calculating the sum of digits for each number `i`.
   - It splits the number `i` into its last digit and the remainder (all digits except the last one). This is done using string manipulation, which is a valid approach.
   - The sum of digits for `i` is then calculated as the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i`. This is correct because the sum of digits of a number can be broken down into the sum of its last digit and the sum of the digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum is correctly updated in `sum_values` for each `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the cumulative sum for each integer in `numbers` by accessing the corresponding value in `sum_values`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `t` is 1 and `n` is 1, 2, 3, etc., correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` is 10, 11, 12, etc., correctly by using the precomputed values and cumulative sums.

6. **Performance**:
   - The function should be efficient enough to handle the upper limit of `n` (2 * 10^5) within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation of `values` and `sum_values` up to the maximum `n` ensures that the actual sum calculation for each test case is done in constant time.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
