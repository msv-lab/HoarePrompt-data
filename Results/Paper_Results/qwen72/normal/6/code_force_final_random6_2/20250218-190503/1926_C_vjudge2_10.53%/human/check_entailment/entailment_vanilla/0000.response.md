Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case. It stores these values in the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization**: Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. The size of these lists is `max(numbers) + 1` to ensure they can hold values for the largest `n` in the test cases.

3. **Sum of Digits for Numbers 1 to 9**: The function correctly initializes the first 10 values in the `values` list, which are the numbers themselves since they are single-digit numbers. It also calculates the cumulative sum for these values and stores them in `sum_values`.

4. **Sum of Digits for Numbers 10 and Above**: The function iterates from 10 to `max(numbers) + 1` and calculates the sum of digits for each number. It does this by converting the number to a string, extracting the last digit and the remainder of the number (all digits except the last one), and using the precomputed values to find the sum of digits. This approach is efficient and avoids recalculating the sum of digits for each number from scratch.

5. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: For each number `i` from 10 to `max(numbers) + 1`, the function updates the cumulative sum in `sum_values` by adding the current sum of digits to the previous cumulative sum.

6. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list, which is the sum of the numbers on the board after the replacement process.

7. **Efficiency**: The function precomputes the sum of digits and cumulative sums up to the largest `n` in the test cases, which ensures that the output for each test case can be generated in constant time. This is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, especially when `t` can be as large as \(10^4\) and `n` can be as large as \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

8. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1, 2, 3, etc., where the sum of digits is simply the number itself.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
