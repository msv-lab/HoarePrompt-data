You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the final state includes `i` being the length of `l` minus 1, `k` being the initial `k` minus the sum of the counts of all strings in `l` that are not equal to `fav` and minus the count of `fav` if `fav` is in `l`. The loop will have printed 'NO' if `k` became less than or equal to 0 before reaching `fav` in the list `l`, 'MAYBE' if `k` became less than 0 when `fav` was encountered, and 'YES' if `k` was greater than or equal to 0 when `fav` was encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads `t` test cases from the user. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers. It then checks if the `f`-th element in the sorted list of integers (in descending order) can be included in the top `k` elements based on their frequency. If `k` equals `n`, it prints 'YES'. If the `f`-th element is not among the top `k` elements, it prints 'NO'. If the `f`-th element is among the top `k` elements but the remaining elements have a combined frequency that exceeds `k`, it prints 'MAYBE'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function ends.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the removal of cubes. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program counts the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube and how it determines if the favorite cube is removed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
MAYBE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- The favorite cube is the second cube with a value of 3.
- After sorting the cubes in non-increasing order, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
- In the first possible sorted list, the favorite cube is in the second position and will be removed.
- In the second possible sorted list, the favorite cube is in the third position and will not be removed.
- Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" in this case.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube could be in multiple positions after sorting, leading to incorrect results.
