Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'NO'`.
- The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The initial state provides information about these variables, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
