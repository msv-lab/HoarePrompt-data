Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order, and it must have at least 3 elements.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `i`, `l`, and `k`.

Output: **NO**
