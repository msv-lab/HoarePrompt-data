Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements. If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]` and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
