Output State: **`i` is the length of `l`, `k` is the third integer in `b`, `t` is greater than the length of `l`, `b` is a list of integers derived from the substrings of `a` separated by whitespace, `o` is a list of strings derived from the input split by whitespace, `n` is the first integer in `b`, `f` is the second integer in `b`, `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in `o`. If `k` is equal to `n`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
