Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it only attempts to split the first out-of-order element it encounters in each test case, and it does not consider the possibility of needing to split multiple elements or the impact of splitting elements on the order of the array. Additionally, the function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted after potentially splitting one element, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Single Split Operation**: The program only performs a single split operation when it finds the first element that is out of order. However, the problem allows for multiple operations to be performed, and the program should check if the array can be sorted by performing any number of these operations.

2. **Incorrect Split Logic**: The program splits the out-of-order element and inserts the digits in the same position, but it does not re-evaluate the array after the split to see if more elements need to be split or if the array is now sorted.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted after potentially performing one split operation. This is not enough to determine if the array can be sorted through multiple operations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the splitting operations and check if the array can be sorted after performing all necessary splits. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Simulate the splitting process
    new_a = []
    for num in a:
        if num >= 10:
            new_a.extend([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
        else:
            new_a.append(num)
    
    # Check if the new array is sorted
    return new_a == sorted(new_a)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version of the program:
1. Splits each element in the array that is at least 10 into its digits.
2. Checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This approach ensures that all necessary splits are performed and the array is correctly checked for sorting.
