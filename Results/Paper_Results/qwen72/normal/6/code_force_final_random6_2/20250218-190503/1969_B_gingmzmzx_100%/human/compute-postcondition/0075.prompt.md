You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the binary string and possibly the number of test cases. A corrected function definition might look like: `def min_cost_sort(s, t=1):` where `s` is a binary string and `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the total cost of sorting the binary string `s` such that all zeros come before all ones.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It should return the minimum cost required to sort the binary string `s` in non-decreasing order. If the function is called with invalid parameters, it should handle such cases appropriately.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
