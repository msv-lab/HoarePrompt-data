Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with the `c`-th element incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the first element of `s`, `cnt[c]` is updated to `cnt[c] + 1`.
- The rest of the variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The list `cnt` is updated, but only the element at the index `c` is incremented by 1. The other elements of `cnt` remain 0.
