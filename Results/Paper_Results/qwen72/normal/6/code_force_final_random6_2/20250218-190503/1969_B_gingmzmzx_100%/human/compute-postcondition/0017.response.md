Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and has at least two elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1. If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1)`.***
