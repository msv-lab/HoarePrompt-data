### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring `s_l s_{l+1} ... s_r` moves the last character of the substring to the front and shifts all other characters one position to the right.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring `r - l + 1`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is `0`, it increments the count of zeroes in `cnt` and adds 1 to the answer `ans` if there is at least one `1` before it.
     - If `c` is `1`, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeroes to the answer `ans`.

4. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The logic is based on the idea that to sort the string, we need to move all `1`s to the right of all `0`s.
   - For each `0` encountered, if there is at least one `1` before it, we need to perform a cyclic shift to move the `1` to the right of the `0`.
   - For each `1` encountered, we need to move all remaining `0`s to the left of the `1` to sort the string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., `0000`).
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple shifts to sort (e.g., `101011`).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function Definition:**
  - The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which is not ideal but does not affect the correctness of the program since it reads input directly within the function.
  - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.

- **State of the Program:**
  - The state annotations are mostly correct:
    - `n` is the number of test cases.
    - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string.
    - `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`.
    - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros encountered so far and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones encountered so far.
    - `ans` is the total cost of sorting the binary string `s`.

- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - The algorithm correctly counts the number of zeroes and ones.
  - It correctly calculates the cost by iterating through the string once:
    - For each `0`, it adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one `1` before it.
    - For each `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans`.

### Final Evaluation:

- The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
- The algorithm efficiently calculates the cost by iterating through the string once, making it suitable for the given constraints.
- The program handles edge cases correctly and produces the expected output for the provided examples.

Final: **True**
