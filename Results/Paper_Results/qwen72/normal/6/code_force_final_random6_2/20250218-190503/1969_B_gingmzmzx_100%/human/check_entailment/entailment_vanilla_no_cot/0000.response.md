Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` using `s.count(0)` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost of the operations.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` past the `1`.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining `0`s that need to be moved past this `1` to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, it prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

The logic of the program is based on the observation that the cost of sorting the string can be calculated by counting the number of `0`s that need to be moved past `1`s to achieve a sorted order. This is done efficiently by keeping a running count of `0`s and `1`s and updating the cost accordingly.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
