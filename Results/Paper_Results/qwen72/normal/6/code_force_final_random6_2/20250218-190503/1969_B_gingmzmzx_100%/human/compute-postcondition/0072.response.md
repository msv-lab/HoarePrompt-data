Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string.
   - `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where:
     - `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s`.
     - `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the number of ones in `s` for each zero in `s` plus the sum of the number of zeros in `s` for each one in `s`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `ans`:**
   - For each zero in `s`, the number of ones in `s` is added to `ans`.
   - For each one in `s`, the number of zeros in `s` is added to `ans`.

3. **Formulating the Calculation:**
   - Let `zeroes` be the number of zeros in `s`.
   - Let `ones` be the number of ones in `s`.
   - The contribution of zeros to `ans` is `zeroes * ones`.
   - The contribution of ones to `ans` is `ones * zeroes`.
   - Therefore, `ans = zeroes * ones + ones * zeroes = 2 * zeroes * ones`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is `2 * zeroes * ones`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `zeroes` and `ones` from the initial state, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * zeroes * ones (where zeroes is the number of zeros in the list `s` and ones is the number of ones in the list `s`)**
