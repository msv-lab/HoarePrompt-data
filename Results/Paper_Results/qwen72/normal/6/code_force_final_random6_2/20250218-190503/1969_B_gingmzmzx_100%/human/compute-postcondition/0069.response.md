Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if the first element of `s` is 1, otherwise `cnt[first element of s]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 2, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0, or `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1` if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.**
