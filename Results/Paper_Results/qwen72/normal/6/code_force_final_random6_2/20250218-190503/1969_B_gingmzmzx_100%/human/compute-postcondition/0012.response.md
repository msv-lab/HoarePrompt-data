Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and has at least one element, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1`, and `c` is the first element of `s`.***
