The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The function definition and its parameters do not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be modified in this context.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
