To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of an input string.
- `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where:
  - `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` (which is `zeroes`).
  - `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the product of the number of ones in `s` and the number of zeros in `s` minus the number of zeros encountered so far.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The number of zeros in `s` is `zeroes`.
- The number of ones in `s` is `cnt[1]`.
- The number of zeros encountered so far is `zeroes` (since `zeroes` is the total number of zeros in the list `s`).

The formula for `ans` is:
\[ \text{ans} = \text{zeroes} + (\text{cnt[1]} \times \text{zeroes}) - \text{zeroes} \]

Simplifying the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = \text{zeroes} + (\text{cnt[1]} \times \text{zeroes}) - \text{zeroes} \]
\[ \text{ans} = \text{cnt[1]} \times \text{zeroes} \]

### Explanation:
- `zeroes` is the total number of zeros in the list `s`.
- `cnt[1]` is the total number of ones in the list `s`.
- The final value of `ans` is the product of the number of ones and the number of zeros in the list `s`.

### Output:
Output: **cnt[1] * zeroes (where cnt[1] is the number of ones in the list s and zeroes is the number of zeros in the list s)**
