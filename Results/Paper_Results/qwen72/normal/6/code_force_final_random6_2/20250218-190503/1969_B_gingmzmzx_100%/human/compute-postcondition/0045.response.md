Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string with at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is [1, 1], `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], and `ans` is initially 0. So, `ans` becomes `0 + (zeroes - 2)`, which simplifies to `zeroes - 2`.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [1, 1], and `ans` is initially `zeroes - 1`. So, `ans` becomes `(zeroes - 1) + (zeroes - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * (zeroes - 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `c`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
