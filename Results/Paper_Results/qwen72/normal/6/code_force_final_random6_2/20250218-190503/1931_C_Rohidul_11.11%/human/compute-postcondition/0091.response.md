To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```

The loop will execute again if both conditions are met:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1 (irrelevant to the loop condition)
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input (relevant to the loop condition)
- `l` is less than `r - 1` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `r` is `n - 3` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]` (irrelevant to the loop condition)
- `end` is 2 (irrelevant to the loop condition)
- `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` were 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is 2 (irrelevant to the loop condition)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `r > l`**:
   - `l` is less than `r - 1`, which means `l` is at least 1 less than `r`.
   - `r` is `n - 3`, so `l` must be less than `n - 4` for the condition `r > l` to hold true.

2. **Condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**:
   - This condition depends on the values of `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The state of `r` and `l` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop condition is met.
- Since `r` is `n - 3` and `l` is less than `r - 1`, the condition `r > l` is already satisfied.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true for the loop to execute again. This condition depends on the values in the list `a` and cannot be directly adjusted.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `r` and `l` is already such that `r > l` is true.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true, but this is a property of the list `a` and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration does not need to be changed for the loop to execute one more time, assuming `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is 2, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` were 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is 2**.
