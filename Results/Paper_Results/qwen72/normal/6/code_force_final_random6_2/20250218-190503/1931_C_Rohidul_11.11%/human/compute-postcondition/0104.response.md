To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(0, ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `l` is less than `r - 1`.
   - `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all \(0 \leq l < r\).
   - `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`.
   - `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`.

2. **Conditions for `ans`:**
   - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
   - Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - If either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, then `ans` is `r - l`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(max(0, ans))` will print the maximum of 0 and `ans`.

Let's break down the possible values of `ans` based on the conditions:

- **Case 1: `a[0] == a[-1]`**
  - In this case, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
  - `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
  - `l` is less than `r - 1`.
  - Therefore, `r - l - 1` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements between `l` and `r` (excluding `l` and `r`).

- **Case 2: `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`**
  - In this case, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
  - This means `ans` is the total number of elements in the list `a` minus 1.

- **Case 3: `a[0] != a[-1]` and either `st != 0` or `end != 0`**
  - In this case, `ans` is `r - l`.
  - `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
  - `l` is less than `r - 1`.
  - Therefore, `r - l` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements between `l` and `r` (including `l` and `r`).

Finally, the `print(max(0, ans))` statement will ensure that the output is at least 0. If `ans` is negative, it will print 0. Otherwise, it will print the value of `ans`.

### Conclusion:
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, the output will be `r - l - 1`.
- If `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, the output will be `len(a) - 1`.
- If `a[0] != a[-1]` and either `st != 0` or `end != 0`, the output will be `r - l`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(0, ans) (where ans is determined by the conditions: if a[0] == a[-1], ans is r - l - 1; if a[0] != a[-1] and st == 0 and end == 0, ans is len(a) - 1; if a[0] != a[-1] and either st != 0 or end != 0, ans is r - l)**
