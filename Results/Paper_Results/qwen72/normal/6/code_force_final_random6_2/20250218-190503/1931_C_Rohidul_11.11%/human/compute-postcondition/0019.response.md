Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `t - 1`, `r` is `t - 3`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `end` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `t - 3`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `st`, `end`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]` is still valid, but now `r` is `t - 3`.
- The condition `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r` is still valid, but now `r` is `t - 3`.
