Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`, `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`. If `st` is 0 and `end` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l` and either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.***
