Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input where the first `st` elements are all equal, `l` is `st`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list, `end` is 0, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `l` will be equal to `st`, which is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the beginning of the list `a`. The loop will stop when it either reaches the end of the list (`l` is no longer less than `r`) or when it encounters the first element that is not equal to the previous element. The variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `end`, and `ans` will remain unchanged from their initial states, with `r` still being `n - 1` and `end` still being 0. The variable `st` will contain the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start of the list.
