The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the number of elements in the list `a` that are not part of the longest prefix or suffix of consecutive equal elements. The result for each test case is printed, and it is the maximum of 0 and the calculated value.
