The only variable in the loop head is the anonymous variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is given that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. Therefore, the input should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input provided to `int(input())` must be `t`**
