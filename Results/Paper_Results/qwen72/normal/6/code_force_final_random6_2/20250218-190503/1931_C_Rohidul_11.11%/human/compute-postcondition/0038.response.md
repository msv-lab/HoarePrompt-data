Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**

Explanation:
- `l` is now 0.
- `r` is now `n - 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `st`, and `ans`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
