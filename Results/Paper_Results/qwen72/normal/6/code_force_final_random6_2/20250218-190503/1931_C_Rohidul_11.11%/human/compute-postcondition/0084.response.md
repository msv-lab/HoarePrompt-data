Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` were 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the variable `l` will be the largest index such that all elements from the start of the list up to `l` are equal to `a[0]`. The variable `st` will be the count of these consecutive equal elements. The variable `r` remains `n - 1`, and `end` remains 0. The value of `ans` will be 0 if the first and last elements of the list are equal, otherwise it will be `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` are 0, or 0 if either `st` or `end` is not 0.
