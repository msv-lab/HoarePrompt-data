Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` are 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0.**
