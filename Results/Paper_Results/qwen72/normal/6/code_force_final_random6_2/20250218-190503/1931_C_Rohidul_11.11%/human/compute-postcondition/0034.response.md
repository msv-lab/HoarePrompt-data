To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(0, ans))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions that define the value of `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is less than `t - 1`.
- `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is `l`.
- `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all \(0 \leq st < r\).
- `end` is the number of times the loop executed.

### Conditions for `ans`:
1. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
2. Otherwise, if `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
3. If `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `ans` depends on the conditions specified.
- The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print the maximum of 0 and the value of `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **First Condition**:
   - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
   - The `print` statement will output `max(0, r - l - 1)`.

2. **Second Condition**:
   - If `a[0] != a[-1]`, `st == 0`, and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - The `print` statement will output `max(0, len(a) - 1)`.

3. **Third Condition**:
   - If `a[0] != a[-1]` and either `st != 0` or `end != 0`, then `ans` is `r - l`.
   - The `print` statement will output `max(0, r - l)`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the maximum of 0 and the value of `ans` based on the conditions.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(0, ans) (where `ans` is defined as follows:**
- **If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**
- **Otherwise, if `a[0] != a[-1]`, `st == 0`, and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
- **If `a[0] != a[-1]` and either `st != 0` or `end != 0`, then `ans` is `r - l`.**
- **The final output is the maximum of 0 and the value of `ans`.)**
