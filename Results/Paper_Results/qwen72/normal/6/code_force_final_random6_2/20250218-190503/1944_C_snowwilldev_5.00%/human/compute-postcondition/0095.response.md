Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` initialized with `int`, meaning it will return 0 for any key that is not already in the dictionary.
   - `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. This means that `cnt` will count the occurrences of each element in the list `a`.
   - `tc` is incremented by 1.
   - `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the print statement will output 2.

Output: **2**
