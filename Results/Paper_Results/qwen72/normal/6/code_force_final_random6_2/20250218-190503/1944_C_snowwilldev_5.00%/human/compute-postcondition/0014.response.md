The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `t` is 0, so after the increment, `t` becomes 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is 1, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**
