Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.
- The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[i]]` by 1.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`.
- However, in the initial state, `i` is 1, and `cnt[a[0]]` is already incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by an additional 1, making it incremented by 2 in total.
- The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.
