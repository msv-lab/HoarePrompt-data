Output State: **`N` remains the same, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `N` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will have reached the value `N-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The `cnt` dictionary will have been updated such that for each index `j` in the range from 0 to `N-1`, the count of `a[j]` in the `cnt` dictionary will have been incremented by 1. This means that each element in the list `a` will have its count in the `cnt` dictionary incremented by 1, reflecting the number of times each element appears in the list `a`.
