Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - If `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`, the program returns nothing.
   - Otherwise, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` and the program also returns nothing.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(2)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer 2.
   - The initial state describes conditions under which the program might return nothing, but it does not affect the execution of the `print(2)` statement.
   - The conditions `v[v[i]] == i` and `v[v[i]] != i` are checked, but the code snippet does not include any conditional logic that would prevent the `print(2)` statement from executing.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `v`, `i`, and `n`, the `print(2)` statement will always execute and print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
