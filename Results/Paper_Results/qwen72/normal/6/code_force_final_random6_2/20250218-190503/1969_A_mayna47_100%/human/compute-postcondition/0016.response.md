Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `i` is `n + 1`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. If for any `i` from 1 to `n`, `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program does not print anything and does not return.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed. The list `v` remains unchanged, with its first element being 0 and the rest being the integers provided by the user. If at any point during the loop, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` was true, the program would have printed 2 and returned, terminating the loop early. If this condition was never true for any `i` from 1 to `n`, the loop completes without printing anything or returning.
