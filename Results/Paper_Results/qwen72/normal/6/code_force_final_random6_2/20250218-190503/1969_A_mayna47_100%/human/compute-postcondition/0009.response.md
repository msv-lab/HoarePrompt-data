Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `i`, and `v`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `i`, or `v`.

Output: **2**
