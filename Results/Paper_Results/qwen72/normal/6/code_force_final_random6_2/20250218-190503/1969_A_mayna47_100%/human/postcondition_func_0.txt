The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` from the user, where each element `p_i` indicates the best friend of the i-th friend. The function then checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns. If no such pair is found, it prints `3` and returns. The final state of the program is that it has printed either `2` or `3` to the console, depending on whether a mutual best friend pair was found.
