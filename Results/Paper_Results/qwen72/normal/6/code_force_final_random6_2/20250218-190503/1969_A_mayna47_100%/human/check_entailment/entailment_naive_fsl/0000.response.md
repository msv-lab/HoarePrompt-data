Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the scenario where the minimum number of invitations required is more than 2 or 3. The program only prints 2 or 3 based on a simple check, which is insufficient to solve the problem for all inputs.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
6
2 1 4 3 6 5
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
3
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
2
3
2
```

In the third test case, the program incorrectly prints 2 instead of 3, because it only checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 2 if such a pair exists. This logic fails to account for the minimum number of invitations required when no such pair exists but a different configuration is needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
