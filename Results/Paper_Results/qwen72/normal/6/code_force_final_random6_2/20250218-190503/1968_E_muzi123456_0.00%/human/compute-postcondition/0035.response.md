The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
