Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all possible values of \(n\). Specifically, the program always places the cells in a single row, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-3|\} = \{1, 2, 1\} = \{1, 2\}
\]
This set has a size of 2, but the problem description requires maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For \(n = 3\), a better arrangement that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{2, 1, 3\}
\]
This set has a size of 3, which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
