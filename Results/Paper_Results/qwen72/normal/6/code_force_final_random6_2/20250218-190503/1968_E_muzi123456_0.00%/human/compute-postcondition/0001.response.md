The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Given that `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
