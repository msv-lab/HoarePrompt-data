The given `print` statement is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline, meaning the next print statement (if any) will continue on the same line.

### Variables and Objects:
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1**
