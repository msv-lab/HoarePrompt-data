Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 1 in the initial state, the `print` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
