Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.

The print statement is:
```
print('1', end=' ')
```

This statement prints the string `'1'` and sets the `end` parameter to a space character `' '`, which means that the next print statement will append its output to the same line, separated by a space.

Since the value `'1'` is a constant string, it will always be printed as is, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **1**
