Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is only used to define the range of the loop. The variable `i` will have the value of `n` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and `i` takes on the value of `n` in the final iteration.
