Output State: **`i` is `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `t - 1` because the loop starts with `i` at 0 and increments `i` by 1 for each iteration.
- For each iteration, `x` is an integer input provided by the user, and it must be between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) as per the initial state.
- The variable `y` is always set to `x - 1` during each iteration, so after the loop finishes, `y` will be the last value of `x` minus 1.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged because it is only used to determine the number of iterations and is not modified within the loop.
