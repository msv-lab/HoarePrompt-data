Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is `x - 1`.

The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Since `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` will be the value of `x` minus 1.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is an input integer greater than 0)**
