The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can refer to as `x` for simplicity. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `i` becomes 2. For the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `y` is `x - 1`**
