The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can refer to as `x` for simplicity. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must remain greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is `x - 1`**
