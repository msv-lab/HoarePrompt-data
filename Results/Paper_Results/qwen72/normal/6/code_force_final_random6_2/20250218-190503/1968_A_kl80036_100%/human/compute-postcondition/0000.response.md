The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The state of `t` and the individual test cases `x` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
