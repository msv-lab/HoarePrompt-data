Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the integer \( y \) (1 â‰¤ \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximum possible. The program simply sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it, which does not consider the \( \gcd \) function at all.

For example, consider the input \( x = 10 \):
- The program will output \( y = 9 \).
- However, \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).

A better choice for \( y \) in this case would be \( y = 5 \):
- \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).

Both \( y = 9 \) and \( y = 5 \) yield the same maximum value of 10, but the program does not consider other potential values of \( y \) to ensure it finds the correct one. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
