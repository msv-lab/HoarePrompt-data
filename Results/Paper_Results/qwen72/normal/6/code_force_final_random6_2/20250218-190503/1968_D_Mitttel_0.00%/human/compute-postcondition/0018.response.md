The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 4`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index + n - n - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
