The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The previous value of `index` was `3 * n + 8 + n + 4 + n`, which simplifies to `5 * n + 12`. After incrementing by `n`, the new value of `index` is `6 * n + 12`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is now `6 * n + 12`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
