Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program to verify this claim:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It correctly extracts the parameters for each test case and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - The function handles the input format as specified in the problem description, ensuring that all necessary data is read and processed correctly.
   - The function appends the result of each test case to a list and prints the results after processing all test cases.
   - This function is designed to handle the input and output requirements of the problem, and it does so correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` and determines the winner of the game.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to compute their scores.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
   - The function correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the scores.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function computes the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It uses a `visited` dictionary to track the positions visited and detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score.
   - It then computes the score for the remaining steps using the cycle score and any remaining steps after full cycles.
   - The function correctly handles the game mechanics, including the detection and handling of cycles, which is crucial for games lasting more than a few turns.
   - The function ensures that the score is computed accurately for each player, considering both the initial steps and any cycles.

**Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
- The program correctly handles the input constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
- The program correctly handles the permutation and array constraints (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The program correctly handles the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same.
- The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts for a very large number of turns (k up to 10^9) by efficiently detecting and handling cycles.

**Conclusion**:
- The program accurately implements the game logic as described in the problem statement.
- The function summaries and the original assessment are consistent with the program's behavior.
- No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.

Final: **True**. The given program is correct.
