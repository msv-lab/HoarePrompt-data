Output State: **The function is now set up to read from standard input, expecting a formatted string of integers. No variables have been directly modified yet, but the function is prepared to read the input data which will be split and processed to extract the number of test cases t, the length of the permutation n, the duration of the game k, Bodya's starting position PB, Sasha's starting position PS, the permutation p, and the array a. The conditions for these variables remain the same: 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.**
