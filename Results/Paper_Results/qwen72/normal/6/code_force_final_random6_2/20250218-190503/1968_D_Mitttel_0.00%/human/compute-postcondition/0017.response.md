The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `index`, `p`, `a`) are not directly modified by this code snippet, but their values are used to determine the value of `result`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 4`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index + n - n - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.**
