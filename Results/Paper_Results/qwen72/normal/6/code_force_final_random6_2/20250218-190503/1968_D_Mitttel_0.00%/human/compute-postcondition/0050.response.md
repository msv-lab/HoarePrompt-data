Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads from standard input a formatted string of integers to extract the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, Bodya's starting position `PB`, Sasha's starting position `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It processes these inputs and returns the result based on the game logic. If `PB` or `PS` are out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than `n`), or if `k` is less than 1, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns the outcome of the game for each test case, which could be a specific value or message depending on the game's rules.**
