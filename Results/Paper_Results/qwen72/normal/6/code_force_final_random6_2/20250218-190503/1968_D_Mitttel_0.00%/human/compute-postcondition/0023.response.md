Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 8`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n - 4]` to `data[index - n - 1 - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - 4]` to `data[index + n - n - 1 - 4]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 4.
- The initial state specified that `index` was already increased by `2 * n + 4`. After this additional increment, `index` is now increased by `2 * n + 8`.
- The ranges for `p` and `a` are adjusted to reflect the new position of `index` after the increment.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
