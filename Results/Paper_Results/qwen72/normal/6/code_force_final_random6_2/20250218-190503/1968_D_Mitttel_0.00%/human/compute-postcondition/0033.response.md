Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is now `3 * n + 8 + n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

The code snippet `PB = int(data[index + 2])` reassigns the value of `PB` to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`. Since this is the same value that `PB` already holds according to the initial state, the value of `PB` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
