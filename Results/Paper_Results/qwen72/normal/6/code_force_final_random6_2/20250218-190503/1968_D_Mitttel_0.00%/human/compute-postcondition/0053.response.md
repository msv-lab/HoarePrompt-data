Output State: **`score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from `start_pos` for `k` steps or until a cycle is detected, `current_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `steps` iterations, `steps` will be the number of iterations executed, `visited` will be a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was first visited, `cycle_start` will be the step at which the cycle was first detected, `cycle_length` will be 0, `cycle_pos` will be the position in the permutation `p` after `cycle_length` iterations, `cycle_score` will be the sum of the elements in `a` that were accessed through the permutation `p` starting from the `cycle_start` position for the entire `cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` will be `k - steps`, `full_cycles` will be `remaining_steps // cycle_length` (which is `k - steps` divided by 0, resulting in an undefined value or error).** 

Note: Since `cycle_length` is 0, the calculation of `full_cycles` results in an undefined value or an error (division by zero).
