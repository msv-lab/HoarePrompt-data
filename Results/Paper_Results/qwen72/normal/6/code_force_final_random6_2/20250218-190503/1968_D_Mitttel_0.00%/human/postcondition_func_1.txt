The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`, which is a positive integer within the bounds of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. It returns the sum of the elements in `a` accessed through the permutation `p` starting from `start_pos` for up to `k` steps. If a cycle is detected within these steps, the function calculates the sum of elements for the initial non-cyclic part and then for the full cycles and any remaining steps within the cycle. If no cycle is detected, the function simply returns the sum of elements accessed for the full `k` steps. The function does not modify the input arrays `a` or `p`, and it maintains a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited during the process.
