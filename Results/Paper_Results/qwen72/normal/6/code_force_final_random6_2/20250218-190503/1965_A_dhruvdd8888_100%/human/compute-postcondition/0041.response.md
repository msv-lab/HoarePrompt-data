Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the number of elements in a set. It then reads a line of space-separated integers, converts them to a set, adds '0' to the set, and sorts the resulting set into a list `nums`. The function modifies the elements of `nums` such that each element is reduced by the cumulative sum of the previous elements. It then determines a winner between 'Alice' and 'Bob' based on the modified list `nums` and prints the winner. The function does not return any value. The state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. **
