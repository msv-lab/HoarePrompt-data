### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of Product `m`**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `k[i]` and stores it in `m`. This is intended to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the coins.

3. **Distributing Coins**:
   - The program then calculates the bets `c[i]` for each outcome as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that the total bet for each outcome, when multiplied by its respective multiplier, will be `m`.

4. **Finding the HCF (Highest Common Factor)**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to find the HCF of the bets `c`. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.

5. **Checking the Sum of Bets**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the program outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the bets for each test case, or `-1` if no valid distribution is possible.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The goal is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- The program calculates the bets as `m / k[i]` and then reduces them by their HCF to find the smallest possible valid bets.
- The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Potential Issues:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**:
  - The program calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. This can lead to very large numbers, especially when `n` is large.
  - A more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, but the product `m` is used here to ensure that the bets are integers.

- **HCF Calculation**:
  - The HCF is calculated to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values. This is a valid approach, but the program should ensure that the HCF is calculated correctly.

- **Sum Check**:
  - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than `m / hcf`. This is the correct condition to ensure that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. However, the calculation of `m` as the product of all multipliers can lead to very large numbers, which might not be necessary. A more efficient approach would be to use the LCM of the multipliers, but the current approach is still correct.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it follows. It ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required results.
