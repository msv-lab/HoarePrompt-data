The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. The input list `numbers` is expected to contain at least one integer, and each integer in the list satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. After the function concludes, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the GCD of all elements in the list.
