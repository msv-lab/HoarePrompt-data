The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must be a list with at least 2 elements. Since `num` will iterate over `numbers[1:]`, the first element of this slice will be the second element of `numbers`. Therefore, `num` should be the second element of `numbers` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `k`, `numbers` is a list with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `numbers`**
