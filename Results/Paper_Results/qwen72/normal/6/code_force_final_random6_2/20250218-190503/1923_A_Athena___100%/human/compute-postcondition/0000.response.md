Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip. `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user.**
