Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `i` is the last index of the list `a` (if `a` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined), `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, `_` is less than `t`, and `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged as a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed. The variable `i` is the last index of the list `a` if `a` is not empty; otherwise, `i` is undefined. The variable `res` will hold the count of zeros present in the list `a`. The variables `_` and `n` remain unchanged, with `_` still being less than `t` and `n` still being the input integer.
