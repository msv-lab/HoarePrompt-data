You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder that has been incremented `t` times, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is the last index of the last list `a` (if `a` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined), and `res` is the number of zeros in the last list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. The function returns the state of the ribbon or an error message if the input is invalid. Each test case must have at least one cell with a chip.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
