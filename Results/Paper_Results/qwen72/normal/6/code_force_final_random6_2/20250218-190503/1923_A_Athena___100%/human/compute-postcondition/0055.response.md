Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, and `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and `res` remains 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0.***
