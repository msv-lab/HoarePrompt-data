Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).**

The initial state is updated such that `nums` is now a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
