Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the list of ship durabilities `nums`. This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It uses a deque to manage the list of ship durabilities, which is appropriate for efficiently popping elements from both ends.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is positive and `nums` has at least two elements.
   - It pops the first and last elements of `nums` (denoted as `a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` (denoted as `x`).
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`. If so, it reduces `a` and `b` by `x` and `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` or `b` are still positive after the reduction, they are added back to `nums`. If they are zero or negative, they are not added back, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each ship that has sunk.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks, which is correct because the remaining attacks cannot fully reduce both `a` and `b`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if `k` is still positive and there is exactly one element left in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, the function increments `ans` by 1 and returns it. This is correct because the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.
   - If the loop ends and there are no more attacks or more than one ship left, the function returns `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is large enough to sink all ships.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is not sufficient to sink any ships.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is just enough to sink the last remaining ship.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a deque allows for efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial for the problem's constraints.
   - The loop and conditions ensure that the program runs in a reasonable time for the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
