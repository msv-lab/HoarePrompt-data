Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the second element of the original `nums` deque minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is the second-to-last element of the original `nums` deque minus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
