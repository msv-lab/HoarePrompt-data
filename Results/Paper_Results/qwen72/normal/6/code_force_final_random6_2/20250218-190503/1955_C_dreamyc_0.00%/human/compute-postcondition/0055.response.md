The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9). 

Case_1: If a certain condition is met, the function returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n) and `n` must be at least 2.

Case_2: If the condition for Case_1 is not met, the function returns a non-negative integer `ans` which is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), where `n` is a positive integer at least 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns either `ans + 1` or `ans`, where `ans` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is a positive integer at least 2.**
