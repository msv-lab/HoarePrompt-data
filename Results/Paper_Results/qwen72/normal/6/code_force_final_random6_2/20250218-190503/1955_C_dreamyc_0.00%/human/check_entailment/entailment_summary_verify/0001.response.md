### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - The program uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships. A `deque` allows for fast popping from both ends, which is necessary for simulating the Kraken's attacks on the first and last ships.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last ships (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`).
   - If the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to reduce both `a` and `b` by `x`, it does so and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` or `b` still have positive durability after the attack, they are reinserted into the `deque`.
   - If a ship's durability drops to zero, it is not reinserted and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - After the while loop, if there is exactly one ship left and the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), the program increments the count of sunk ships by one and returns the result.
   - This ensures that the last ship is correctly handled if it can be sunk with the remaining attacks.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there is only one ship left and it can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - It also handles the case where the Kraken's attacks are insufficient to sink any more ships.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently reduces the number of attacks and ships, ensuring that it can handle the constraints provided in the problem description.
   - The use of `deque` ensures that the operations are performed in O(1) time, making the overall complexity O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function `func_1` correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks by:
  - Popping the first and last elements of the `deque` to get the durabilities of the first and last ships.
  - Calculating the minimum durability `x` and reducing both `a` and `b` by `x` if `k` is sufficient.
  - Reinserting the remaining durabilities of `a` and `b` back into the `deque` if they are still positive.
  - Incrementing the count of sunk ships `ans` if either `a` or `b` is sunk.
  - Handling the case where only one ship remains and it can be sunk with the remaining attacks.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships for each test case. The use of `deque` ensures efficient handling of the ships, and the logic is sound for both the multiple ship and single ship cases.

Final: **True**
