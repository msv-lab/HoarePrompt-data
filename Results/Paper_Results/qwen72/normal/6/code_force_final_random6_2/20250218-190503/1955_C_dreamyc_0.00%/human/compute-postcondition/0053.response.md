Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k < 10^15), `nums` is a deque of 0 or 1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ans ≤ n). Additionally, either `k` is 0, or `nums` has more than 1 element, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.**
