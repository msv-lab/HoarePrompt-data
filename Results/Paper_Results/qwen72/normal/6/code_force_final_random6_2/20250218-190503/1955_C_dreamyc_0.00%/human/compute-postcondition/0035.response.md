Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` or `n-2` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the second element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the second-to-last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0 and `a` > 0, `nums` is a deque of `n` positive integers, and `ans` is 0. If `b` > 0 and `a` is 0, `ans` is 1. If `b` is 0 and `a` > 0, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` positive integers, and `ans` is 0. If `b` is 0 and `a` is 0, `ans` is 1. In all cases, if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
