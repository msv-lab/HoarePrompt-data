Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while k and len(nums) >= 2:
    a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
    x = min(a, b)
    if k >= 2 * x:
        a -= x
        b -= x
        k -= 2 * x
    else:
        break
    if a > 0:
        nums.appendleft(a)
    else:
        ans += 1
    if b > 0:
        nums.append(b)
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n-2 or n-1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0 and `a` > 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`, `a` is updated to `a - x`, and `b` is updated to `b - x`. If `b` > 0 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `k` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b` > 0 and `a` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 1 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`. If `b` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` or `n-2` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the second element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the second-to-last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0 and `a` > 0, `nums` is a deque of `n` positive integers, and `ans` is 0. If `b` > 0 and `a` is 0, `ans` is 1. If `b` is 0 and `a` > 0, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` positive integers, and `ans` is 0. If `b` is 0 and `a` is 0, `ans` is 1. In all cases, if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-3` or `n-4` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0, then `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-3` positive integers. If `a` > 0, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, `x` is updated to the new minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `a` ≤ 0, then `ans` is 1. If `b` ≤ 0, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. In both cases, if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, the updates to `a`, `b`, `x`, and `k` are performed. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
