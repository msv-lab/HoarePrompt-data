Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n-2 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque minus the minimum of the first and last elements of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque minus the minimum of the original `a` and `b`, `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`, and `k` is at least twice the value of the original `x`.**

Explanation:
- `b` is updated to `b - x`.
- The original value of `b` was the last element of the `nums` deque.
- `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`.
- Therefore, the new value of `b` is the last element of the `nums` deque minus the minimum of the original `a` and `b`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
