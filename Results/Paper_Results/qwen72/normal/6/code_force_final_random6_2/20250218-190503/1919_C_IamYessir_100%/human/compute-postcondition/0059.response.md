Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `lit` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is not modified. If `y` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, if the second element of `lit` is greater than `x` and `y`, `a` is a list that now includes the second element of `lit`.***
