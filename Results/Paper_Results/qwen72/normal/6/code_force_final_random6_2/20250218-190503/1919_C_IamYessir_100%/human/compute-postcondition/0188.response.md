The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.**
