Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. The value `lit[1]` is appended to the list `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value at index `1` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. The value of `i` is `1`, so `lit[1]` is appended to `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
