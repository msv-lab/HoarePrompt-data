Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, and `cp` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x > y`, then: if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `b` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `y` is set to this new last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, `b` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `y` is set to this new last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `x` is set to this new last element of `a`. If `x ≤ y`, then: if `x == y`, `a` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`), while `y` remains positive infinity if `b` is an empty list or retains its last element if `b` is not empty. If `x < y`, then: if `x` ≥ `lit[2]`, `a` now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `y`, `a` now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` ≤ `y` and `lit[2]` > `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[2]` if `b` was initially empty). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` ≤ `y` and `lit[2]` ≤ `x`, `b` remains unchanged and `y` retains its initial value. If `x` ≥ `y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
