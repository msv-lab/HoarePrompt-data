Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2.
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cp` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on some conditions in the loop.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.
- If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.
- `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty.
- `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.
- `b` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `s` is the total count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`b` must have at least 2 elements**: This means `b` is not empty and has at least 2 elements.
2. **`s` is the total count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element**: This implies that `s` is a count of how many times an element in `b` is greater than the element immediately before it.

Given that `b` has at least 2 elements, the value of `s` will be the count of such occurrences in `b`.

### Output:
The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

Output: **s (where s is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element)**
