Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element, `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element, `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty, `b` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty, `b` must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
