Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 0.**

The value of `cp` is set to 0, which was already its initial value, so no change occurs. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
