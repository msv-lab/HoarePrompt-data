To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
   - `a` and `b` are lists where each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the element before it, and each element in `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it.
   - `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity.
   - `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.
   - `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it plus the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it.

2. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is calculated by counting the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it and adding it to the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it.
   - Since each element in `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it, the only way an element can be strictly greater is if it is greater than the element immediately before it.

3. **Calculating `s`:**
   - For list `a`, if there are `m` elements in `a`, the number of times an element is strictly greater than the element immediately before it can be at most `m - 1` (since the first element has no element before it to compare with).
   - Similarly, for list `b`, if there are `k` elements in `b`, the number of times an element is strictly greater than the element immediately before it can be at most `k - 1`.

4. **Combining the Counts:**
   - The total value of `s` is the sum of the counts from both lists `a` and `b`.
   - Therefore, `s` can be at most `(m - 1) + (k - 1)`, where `m` is the length of `a` and `k` is the length of `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it and the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it and the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it)**
