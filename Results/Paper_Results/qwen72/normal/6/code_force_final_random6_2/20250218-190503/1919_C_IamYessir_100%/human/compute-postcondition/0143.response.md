Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list that now includes the first element of `lit` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. `b` is a list. `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[0]` if `a` was updated, otherwise it remains as the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty). `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. `s` is 0, `x` is greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
