The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. Specifically, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the size of the array `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, it is likely that the function processes the array `a` in some way and returns a result based on the processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
