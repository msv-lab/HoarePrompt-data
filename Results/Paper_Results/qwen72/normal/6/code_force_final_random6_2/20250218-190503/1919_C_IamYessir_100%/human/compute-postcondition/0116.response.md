Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `b` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element in `a` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` remains equal to `t`.
- The variable `lit` remains the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `cp` remains 0.
- The variable `i` is now `len(b) - 1`, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, with each element being less than or equal to the next element.
- The list `b` remains unchanged, with each element being less than or equal to the next element.
- The variable `x` is still the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise it is positive infinity.
- The variable `y` is still the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise it is positive infinity.
- The variable `s` is now the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element (which is 0 since `a` is non-decreasing) and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element for all valid indices from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
