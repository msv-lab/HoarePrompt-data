Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is either infinity if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`.** 

The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
