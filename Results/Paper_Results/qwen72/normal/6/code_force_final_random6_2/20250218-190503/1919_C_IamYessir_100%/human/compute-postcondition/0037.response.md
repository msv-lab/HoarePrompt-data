The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. The value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a`, `b` is a list with the length of 0 and `y` is infinity, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
