Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `s` is 0, and `x` is greater than `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` contains the first element of `lit`, `y` is the first element of `lit`, and `x` remains as the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes the element `lit[i]`, `y` is set to `lit[i]`, and `x` remains as the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` includes the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to `lit[0]`, and `y` remains as the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.***
