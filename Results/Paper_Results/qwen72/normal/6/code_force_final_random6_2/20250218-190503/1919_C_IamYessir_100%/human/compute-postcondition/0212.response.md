Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty.**

The code snippet `s = 0` resets the variable `s` to 0, but all other variables and their values remain unchanged. The conditions and initial states for `t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are still valid.
