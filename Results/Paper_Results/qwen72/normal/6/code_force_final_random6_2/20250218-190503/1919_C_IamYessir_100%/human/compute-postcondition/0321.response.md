Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a` was an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` before the execution. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 2, the element `lit[2]` is appended to `a`.
- The value of `n` remains at least 3.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `x` remains the same as it was before the execution: if `a` was an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` before the execution.
- The value of `y` remains the same as it was before the execution: if `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.
- The list `a` now has an additional element at the end, which is `lit[2]`.
