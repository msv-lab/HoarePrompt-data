Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, if `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of `a`.***
