Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list, `b` is a list, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, and `s` is 0. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`.**
