Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with the element `lit[2]` appended, `b` is a list, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `a` was an empty list before, `x` is now set to `lit[2]`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a` (which is now `lit[2]`).**
