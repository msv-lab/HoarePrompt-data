Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]`). If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. `x` is less than `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it.**
