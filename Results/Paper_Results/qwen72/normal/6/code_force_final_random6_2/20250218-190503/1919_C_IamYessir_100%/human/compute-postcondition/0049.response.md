Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**

The value of `x` is now the last element of the list `lit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
