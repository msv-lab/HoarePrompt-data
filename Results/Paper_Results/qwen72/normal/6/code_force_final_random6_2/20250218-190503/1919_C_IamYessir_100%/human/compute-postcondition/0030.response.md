The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This impacts the list `a` and the value of `x`, which is the last element of `a`.

- `a` is initially an empty list or a non-empty list. After the code, `a` will have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.
- `x` is initially the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty. After the code, `x` will be the new last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.
- `i` is 0, so the element at index 0 of `lit` is appended to `a`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `b`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list (empty or non-empty), `y` is the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty, and `x` is less than or equal to `y`.**
