Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index 2 of the list `lit` to the list `b`. The value of `lit[2]` is appended to `b`, and the rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
