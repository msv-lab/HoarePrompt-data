Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `b` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element in `a` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 1.**
