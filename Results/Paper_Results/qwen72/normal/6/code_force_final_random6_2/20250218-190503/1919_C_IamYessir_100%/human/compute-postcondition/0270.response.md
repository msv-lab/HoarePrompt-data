`a.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`.

- The value of `n` remains at least 2.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `x` remains the last element of `a` if the length of `a` is not 0, or infinity if the length of `a` is 0. However, since `lit[i]` is added to `a`, the length of `a` is now at least 1, and `x` is set to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`.
- The value of `y` remains the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0, or infinity if the length of `b` is 0.
- The condition `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y` remains valid.
- The current value of `x` is now `lit[i]`, and it is still greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `y` is the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is infinity, `x` is less than `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, and the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
