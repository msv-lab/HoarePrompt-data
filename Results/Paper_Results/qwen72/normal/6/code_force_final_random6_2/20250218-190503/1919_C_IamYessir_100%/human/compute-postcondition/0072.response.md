Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is not modified.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now the last element of `a`, and all other conditions and values from the initial state are still valid.
