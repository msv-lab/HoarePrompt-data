Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element in `a` is less than or equal to the next element in `a`, and each element in `b` is less than or equal to the next element in `b`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `s` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `s` to 0, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
