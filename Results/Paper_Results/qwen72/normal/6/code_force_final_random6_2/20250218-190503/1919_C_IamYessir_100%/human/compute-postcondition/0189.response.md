Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0, `x` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `x` to infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `x`.
