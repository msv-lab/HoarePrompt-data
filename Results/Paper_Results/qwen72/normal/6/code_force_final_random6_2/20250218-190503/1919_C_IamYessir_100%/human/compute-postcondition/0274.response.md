Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. `x` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`.**
