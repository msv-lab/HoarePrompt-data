Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first `m+1` elements of `a` and `b` minus 1. If `ca[a[m]] < cb[a[m]]`, `sm` is increased by 1. `ans` is 1 if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and `r` is `m`. The current value of `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to the value of `cb[a[r - m]]`.**
