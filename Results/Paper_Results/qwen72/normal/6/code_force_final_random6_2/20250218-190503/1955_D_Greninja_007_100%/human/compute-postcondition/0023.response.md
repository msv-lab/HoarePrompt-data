Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first `m+1` elements of `a` and `b` minus 1, `ans` is 2 if the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `r` is `m + 1`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 1.**
