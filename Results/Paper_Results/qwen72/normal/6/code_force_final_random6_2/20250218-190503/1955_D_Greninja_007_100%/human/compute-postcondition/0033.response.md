Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m+1` elements of the list `a`. `r` is `m + 2`, `ca[a[r - m - 1]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decreased by 1, `ca[a[r]]` is increased by 2. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `sm` is decreased by 1. If the original `sm` was less than `k`, `ans` remains 0. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. If the original `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` and the new `sm` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1.**
