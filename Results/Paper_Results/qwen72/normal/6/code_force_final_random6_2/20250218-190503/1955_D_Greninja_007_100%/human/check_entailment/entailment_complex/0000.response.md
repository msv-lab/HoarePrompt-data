Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a `Counter` for both the sorted array `b` and the first `m` elements of the sorted array `a`. This is done to efficiently count the frequency of elements in both arrays.

2. **Initial Check**: It calculates the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b` using `(ca & cb).values()`. If this sum is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1. This correctly checks if the first subsegment of length `m` is good.

3. **Sliding Window**: The program then uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in `a`. For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
   - It checks if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its frequency in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` by 1, indicating that this new element contributes to the count of common elements.
   - It increments the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca`.
   - It checks if the frequency of the element `a[r - m]` being removed from the window is less than or equal to its frequency in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` by 1, indicating that this element no longer contributes to the count of common elements.
   - It decrements the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca`.

4. **Final Check**: After updating the window, it checks if `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.

5. **Return**: Finally, the function returns `ans`, which is the number of good subsegments.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic of the sliding window update:
- When adding a new element `a[r]` to the window, the program should only increment `sm` if the element was not already contributing to the count of common elements. Similarly, when removing an element `a[r - m]` from the window, the program should only decrement `sm` if the element was contributing to the count of common elements.

The current logic does not correctly handle these conditions, leading to potential incorrect updates of `sm`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Adding a new element to the window
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        # Removing an element from the window
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    
    return ans
```

### Correctness:
The original program has a logical flaw in the way it updates `sm` during the sliding window process. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
