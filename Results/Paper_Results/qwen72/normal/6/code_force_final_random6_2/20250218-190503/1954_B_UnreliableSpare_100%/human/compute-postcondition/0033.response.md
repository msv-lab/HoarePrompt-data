Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `arr[i] == val`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0. `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the current value of `cnt`.
- The initial state specifies that if `arr[i] == val`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
- Since the code snippet only updates `ans` and does not change the values of `i` or `n`, these variables remain the same.
- The value of `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `cnt`.
- The initial state's condition about `arr[i]` and `val` is still valid, and the value of `cnt` is not specified to change in this snippet, so it remains as it was before.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and the unchanged values of `i` and `n`.
