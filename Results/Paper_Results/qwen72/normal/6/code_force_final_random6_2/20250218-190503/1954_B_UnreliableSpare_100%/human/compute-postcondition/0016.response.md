Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined by the input and is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is defined by the input and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `arrays` remains unchanged as it is defined by the input and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is defined by the input and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `flag` will be True if all elements in `arr` are the same. If any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will break, preventing further iterations. If the loop completes without breaking, `flag` will remain True.
