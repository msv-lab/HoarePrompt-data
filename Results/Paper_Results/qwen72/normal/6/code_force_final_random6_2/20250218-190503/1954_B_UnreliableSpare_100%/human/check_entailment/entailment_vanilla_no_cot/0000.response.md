Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in how it determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if they are, outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make an array of identical elements stop being beautiful by removing elements. However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect.

Here's the issue:
- The program initializes `ans` with `Decimal('Infinity')` and then iterates through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`arr[0]`). This approach only considers the first element and does not account for other possible elements that could be removed to break the beauty condition.
- The beauty condition is that you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. To break this, you need to ensure that no such replacement can make all elements the same, which means you need to consider the entire array and not just the first element.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Checking if all elements are the same, in which case output `-1`.
2. Otherwise, finding the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no sequence of operations can make all elements the same. This can be done by finding the most frequent element and ensuring that its count is less than or equal to half of the array length after removals.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(arr)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            freq = Counter(arr)
            max_freq = max(freq.values())
            if max_freq * 2 <= n:
                print(n - max_freq * 2)
            else:
                print(max_freq - 1)
```

This version correctly handles the problem by:
- Checking if all elements are the same using `len(set(arr)) == 1`.
- Using a `Counter` to find the frequency of each element.
- Calculating the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition based on the most frequent element. If the most frequent element's count is more than half of the array length, removing `max_freq - 1` elements will ensure the array is no longer beautiful. Otherwise, removing `n - max_freq * 2` elements will suffice.
