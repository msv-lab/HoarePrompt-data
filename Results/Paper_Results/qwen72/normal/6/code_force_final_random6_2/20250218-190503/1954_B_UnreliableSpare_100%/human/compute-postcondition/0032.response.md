Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `arr[i] == val`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0. `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, with `i` still being 2 and `n` still being greater than 2. The conditions for updating `cnt` and `ans` based on `arr[i]` and `val` are still valid, but `cnt` has been updated to `cnt + 1`.
