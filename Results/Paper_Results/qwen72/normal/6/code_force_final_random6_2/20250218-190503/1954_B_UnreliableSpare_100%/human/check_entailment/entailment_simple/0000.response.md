### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, the function `func_1()` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take `t` and `arrays` as parameters.

2. **Array and Flag Initialization**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then sets a flag `flag` to `True` if all elements in the array are the same. This is done by iterating through the array and checking if any element is different from the previous one. If a different element is found, `flag` is set to `False`.

3. **Minimum Removal Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to represent an initially large value.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to the first element `val`. If a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and the count `cnt` of consecutive elements.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and the final count `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If `flag` is `False`, the program prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Function Signature**: The function `func_1()` should take parameters `t` and `arrays` as described in the problem. However, the function is defined without parameters, which is incorrect.
- **Consecutive Element Counting**: The logic for counting consecutive elements and updating `ans` is flawed. It only considers the first element `val` and does not handle cases where the array has multiple different elements correctly.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should handle multiple test cases correctly by passing the necessary parameters to `func_1()`.
- The logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove should consider all possible sequences of consecutive elements, not just those equal to the first element.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
