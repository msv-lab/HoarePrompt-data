Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. However, there are a few issues with the approach:

1. **Handling of All Elements Being the Same**: The program correctly identifies when all elements in the array are the same and prints `-1` because it is impossible to make such an array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the array before encountering a different element. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers sequences of the first element and does not account for sequences of other elements or the possibility that the array might become non-beautiful by removing elements from other positions.

3. **Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`**: Using `Decimal('Infinity')` for the initial value of `ans` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler integer value like `float('inf')` or a large integer.

4. **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove**: The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. The program should consider the entire array and find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make the array beautiful again. This involves checking for sequences of elements that can be removed to break the pattern of the array being beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
