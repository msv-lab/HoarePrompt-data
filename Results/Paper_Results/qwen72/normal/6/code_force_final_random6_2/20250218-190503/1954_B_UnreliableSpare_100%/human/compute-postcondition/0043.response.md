The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `arrays`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `arrays` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers. Each `a` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and contains integers `a_i` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `arrays`. The result for each test case is determined based on the properties of the beautiful array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list is a beautiful array of integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case in `arrays`.**
