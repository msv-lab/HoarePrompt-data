Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is False, and the second element of `arr` is not equal to the first element of `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
