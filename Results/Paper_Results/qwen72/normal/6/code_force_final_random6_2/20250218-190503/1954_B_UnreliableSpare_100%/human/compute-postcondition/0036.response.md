### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n-1`**: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is at the last index of the array, which is `n-1`.
- **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the array `arr`.
- **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers**: The value of `arrays` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input**: The value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False**: The value of `flag` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `val` before encountering a different element**: During the loop, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt` whenever a different element is encountered. This means `ans` will hold the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in the array.
- **`val` is the first element of `arr`**: The value of `val` remains unchanged as it is the first element of `arr` and is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the loop**: `cnt` is incremented for each consecutive element equal to `val` and reset to 0 when a different element is encountered. After the loop, `cnt` will hold the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
