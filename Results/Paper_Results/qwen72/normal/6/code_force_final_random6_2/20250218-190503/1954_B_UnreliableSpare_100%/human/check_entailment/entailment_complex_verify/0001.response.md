### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is one where we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we are given an array \(a\) and need to output the minimum number of elements to remove or -1 if it is impossible.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`, it first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1 because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If the array is not all the same, it initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the array to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This is done to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

4. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic to check if all elements are the same is correct. If all elements are the same, the array is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element is the answer. This does not necessarily break the beautiful property of the array.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To make an array non-beautiful, we need to break the condition where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) and \(a_i\) can be replaced with \(a_{i-1}\).
   - One way to do this is to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same and remove the minimum number of elements to break this subarray.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle this. It only considers the first element and its consecutive occurrences, which is not sufficient.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly outputs -1 because all elements are the same.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs 1, which is correct because removing the last element makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` non-beautiful.
   - For the array `[1]`, the program correctly outputs -1 because a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1 because removing the middle 5 makes the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the general case of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only works for specific cases and fails in others.

Final: **False**
