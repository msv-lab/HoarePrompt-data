The given `print` statement is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `-1`. The precondition provides a lot of context about the state of the program, but none of it affects the value printed by this specific `print` statement. The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
