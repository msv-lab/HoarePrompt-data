Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.** 

The initial state of the variables `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` remains unchanged. The variable `max_sum` is now set to -1.
