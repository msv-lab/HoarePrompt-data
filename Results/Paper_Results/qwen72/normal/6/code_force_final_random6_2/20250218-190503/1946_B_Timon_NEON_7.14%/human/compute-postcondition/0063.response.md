Postcondition: ***`arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to the value of `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.***
