Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the overall logic for performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations is missing. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incomplete Function Implementation**: `func_3` is defined but does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It should be responsible for performing the operations and calculating the maximum sum.

2. **Missing Main Logic**: The program does not have a main function or any code to read the input, process the test cases, and output the results.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays**: The `func_2` function attempts to find segments of the array but does not correctly handle the logic for selecting and inserting subarrays. It also does not consider the possibility of taking an empty subarray, which is crucial for the problem.

4. **No Modulo Operation**: The problem requires the final answer to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but this is only partially handled in `func_1`, which is not used in the main logic.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
