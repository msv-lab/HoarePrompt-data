### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum back into the array.
   - The final answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(number)`**: This function returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required modulo range.
     - **Correct**: This function is simple and correctly implements the modulo operation.

   - **`func_2(arr)`**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `arr`.
     - **Flaws**:
       - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` as lists, which is unnecessary. The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray can be found using a single variable.
       - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid, which can lead to incorrect results.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements in `arr` are negative, leading to an incorrect return of `[-1]`.
       - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all cases, leading to potential incorrect results.

   - **`func_3(number, quantity)`**: This function is not used in the provided code, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the program.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program involves:
     - Reading the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reading `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
     - Finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using `func_2(a)`.
     - If the maximum sum is negative, it is set to 0.
     - Calculating the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - Applying the modulo operation using `func_1(answer)`.

4. **Issues in Main Logic**:
   - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `max_segment[0] * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(a)`, as the sum of the array after `k` operations is the sum of the original array plus the maximum segment sum multiplied by the number of times it can be added (which is \(2^k - 1\)).
   - The function `func_2` has logical errors and does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the issues in `func_2` and the incorrect formula used in the main logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
