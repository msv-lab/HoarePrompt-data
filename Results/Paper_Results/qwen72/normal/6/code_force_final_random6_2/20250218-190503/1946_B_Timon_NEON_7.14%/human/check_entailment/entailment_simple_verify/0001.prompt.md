You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function simply returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\). This is a basic and correct implementation.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
     - It iterates through the array and updates `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
     - However, the logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` does not correctly handle the case where `new_segment` is empty or where the current element is negative.
     - Additionally, the function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function also does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum found by `func_2` and the number of operations `k`, but it is currently just a placeholder.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program is incomplete and contains logical errors in `func_2`.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented and does not contribute to solving the problem.
   - The program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements, especially the part about performing `k` operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical errors in `func_2` and the incomplete implementation of `func_3`. The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.
