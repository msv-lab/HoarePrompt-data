Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least three elements. `i` is 2. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. `new_segment` is either a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1, or it remains an empty list or is not modified. `segments_variants` now contains the list `new_segment` appended with the list `[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the list `new_segment` concatenated with the list `[1]` (since `i - 1` is 1) to `segments_variants`.
- If `new_segment` was a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1, then `segments_variants` now contains a list with the second element of `arr`, the integer 1, and the integer 1.
- If `new_segment` was an empty list or not modified, then `segments_variants` now contains a list with the integer 1.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_segment[0]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
