### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function simply returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\). This is a basic and correct implementation.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
     - It iterates through the array and updates `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
     - However, the logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` does not correctly handle the case where `new_segment` is empty or where the current element is negative.
     - Additionally, the function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function also does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum found by `func_2` and the number of operations `k`, but it is currently just a placeholder.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program is incomplete and contains logical errors in `func_2`.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented and does not contribute to solving the problem.
   - The program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements, especially the part about performing `k` operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical errors in `func_2` and the incomplete implementation of `func_3`. The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.
