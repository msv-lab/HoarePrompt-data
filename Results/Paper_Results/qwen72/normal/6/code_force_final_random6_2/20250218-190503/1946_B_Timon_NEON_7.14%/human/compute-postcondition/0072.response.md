The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list `arr` is within the range -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns `total_max_segment`, which is either `[-1]` if all sums in `segments_variants` are less than or equal to -1, or the segment in `segments_variants` with the maximum sum, including the sum of the subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants`, including the sum and the indices of the first and last elements of this segment. If all sums in `segments_variants` are less than or equal to -1, it returns `[-1]`.**
