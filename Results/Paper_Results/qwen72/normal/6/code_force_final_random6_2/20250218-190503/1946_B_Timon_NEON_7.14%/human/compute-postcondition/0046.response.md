Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least three elements. `i` is 2. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`. `new_segment` is either a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1, or it remains an empty list or is not modified. `segments_variants` is not affected.**
