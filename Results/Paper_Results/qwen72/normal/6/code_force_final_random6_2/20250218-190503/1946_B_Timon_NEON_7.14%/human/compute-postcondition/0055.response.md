Output State: **`arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray. `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`. `max_sum` remains -1, as it is not modified within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is created by concatenating `new_segment` with the list containing the single element `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `new_segment` is an empty list, the appended list will be `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- If `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, the appended list will be `[sum of current contiguous subarray, index of last element of this subarray, len(arr) - 1]`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, `new_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
