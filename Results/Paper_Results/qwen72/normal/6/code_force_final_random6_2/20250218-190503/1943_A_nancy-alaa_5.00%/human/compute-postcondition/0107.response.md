Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer `x` in `arr` such that `mpp[x] == 1` and `x` is the first integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that meets this condition. Otherwise, `first` remains False.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop:
- The value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- The value of `first` will be `True` if there is at least one integer in the list `arr` that appears exactly once and is the first such integer encountered in the range `[0, n-1]`. If no such integer exists, `first` will remain `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `arr`, and `mpp`) will retain their initial values as they are not modified by the loop.
