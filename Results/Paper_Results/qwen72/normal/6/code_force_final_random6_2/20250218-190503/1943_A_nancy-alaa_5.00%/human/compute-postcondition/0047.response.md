Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `first` is True.
   - The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 0, the print statement will output 0.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **0**
