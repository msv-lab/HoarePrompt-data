Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is `t-1`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer `x` in `arr` such that `mpp[x] == 1` and `x` is the first integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that meets this condition. Otherwise, `first` remains False.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains within the range 1 to 20,000, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The variable `n` is still an integer greater than 0, representing the number of elements in the list `a` for the current test case.
- The list `a` still contains `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
- The loop counter `_` will be `t-1` after all iterations, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` test cases.
- The list `arr` will be the list of integers input by the user for the last test case.
- The `mpp` object will be a Counter that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr` for the last test case.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, indicating that the inner loop has iterated through all indices of `arr`.
- The variable `first` will be True if there is at least one integer `x` in `arr` such that `mpp[x] == 1` and `x` is the first integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that meets this condition. Otherwise, `first` will remain False.
