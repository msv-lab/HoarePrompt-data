Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than `n-1`. If `n-1` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` is 1 and `first` is True, the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- If at any point `i` is not in `mpp`, the loop prints `i` and breaks.
- If `i` is in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True.
- If `first` is True and `mpp[i]` is 1, the loop prints `i` and breaks.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` and `first` will be True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than `n-1`.
- If `n-1` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` is 1 and `first` is True, the loop will break before completing all iterations. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.
