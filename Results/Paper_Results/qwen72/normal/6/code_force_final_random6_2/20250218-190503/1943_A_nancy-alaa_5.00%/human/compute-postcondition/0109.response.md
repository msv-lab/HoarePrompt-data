The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the prompt. However, given the context, the function likely processes the list `a` for each test case and returns some form of output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). For each test case, the function processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the elements of the list.**
