Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). 

One issue is in the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs. The program attempts to compute the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and then calculating a value \(x\) based on a formula. However, the formula and the logic used to determine \(x\) are not correct for the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the test case \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\). The correct output should be 4, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((3, 3)\). However, the program does not produce this output.

The program's logic is flawed in the following ways:
1. The formula used to calculate \(x\) is not derived correctly from the problem's conditions.
2. The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the problem's requirements.
3. The final result `suma - 2` is incorrect and does not account for all valid pairs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using a more straightforward approach.
