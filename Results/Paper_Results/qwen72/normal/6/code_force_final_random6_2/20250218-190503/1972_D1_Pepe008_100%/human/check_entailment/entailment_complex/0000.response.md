Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The annotated program attempts to solve this problem, but there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Formula for Valid Pairs**:
   - The program calculates `x` using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\). This formula does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is also not relevant to the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions**:
   - The program checks if \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 > 0\) and adds `x` to `suma` if true. However, this does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The additional increment of `suma` by 1 when \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is also incorrect and does not contribute to the correct solution.

3. **Output Adjustment**:
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case, which is not justified by the problem statement. The correct output should be the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to determine valid pairs and the final output calculation are both incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
