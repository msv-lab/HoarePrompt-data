Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is the result of the expression `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, `i` is 2, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the expression `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(a - 2 * 1) // 2` or `(a - 2) // 2`.
- The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it, so `suma` now holds the value of `(a - 2) // 2`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
