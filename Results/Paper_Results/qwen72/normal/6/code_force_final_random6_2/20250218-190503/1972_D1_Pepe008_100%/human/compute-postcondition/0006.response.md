Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1` which simplifies to `a // 1 + 1` and further simplifies to `a + 1`.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `x` is calculated as `a + 1`.
