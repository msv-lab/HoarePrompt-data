Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`.**
