The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. This impacts the values of `a` and `b` because they are derived from `info[0]` and `info[1]` respectively. However, the specific values of `a` and `b` are not known until the input is provided. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `suma`) are not directly affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\), then `suma` is incremented by 1 for each such \(i\)**.
