### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - Substituting these into the equation:
     \[
     d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a' + b' = k \cdot d \cdot b'
     \]
     \[
     a' = b' \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a'\) to be an integer, \(b' \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\) must be an integer. Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(b'\) must be 1. Therefore:
     \[
     a' = k \cdot d - 1
     \]
   - This means \(a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{n - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
     This is because \(a\) should be within the range \(1 \le a \le n\).
   - The program also incorrectly adds 1 to \(x\) and then checks for additional conditions that are not necessary. Specifically, the condition:
     \[
     (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0
     \]
     is not required and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The final subtraction of 2 is also incorrect and not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The formula used in the program to calculate \(x\) is incorrect. It should be:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{n - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - The additional checks and the subtraction of 2 are not necessary and do not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed, and the additional checks and final subtraction are not justified.

Correctness: **False**
