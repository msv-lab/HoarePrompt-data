The function reads an integer `T` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, where `1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates a sum `suma` based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. The final result for each test case is `suma - 2`, which is printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is that `T` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed.
