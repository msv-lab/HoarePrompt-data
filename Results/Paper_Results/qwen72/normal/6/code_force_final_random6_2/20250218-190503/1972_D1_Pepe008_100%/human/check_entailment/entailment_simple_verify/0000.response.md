### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step by step.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotated Code:
```python
import math

# State of the program right before the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    # State: The loop has completed all iterations. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is the input integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` from the last iteration, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` from the last iteration and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the last iteration, where `x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1 > 0\).
```

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Formula for \(x\)**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is not derived from the problem's conditions. It appears to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but it does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Condition for Incrementing `suma`**:
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. This condition is checking if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1)\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) are multiples of \(i^2\), which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The final result `suma - 2` is incorrect. It subtracts 2 from the sum, which is not justified by the problem's conditions. The correct approach should be to count the valid pairs directly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of valid pairs.

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        n, m = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The logic and formulas used in the program are flawed and do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
