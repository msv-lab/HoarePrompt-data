The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, and `suma` is 0. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so `b` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is at least 1. Additionally, `i` should start at 1 as specified in the loop.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
