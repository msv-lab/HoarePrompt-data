You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for the modulo operation.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is the probability of selecting any specific pair of children, given that there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) possible pairs.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adds these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum:**
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the expected sum of friendship values over all excursions.
   - For each of the `k` excursions, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value for that excursion.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a given excursion is calculated as:
     - `c * i * c * m`: This term represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the pairs that are friends and have their friendship value increased by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
     - `c * a`: This term represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs that are friends.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the expected sum `s` for all `k` excursions, it prints `s % M`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `c` using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is correct. This computes the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
  - The loop that sums the initial friendship values of all pairs is correct.

- **Expected Sum Calculation:**
  - The loop that calculates the expected sum `s` for each excursion is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in friendship value. The correct term should be `c * (a + i * m)`, where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values and `i * m` is the increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen in previous excursions.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:

- The original program has a logical error in the expected sum calculation.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
