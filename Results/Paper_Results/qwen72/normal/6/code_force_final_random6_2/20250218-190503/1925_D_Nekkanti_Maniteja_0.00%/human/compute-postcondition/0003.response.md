Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `c` depends on the values of `n` and `M`, but it is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
