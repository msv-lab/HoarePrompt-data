### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the necessary variables `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`.

2. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation:**
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is correct because the number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, and the inverse is used to normalize the probability of selecting a pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `a` is correctly updated to the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

4. **Updating the Sum `s`:**
   - The loop for `k` excursions updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is intended to account for the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.
   - However, the formula `c * i * c * m` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `c * (i * m + a)`, where `i * m` represents the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions, and `a` is the initial sum of friendship values.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `s` modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output for modular arithmetic problems.

### Corrected Formula:
The correct formula for updating `s` should be:
```python
s = s + c * (i * m + a)
```
This ensures that the expected increase in friendship values is correctly calculated and added to the sum.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect formula used in the loop, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Correctness: **False****

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected to n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * (i * m + a)
        
        print(s % M)
```

This corrected program should now correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for the excursions.
