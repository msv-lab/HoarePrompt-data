The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of children; `m` is an integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), representing the number of pairs of friends; and `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of excursions. Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers: `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the results for each test case based on the input parameters. The specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints, but it is implied that the function processes the friendship values and excursions to produce some result.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. For each test case, it also accepts `m` lines of input, each containing the indices of a pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The function returns the results for each test case based on the input parameters.**
