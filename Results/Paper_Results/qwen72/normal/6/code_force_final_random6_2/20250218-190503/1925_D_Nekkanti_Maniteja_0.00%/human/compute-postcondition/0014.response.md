Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f + f + f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the new values provided by the user, `m` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.
- Initially, `a` is `f + f`.
- After the execution of `a += f`, `a` becomes `f + f + f`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the new values provided by the user.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
