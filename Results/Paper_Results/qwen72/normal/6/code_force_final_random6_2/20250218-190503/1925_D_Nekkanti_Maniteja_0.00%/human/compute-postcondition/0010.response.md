Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the new values provided by the user, `m` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the new values provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
