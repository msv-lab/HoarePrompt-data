Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with the new values provided by the user, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than or equal to `k`.**
