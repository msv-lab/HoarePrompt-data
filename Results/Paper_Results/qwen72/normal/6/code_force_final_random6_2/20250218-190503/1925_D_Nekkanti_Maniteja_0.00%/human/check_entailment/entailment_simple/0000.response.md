### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively.

2. **Modulo and Inverse Calculation:**
   - The modulo `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is the number of possible pairs of children, and `c` is used to normalize the expected value.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `a` is used to store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - The loop iterates `m` times, reading the pairs and their initial friendship values, and adding them to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over all excursions.
   - The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value for the current excursion.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for the i-th excursion is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, where:
     - `c * i * c * m` accounts for the increase in friendship value due to the chosen pair being friends and their value increasing by 1.
     - `c * a` accounts for the initial friendship value of the chosen pair.

5. **Output:**
   - The final expected sum `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
  - The expected value calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * m * (i + 1)` because the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion, not by `i`.
  - The term `c * a` should be added only once per excursion, not multiplied by `i`.

### Corrected Calculation:
- The correct expected value for the i-th excursion should be:
  - `c * (m * (i + 1) + a)`

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected the denominator to n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (m * (i + 1) + a)) % M  # Corrected the expected value calculation
        
        print(s % M)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the expected value calculation.
- The corrected program should work correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
