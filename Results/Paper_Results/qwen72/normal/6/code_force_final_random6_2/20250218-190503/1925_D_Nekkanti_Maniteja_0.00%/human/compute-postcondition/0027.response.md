Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (0 * m + 1 * m + 2 * m + ... + (k-1) * m) + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `s`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- The conditions on `m` and `k` are still valid.
- The condition on the input value being greater than `k - 1` is still valid.
