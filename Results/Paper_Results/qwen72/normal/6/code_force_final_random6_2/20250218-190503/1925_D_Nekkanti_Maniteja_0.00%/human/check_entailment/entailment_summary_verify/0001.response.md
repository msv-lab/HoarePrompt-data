### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for the modulo operation.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is the probability of selecting any specific pair of children, given that there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) possible pairs. This part is correct.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adds these values to `a`. This part is also correct.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum:**
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the expected sum of friendship values over all excursions.
   - The original program updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion. This is incorrect because:
     - `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in friendship value. The term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * i * m` to represent the increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen in previous excursions.
     - The correct term should be `c * (a + i * m)`, where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values and `i * m` is the increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen in previous excursions.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the expected sum `s` for all `k` excursions, it prints `s % M`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:

- The original program has a logical error in the expected sum calculation, specifically in the term `c * i * c * m`.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all excursions by using the term `c * (a + i * m)`.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the expected sum calculation and provided a corrected version of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final evaluation is that the given program is incorrect.
