Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only checks if \(b\) is even, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem requires checking both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) to see if either can be divided into two equal parts, allowing the formation of a new rectangle. 

For example:
- For the input \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\), the program incorrectly outputs "No" because it only checks if \(b\) is even. However, the rectangle can be cut along the \(b\) dimension into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be used to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original.
- For the input \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\), the program also incorrectly outputs "No" because \(b\) is not even. However, the rectangle can be cut along the \(a\) dimension into two \(2 \times 1\) rectangles, and these can be used to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original.

The correct approach would be to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, as this would allow Bob to cut the rectangle into two equal parts and potentially form a new rectangle. The current program fails to do this and thus does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Final: **False**
