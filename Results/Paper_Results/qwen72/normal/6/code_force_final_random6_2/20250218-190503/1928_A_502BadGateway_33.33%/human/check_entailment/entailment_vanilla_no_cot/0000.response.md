Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if the second dimension `b` of the rectangle is even. However, the problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the pieces. The program should check if either dimension `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1, because only then can Bob cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

Here is the correct logic:
- If both `a` and `b` are 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
- If either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1, Bob can form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

The correct function should be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        return 'no'
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
