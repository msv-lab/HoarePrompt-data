Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 3, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]`, and `sng` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of the sorted list `lft` to the list `ldb`.
- Since `i` is 3, the element `lft[3]` is added to `ldb`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
