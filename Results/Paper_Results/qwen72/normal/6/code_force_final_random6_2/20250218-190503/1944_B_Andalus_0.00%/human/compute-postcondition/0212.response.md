Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
- `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged.
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed.
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
- `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed.
- `elem` is the second element in `rdb`.
- `rdb` must have at least 2 elements.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- `elem` is defined as the second element in `rdb`.
- `rdb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, so `elem` is a well-defined integer.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and `rdb` is a list of integers, the print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second element in the list `rdb`)**
