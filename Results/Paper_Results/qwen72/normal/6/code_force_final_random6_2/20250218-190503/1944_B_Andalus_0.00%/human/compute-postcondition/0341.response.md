The only object in the loop head is the list `sng`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sng`. If `sng` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `i`, `rdb`, and `sz` are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`sng` must have at least one element**
