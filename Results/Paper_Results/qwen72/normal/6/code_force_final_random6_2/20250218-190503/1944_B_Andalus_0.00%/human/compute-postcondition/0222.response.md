To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `sng`.

1. **`sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed**: This is a condition that needs to be true for the loop to execute, but it's not directly related to the initial state before the loop starts. We need to ensure that `sng` has at least one element to start the loop.

2. **`elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed**: This is a state that will be updated within the loop, but it doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The loop will set `elem` to the first element of `sng` during the first iteration.

Given the loop head `for elem in sng:`, the loop will execute if `sng` is not empty. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `sng` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least 1 element, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.**

This ensures that the loop can start executing, and `elem` will be set to the first element of `sng` during the first iteration.
