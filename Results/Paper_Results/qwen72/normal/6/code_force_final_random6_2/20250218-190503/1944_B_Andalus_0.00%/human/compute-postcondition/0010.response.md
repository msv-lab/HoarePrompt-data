Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end. After sorting, `rgt` remains a list but is now sorted in ascending order. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
