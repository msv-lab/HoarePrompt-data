To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context in which the `print` statement is executed. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must have at least 1 element.
   - `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Context of the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is printed on the same line with a space separating each element.

3. **Determining `elem`**:
   - The value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - However, based on the context, `elem` is likely an element from either `lft` or `rgt` (since these are the only lists mentioned that contain elements from `lst`).

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If the `print` statement is inside a loop that iterates over `lft` or `rgt`, it will print each element of that list, separated by spaces.
   - If the `print` statement is outside such a loop, it will print a single element, which we cannot determine without more context.

Given the lack of explicit information about the loop or the specific value of `elem`, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is an element from either `lft` or `rgt`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from either the `lft` or `rgt` list, which are sorted lists derived from the `lst` list)**
