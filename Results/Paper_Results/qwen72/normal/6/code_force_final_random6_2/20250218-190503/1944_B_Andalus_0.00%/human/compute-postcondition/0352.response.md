The only objects in the loop head are the variables `elem` and the list `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next (i.e., the subsequent) element in `sng`.

State: **`sng` must have at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
