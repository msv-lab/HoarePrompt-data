To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `ldb`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains `elem` and `ldb`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `ldb` is not empty. If `ldb` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

3. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
   - `sz` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The state of `ldb` must be adjusted to ensure it is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The state of `elem` will be determined by the elements in `ldb` once the loop starts.

### Adjusted State:
- For the loop to execute, `ldb` must contain at least one element.
- The state of `elem` will be the first element in `ldb` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is 0, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`**
