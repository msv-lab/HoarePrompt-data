Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `elem` is the next element in `sng` that will be processed, `sz` is incremented by 1, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
