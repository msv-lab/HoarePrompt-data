Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
   - `sng` must have at least 3 elements.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem` and using `end=' '` to ensure that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `sng` and `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` will be a specific value from the list `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is known to be the third element in the list `sng`.
   - The `print` statement will output this value followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
