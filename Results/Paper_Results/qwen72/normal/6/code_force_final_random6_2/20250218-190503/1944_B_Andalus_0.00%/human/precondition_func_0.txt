The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list `a` contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4. The function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of values `n` and `k`, and the list `a` is provided for each test case.
