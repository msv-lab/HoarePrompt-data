Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, and `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their preceding or succeeding element, and `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`T`**: Decreased by 1 from its initial value.
- **`_`**: Remains 1.
- **`n`**: Remains the first integer input.
- **`k`**: Remains the second integer input.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` is `n-1`.
- **`lst`**: Remains the list of integers input by the user.
- **`lft`**: Remains a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- **`rgt`**: Remains a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
- **`sz`**: Remains the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`.
- **`rdb`**: Remains an empty list.
- **`ldb`**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
- **`sng`**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their preceding or succeeding element.
