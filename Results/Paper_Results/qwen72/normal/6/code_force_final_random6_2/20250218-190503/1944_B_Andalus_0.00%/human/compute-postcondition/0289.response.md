Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is 2 and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
