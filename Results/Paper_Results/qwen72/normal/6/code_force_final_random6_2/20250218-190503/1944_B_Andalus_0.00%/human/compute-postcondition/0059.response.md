Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` must contain at least two elements.
   - `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 2.
   - `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - The value of `elem` is the next element in the list `ldb`.
   - `ldb` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the next element in this list.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the next element in `ldb`, and `ldb` must contain at least two elements, the `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the next element in the list `ldb`)**
