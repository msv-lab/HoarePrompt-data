The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is 2, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the second element of `lft`, and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` remains an empty list. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[i]` and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.**
