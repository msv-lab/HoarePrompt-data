Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is in. The values of `i`, `rdb`, `ldb`, and `elem` remain unchanged. Since the condition for increasing `sz` by 2 was not met (or the code did not execute the logic to update `sz`), `sz` remains 0.
