Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 0.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists).
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and relationships.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `ldb`.
   - Since `ldb` is a non-empty list, it must have at least one element. The precondition states that `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, so `ldb` must have at least two elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space.
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `ldb` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element in the list ldb)**
