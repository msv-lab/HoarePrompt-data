You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

The list `a` contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4. The function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of values `n` and `k`, and the list `a` is provided for each test case.

    #State: The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `_` is `T-1`, `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case, `lst` is the list of integers from the last test case, `lft` and `rgt` are the sorted sublists from the last test case, `ldb` and `rdb` are the lists of duplicate elements from the last test case, `sng` is the list of single elements from the last test case, and `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `ldb` and `sng` or until `sz` reaches `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two equal halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of duplicate elements from the first half and single elements from the first half until it has printed `k` elements. It then repeats the process for the second half, printing pairs of duplicate elements and single elements until it has printed `k` elements. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the sorted sublists and the lists of duplicate and single elements from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the elements in the left and right halves of the array do not have the required pairs to form the subsets `l` and `r` with the same XOR value. Specifically, the program assumes that the elements in the left and right halves are sorted and tries to find pairs of equal elements, but it does not ensure that the XOR condition is met for the subsets `l` and `r`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The program will output:
```
2 2 3 3
2 2 3 3
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

The program fails to correctly form the subsets `l` and `r` such that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r` for this input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
