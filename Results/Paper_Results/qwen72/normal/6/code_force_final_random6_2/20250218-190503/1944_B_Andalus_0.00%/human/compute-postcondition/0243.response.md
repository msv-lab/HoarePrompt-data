Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.**

Explanation: The code snippet `rgt = lst[n:]` assigns to `rgt` a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end. This list is already sorted in ascending order as per the initial state. No other variables are affected by this code, so the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
