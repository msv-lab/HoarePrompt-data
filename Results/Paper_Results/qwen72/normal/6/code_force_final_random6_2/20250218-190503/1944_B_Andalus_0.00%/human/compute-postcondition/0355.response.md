Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a list or iterable that must have at least one more element.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- `sz` is increased by 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

### Explanation:
- **`elem`**: This is the next element in the iterable `sng`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as the next element in `sng`.
- **`end=' '`**: This ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
Output: **[elem] (where [elem] is the next element in the iterable `sng`)**

This means that the print statement will output the next element in `sng` followed by a space. The exact value of `elem` depends on the current state of the iterable `sng`.
