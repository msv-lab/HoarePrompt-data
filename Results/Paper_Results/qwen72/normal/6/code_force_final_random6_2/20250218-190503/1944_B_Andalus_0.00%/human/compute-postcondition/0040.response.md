Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`. `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The initial conditions for `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`.
- The list `rdb` contains all elements from the `rgt` list (starting from index 1 to `n-1`) that are equal to their preceding element. If no such elements exist, `rdb` remains an empty list.
