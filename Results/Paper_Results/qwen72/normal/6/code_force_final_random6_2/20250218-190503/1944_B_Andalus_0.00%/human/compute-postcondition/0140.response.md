Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is 2, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed.** 

The code `sng.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 2, the third element of `lft` is added to `sng`. The variable `elem` is updated to be the last element in `sng` that was processed, which is `lft[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
