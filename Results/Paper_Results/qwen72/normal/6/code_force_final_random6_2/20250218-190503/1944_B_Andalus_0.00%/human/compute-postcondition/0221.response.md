Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `T`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged.
- The variable `sz` will be updated to the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until it reaches the value of `k`, whichever comes first.
- The loop will break if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k` at any point during the iterations.
- The variable `elem` will hold the last element in `rdb` that was processed.
- The list `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed, and `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed.
