Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `i` is 3, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]` appended to it, and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[3]`, and `elem` is `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.***
