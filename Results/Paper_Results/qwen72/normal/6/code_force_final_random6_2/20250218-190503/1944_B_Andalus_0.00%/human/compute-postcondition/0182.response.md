To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. The loop will execute if `sng` contains at least one element. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`sng` must have at least one element**: This is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **`elem` is the first element in `sng`**: This is the initial state of `elem` before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
- `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` and less than or equal to the number of elements in `ldb` times 2
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists)
- `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was processed
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop is exited. Otherwise, the loop would have processed all elements in `ldb` and `sz` would be equal to the number of elements in `ldb` times 2

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `sng` is non-empty and `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` and less than or equal to the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element**
