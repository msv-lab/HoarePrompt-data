The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is now `sz + 1`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
