The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the second element of `rgt` is equal to the first element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the first element of `rgt`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.**
