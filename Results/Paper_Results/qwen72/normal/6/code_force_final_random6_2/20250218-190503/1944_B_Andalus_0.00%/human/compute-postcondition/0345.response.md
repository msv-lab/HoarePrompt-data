To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `sng` is a list that must have at least one element.
- `sz` is the size of `sng`.
- `k` is a predefined integer.
- If `sz` (the size of `sng`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- Otherwise, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is inside a loop or if statement.
- The variable `elem` is an element from the list `sng`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is printed on the same line with a space separating each element.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `sz` (size of `sng`) is less than `k`**:
   - The loop or if statement will continue to execute.
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print each element of `sng` on the same line separated by spaces.
   - The output will be all elements of `sng` printed in sequence.

2. **If `sz` (size of `sng`) is greater than or equal to `k`**:
   - The loop or if statement will break before printing all elements of `sng`.
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will only print the elements up to the point where `sz` is checked and found to be greater than or equal to `k`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `sng` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list `sng`, and the elements are printed on the same line separated by spaces until the size of `sng` is greater than or equal to `k`)**

This means that the output will be a sequence of elements from the list `sng`, printed on the same line with spaces between them, until the size of `sng` is greater than or equal to `k`, at which point the loop or if statement will break.
