The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` was the first element of `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must still contain at least one element, and `elem` will now be the next element in `ldb`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 0. If `sz` is 2, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is 0, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`**.
