### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, `func_1()` reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Transformation of Array `a`**:
   - The program correctly modifies each element of the array `a` by adding the index `i + 1` to it. This step is in line with the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the transformed array `a`.
   - It then converts the transformed array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This step is necessary to ensure that the elements in the set `S` are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - To ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`, the program appends additional elements that are just below the current element in the sorted list, but only if they are not already in the set `S`. This is done by calculating the number of such elements (`adv`) and appending them to `ans`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (`cnt`), the program appends the next smallest elements to `ans` until `cnt` is zero.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which represents the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Transformation and Set Operations**:
  - The transformation `a[i] += i + 1` is correct.
  - Using a set to remove duplicates and sorting in descending order ensures that the elements are unique and in the required order.

- **Counter Usage**:
  - The `Counter` is used to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the transformed array `a`.
  - This is important for managing the number of elements that need to be added to `ans` to ensure the total length is `n`.

- **Gap Filling**:
  - The logic for appending additional elements (`adv`) is designed to fill gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the lexicographical order.
  - The use of `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])` ensures that the program does not add more elements than necessary and avoids adding elements that are already in the set.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where the same element might be inserted multiple times into the set `S` by using the `Counter` and set operations.
  - The program also handles cases where the array `a` might have repeated elements or be in any order.

### Potential Issues:

- **Complexity of Gap Filling**:
  - The logic for appending additional elements (`adv`) is complex but necessary to ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`.
  - The program correctly manages the count of elements and ensures that the total length of `ans` is `n`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles edge cases where the array `a` might have repeated elements or be in any order.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the steps required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the given problem description. The use of a `Counter` and set operations ensures that duplicates are managed correctly, and the gap-filling logic ensures that the array `b` is constructed in the required order.

### Correctness:

Final: **True**
