You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. After this, it removes duplicates from `a`, sorts the list in descending order, and constructs a new list `ans` that contains all unique elements from `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`. The additional elements are chosen to fill the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and are decremented by 1 from the last element of `a` if necessary. Finally, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Transformation of Array `a`**:
   - The program transforms each element of the array `a` by adding the index `i + 1` to it. This step is correct as it follows the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the transformed array `a`.
   - It then converts the transformed array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This step is necessary to ensure that the elements in the set `S` are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - To ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`, it also appends additional elements that are just below the current element in the sorted list, but only if they are not already in the set `S`. This is done by calculating the number of such elements (`adv`) and appending them to `ans`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (`cnt`), it appends the next smallest elements to `ans` until `cnt` is zero.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which represents the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The transformation step ensures that each element `a_i` is correctly modified to `a_i + i`.
- The use of a `Counter` and a set to remove duplicates and sort the elements is appropriate.
- The construction of `b` ensures that the largest possible elements are added first, and any necessary smaller elements are added to maintain the lexicographical order.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the same element might be inserted multiple times into the set `S`. However, the use of a set and the `Counter` ensures that duplicates are managed correctly.
- The logic for appending additional elements (`adv`) is complex but necessary to ensure the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the steps required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
