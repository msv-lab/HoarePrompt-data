Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer provided by the user.
3. `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order.
4. `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
5. `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a` (all counts are 0 or negative).
6. `cnt` is 0.
7. `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt` (where `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt`), the last `cnt` elements of `ans` are a sequence of integers decrementing by 1 starting from `ans[-cnt-1] - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order. For example, `a` could be `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which means it points to the last index of the list `a`. If `a` has 5 elements, `i` will be 4.

3. **Counter Object `counter`**:
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`. Since all counts are 0 or negative, this implies that `counter` is not used to add elements to `a` but rather to keep track of some condition or state. However, the exact usage of `counter` is not relevant to the final output of `ans`.

4. **Variable `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is 0. This means no additional elements are added to `ans` beyond the elements of `a`.

5. **List `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initialized to contain all elements of `a`.
   - Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are added to `ans` to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be exactly the same as `a`.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given that `ans` is exactly the same as `a` and `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, the output will be the elements of `a` printed in descending order.

Output: **[elements of `a` in descending order]**

For example, if `a` is `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`, the output will be:
Output: **10 8 6 4 2**
