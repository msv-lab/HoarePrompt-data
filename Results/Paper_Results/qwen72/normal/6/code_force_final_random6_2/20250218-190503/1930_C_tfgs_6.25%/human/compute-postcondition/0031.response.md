To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

The loop head is:
```
for j in range(adv):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `j`
- `adv`

For the loop to execute, `adv` must be greater than 0. Let's break down the conditions that affect `adv`:

1. `adv` is defined as:
   ```python
   adv = min(a[0] - a[1] - 1, cnt, counter[a[0]])
   ```

2. `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element.
3. `cnt` is defined as:
   ```python
   cnt = n - len(a)
   ```
4. `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`.
5. The count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1.

To ensure that `adv` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that:
- `a[0] - a[1] - 1` is greater than 0.
- `cnt` is greater than 0.
- `counter[a[0]]` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an integer provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element.
- `i` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop head).
- `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`.
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
- `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`).
- `j` is `adv - 1`.
- `adv` is `min(a[0] - a[1] - 1, cnt, counter[a[0]])`.
- The count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1.

We need to adjust the states to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0. This means:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements (to ensure `a[0] - a[1] - 1` is defined and can be greater than 0).
- `cnt` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than `len(a)`.
- `counter[a[0]]` must be greater than 0, which means `a[0]` must appear at least once in the list `a`.

Given these conditions, the adjusted state should be:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements.
- `n` must be greater than `len(a)`.
- `counter[a[0]]` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0 (since `j` is the loop index and starts at 0).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than `len(a)`, `counter[a[0]]` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
