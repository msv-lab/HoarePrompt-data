Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), `j` is `adv - 1`, the count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1, the count of `a[1]` in `counter` is now `counter[a[1]] - 1, and `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), and the value `a[1] - 1`, `j` is 0, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]` and must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), the value `a[1] - 1`, and the value `a[1] - 2`, `j` is 1, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]` and must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), the value `a[1] - 1`, the value `a[1] - 2`, and the value `a[1] - 3`, `j` is 2, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]` and must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
