Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a` (all counts are 0 or negative), `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`, the last element of `ans` is now `ans[-2] - 1`, and the new last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`**.

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`.
- The new element is `ans[-1] - 1`, which is the value of the current last element of `ans` minus 1.
- The length of `ans` is now `n + 2` because an additional element has been appended.
- The new last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`, which is the value of the second-to-last element of `ans` minus 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
