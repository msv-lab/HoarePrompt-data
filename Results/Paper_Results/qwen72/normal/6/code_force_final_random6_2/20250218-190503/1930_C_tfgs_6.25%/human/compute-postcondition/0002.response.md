The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` as described in the task does not need to be changed for the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is 0**
