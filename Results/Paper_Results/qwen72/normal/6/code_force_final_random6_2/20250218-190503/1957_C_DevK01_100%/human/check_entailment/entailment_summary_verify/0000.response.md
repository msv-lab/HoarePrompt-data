Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions for placing rooks.

2. **Move Processing**:
   - The program correctly processes each move `(a, b)`. If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied. If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one position `(a, a)` is occupied.
   - This logic is consistent with the problem description and ensures that the number of available positions is updated correctly.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
   - This formula is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, which is a well-known problem in combinatorics.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

**Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
- The original assessment did not explicitly mention the correctness of the DP formula, but it is indeed correct for the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 0 or when `n` is very large.

**Conclusion**:
- The program correctly processes the input, updates the number of available positions, and calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.
- The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
