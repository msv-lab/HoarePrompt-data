Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. Each test case reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The function `func_1` implements a binary search algorithm. The binary search is used to find the position `l` where the element `find` should be if the array were sorted. The logic for updating `l` and `r` is correct:
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, it sets `r = mid - 1`.
   - If `array[mid] < find`, it sets `l = mid + 1`.

3. **Check for Correct Position**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if the element `find` is at the correct position `l` in the permutation. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the actual position of `find`.

4. **Output Handling**: The program correctly prints the number of operations and the indices for the swaps. However, there is a logical issue in the output handling:
   - The function `func_1` prints `1` or `0` directly, which is not part of the required output format. The output should only contain the number of operations followed by the indices of the swaps.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the binary search finds the correct position for `find` and no swaps are needed. It should print `0` and return an empty list in such cases.

6. **Correctness of Swap Logic**: The swap logic is correct in that it ensures the element `find` is moved to the correct position `l` where the binary search would find it. However, the program does not ensure that the array is in a state where the binary search can correctly find the element in at most 2 swaps.

7. **Overall Logic**: The program's overall logic is flawed because it only performs a single swap and does not consider the possibility of needing a second swap to ensure the array is in a state where the binary search can find the element correctly.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the output format and does not ensure that the array is in a state where the binary search can find the element with at most 2 swaps. It only performs a single swap and does not consider the need for a second swap. Additionally, the function `func_1` should not print anything; it should only return the required output.
