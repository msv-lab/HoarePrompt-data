Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and the element at index `mid` in `array` is greater than or equal to `find`.**
