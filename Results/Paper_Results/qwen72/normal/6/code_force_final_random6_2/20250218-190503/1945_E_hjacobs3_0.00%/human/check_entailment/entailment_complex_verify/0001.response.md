Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. Each test case reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The function `func_1` implements a binary search algorithm. The binary search is used to find the position `l` where the element `find` should be if the array were sorted. The logic for updating `l` and `r` is correct:
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, it sets `r = mid - 1`.
   - If `array[mid] < find`, it sets `l = mid + 1`.

3. **Check for Correct Position**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if the element `find` is at the correct position `l` in the permutation. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the actual position of `find`.

4. **Output Handling**: The program has a significant issue in the output handling:
   - The function `func_1` prints `1` or `0` directly, which is not part of the required output format. The output should only contain the number of operations followed by the indices of the swaps.
   - The function should not print anything; it should only return the required output.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the binary search finds the correct position for `find` and no swaps are needed. It should print `0` and return an empty list in such cases. However, the function currently prints `0` and returns `None`, which is incorrect.

6. **Correctness of Swap Logic**: The swap logic is correct in that it ensures the element `find` is moved to the correct position `l` where the binary search would find it. However, the program does not ensure that the array is in a state where the binary search can correctly find the element in at most 2 swaps. It only performs a single swap and does not consider the need for a second swap.

7. **Overall Logic**: The program's overall logic is flawed because it only performs a single swap and does not consider the possibility of needing a second swap to ensure the array is in a state where the binary search can find the element correctly. The problem statement guarantees that 2 operations are always sufficient, but the program does not implement this guarantee.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem, specifically in terms of output format and handling multiple swaps.

Final: **False**
