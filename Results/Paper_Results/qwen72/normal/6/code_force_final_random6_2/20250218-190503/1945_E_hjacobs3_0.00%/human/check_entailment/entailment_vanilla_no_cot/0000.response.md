Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to avoid infinite loops or incorrect behavior. Additionally, the binary search should be performed on the entire array, not just the first `n-1` elements.

2. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output as required. The number of operations `k` should be printed on the first line of each test case, followed by `k` lines of operations. The current implementation prints the number of operations inside the function, which is not the correct place.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The program only attempts to swap once if the binary search does not find the correct position. However, the problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed.

4. **Binary Search Result**: The binary search result is not used to determine the correct position of `x` in the array. The program should ensure that after the swaps, the binary search will correctly find `x`.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(len(res))
    for op in res:
        print(' '.join(map(str, op)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    target_index = array.index(find)
    operations = []

    # Perform binary search to find the position where find should be
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid

    # Check if the target is already in the correct position
    if l == target_index:
        return operations

    # If not, try to swap to correct the position
    if l != target_index:
        operations.append((l + 1, target_index + 1))
        array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]

    # Perform binary search again to check if the position is correct
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid

    if l == target_index:
        return operations

    # If not, try one more swap
    for i in range(n):
        if array[i] > find and i < target_index:
            operations.append((i + 1, target_index + 1))
            array[i], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[i]
            break

    return operations
```

This corrected program ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and that the necessary swaps are made to ensure the binary search finds the correct position of `x`. It also correctly formats the output as required by the problem.
