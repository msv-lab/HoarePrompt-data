Reasoning:

The problem requires us to rearrange the elements in a permutation using at most 2 swaps such that a binary search will find the target element `x` at the correct position. The provided program, however, does not perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it directly applies a binary search-like algorithm to the given permutation and then checks if the target element `x` is at the position determined by the binary search. If the element is not at the correct position, it prints the indices that would need to be swapped to place `x` at the correct position.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Binary Search on Unsorted Permutation**: The program attempts to perform a binary search on an unsorted permutation, which is inherently incorrect. Binary search requires the array to be sorted, and the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted.

2. **Incorrect Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The condition `if array[mid] >= find:` should be `if array[mid] <= find:` to correctly narrow down the search range. Additionally, the loop condition should be `while l < r:` instead of `while l <= r:` to avoid infinite loops in certain cases.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the required output format. It prints the number of operations (`print(1)` or `print(0)`) inside the function, which is not part of the function's return value. The function should return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps as specified in the problem description.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads and processes multiple test cases correctly, but the function `func_1` is not designed to handle the required output format for multiple test cases.

Given these issues, the program is not correct according to the problem requirements. It does not perform the necessary swaps and does not output the results in the correct format.

Correctness: **False**
