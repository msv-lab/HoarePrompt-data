Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value among the second largest elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`, and `_` is less than `t`. If `n` == 2, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the current iteration.***
