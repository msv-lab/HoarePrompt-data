Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of `a` of length 3.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` to contain the integers derived from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `_`, and `max`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
