The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

- `a` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers, but the specific values in the list are now updated based on the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `max`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value among the second largest elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`, and `_` is less than `t`.**
