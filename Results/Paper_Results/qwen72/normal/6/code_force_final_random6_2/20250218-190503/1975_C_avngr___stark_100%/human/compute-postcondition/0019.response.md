Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list. If `temp` is not empty and `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.***
