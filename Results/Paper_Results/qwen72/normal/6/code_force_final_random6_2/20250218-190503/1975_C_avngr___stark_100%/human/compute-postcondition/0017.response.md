The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` is already sorted in the initial state, this operation does not change the values of `temp`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list, and `max` remains 0 if `temp` is empty or `temp[1]` is not greater than `max`, otherwise `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`.**
