The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be such that `n - 2` is greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than the initial value of `max`, `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its initial value.**
