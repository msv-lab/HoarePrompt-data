Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than the initial value of `max`, `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its initial value.***
