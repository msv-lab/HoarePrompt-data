The function definition provided does not match the problem description, as the problem involves processing an integer `n` to generate a permutation. The function should take an integer `n` as an argument. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def find_permutation(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.**
