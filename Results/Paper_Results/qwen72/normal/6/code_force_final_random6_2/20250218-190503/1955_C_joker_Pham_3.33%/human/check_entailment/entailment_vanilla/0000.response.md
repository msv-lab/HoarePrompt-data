### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ship, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` becomes zero, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, the ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.

5. **Multiple Ships Case**:
   - If the durability of the first ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship `a[r]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the durability of the last ship is reduced by the first ship's durability.
     - If the last ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk, and the pointer `r` is moved left.
     - The pointer `l` is moved right, and the number of sunk ships is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking any more ships.
   - If the durability of the last ship `a[r]` is less than the durability of the first ship `a[l]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the durability of the first ship is reduced by the last ship's durability.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk, and the pointer `l` is moved right.
     - The pointer `r` is moved left, and the number of sunk ships is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking any more ships.

6. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of ships sunk, which is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The logic for handling the attacks is complex and can be simplified.
- The conditions for breaking the loop are not always clear, which can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

### Simplified Approach:
- The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
- We can simulate the attacks by decrementing the durability of the ships and keeping track of the number of sunk ships.
- If a ship's durability reaches zero, it is removed from the list, and the pointers are adjusted accordingly.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and can produce incorrect results.
- For example, the logic for decrementing `k` and adjusting the pointers is not consistent and can lead to incorrect calculations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be revised to ensure it correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and handles all edge cases.
