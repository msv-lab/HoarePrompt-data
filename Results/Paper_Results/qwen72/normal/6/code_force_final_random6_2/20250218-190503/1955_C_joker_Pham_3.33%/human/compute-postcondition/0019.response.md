Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 2, `sunks` is 1, `k` is `k` - `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n` - 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `sunks`, and the current value of `a[r]` remain unchanged.
- The specific updates to `k` and `a[r]` are still valid as described in the initial state.
