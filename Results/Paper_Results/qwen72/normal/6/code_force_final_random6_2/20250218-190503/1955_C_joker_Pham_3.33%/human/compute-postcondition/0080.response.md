Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[r]` from it.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition `a[l]` <= `a[r]` still holds.
- The updated value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`.
