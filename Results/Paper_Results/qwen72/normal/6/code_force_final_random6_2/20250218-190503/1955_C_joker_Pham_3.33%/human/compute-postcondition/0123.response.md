Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2` and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]` is still valid.
- If `a[l]` was 0 before the if statement, `sunks` is increased by 1, which is now reflected in the output state.
