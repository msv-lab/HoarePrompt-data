You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and a is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1

    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the final value of the left pointer after all iterations, `r` is the final value of the right pointer after all iterations, and `sunks` is the final count of operations performed.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the final count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the final count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
