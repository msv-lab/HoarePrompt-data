### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of ship durabilities.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - The function enters a loop that continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Loop Conditions**:
   - **If `k` is 0**: The loop breaks immediately, as no more attacks can be performed.
   - **If `l` equals `r`**: This means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.
   - **If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`**:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, the Kraken can attack the first ship twice (once from the front and once from the back), reducing `k` by `2 * a[l]` and the durability of the last ship by `a[l]`.
     - If the last ship's durability becomes 0, it sinks, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - The first ship sinks, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`, the Kraken can attack the first ship twice, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.
   - **If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`**:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, the Kraken can attack the last ship twice (once from the back and once from the front), reducing `k` by `2 * a[r]` and the durability of the first ship by `a[r]`.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes 0, it sinks, and the left pointer `l` is incremented.
     - The last ship sinks, and the right pointer `r` is decremented.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1`, the Kraken can attack the last ship twice, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of ships sunk, stored in `sunks`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for simulating the Kraken's attacks is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:
  - The condition `if k == 0` is checked twice in the loop, which is redundant.
  - The logic for handling the case where `l` equals `r` is correct.
  - The logic for handling the case where `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` is correct, but it could be simplified.
  - The logic for handling the case where `a[r]` is less than `a[l]` is correct, but it could also be simplified.

### Simplified Logic:
- The function can be simplified by removing the redundant `if k == 0` checks and ensuring that the loop breaks only when necessary.
- The logic for handling the case where `l` equals `r` is straightforward and correct.
- The logic for handling the case where `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` can be simplified by directly decrementing `k` and adjusting the pointers.
- Similarly, the logic for handling the case where `a[r]` is less than `a[l]` can be simplified.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor redundancy, the program's logic is fundamentally correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
