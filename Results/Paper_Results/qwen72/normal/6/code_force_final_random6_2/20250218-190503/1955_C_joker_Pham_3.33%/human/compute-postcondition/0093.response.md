Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, and `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, with `a[l]` less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` >= `2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` < `2 * a[r]` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k` and `k` > 0 and `l` != `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l` == `r` or if `k` < `2 * a[l]` or `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`.**
