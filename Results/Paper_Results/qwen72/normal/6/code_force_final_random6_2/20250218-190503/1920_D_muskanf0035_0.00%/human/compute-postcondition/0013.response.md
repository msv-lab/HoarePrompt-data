The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 2, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is 2.**
