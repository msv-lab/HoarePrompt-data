Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

# Annotated Functions:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value) such that op_type is 1 or 2, and value is a positive integer. If op_type is 1, then 1 <= value <= n; if op_type is 2, then 1 <= value <= 10^9. queries is a list of positive integers where each integer k satisfies 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `array` is a list that has been modified according to the operations in `operations`, `result` is an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `array` is a list that has been modified according to the operations in `operations`, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`, `queries` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.
    return result
    #The program returns a list `result` containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` has been modified according to the operations specified in the list `operations`, and `queries` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple `(op_type, value)`, and a list of queries. It modifies an internal array based on the operations provided: if `op_type` is 1, it appends `value` to the array; if `op_type` is 2, it duplicates the current array. After processing all operations, it returns a list `result` where each element corresponds to the value at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k` in `queries`. The final state of the program includes a modified `array` and a populated `result` list, while `n` and `operations` remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n and q are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, operations is a list of n lists where each sublist contains two integers b and x with b in {1, 2} and 1 <= x <= n for b=1 and 1 <= x <= 10^9 for b=2, queries is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c) where c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: `t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000 and `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration, `_` is the number of iterations minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of inputs, each set containing the number of operations `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. For each set, it processes the operations and queries using the function `func_1`, and prints the results of the queries. After processing all sets, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the processed results being printed for each set, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reset for the next set of inputs.
