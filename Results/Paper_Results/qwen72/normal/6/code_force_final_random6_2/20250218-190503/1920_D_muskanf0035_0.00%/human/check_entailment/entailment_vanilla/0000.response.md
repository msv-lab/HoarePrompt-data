### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate a series of operations on an array and then answer queries about the elements at specific positions in the array.
   - The operations are:
     - **Type 1:** Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - **Type 2:** Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - The queries ask for the `k`-th element of the array after all operations are performed.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of query positions).
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
     - It iterates through each operation:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself.
     - After all operations, it processes each query by appending the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list.
     - Finally, it returns the `result` list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
     - It reads the operations and queries.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

3. **Identifying Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array can grow very large, especially with type 2 operations. For example, if `x` is large, the array can become impractically large to store in memory.
     - The current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this efficiently. It repeatedly extends the array, which can lead to significant memory usage and slow performance.

   - **Modulo Operation:**
     - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to handle the queries. However, this assumes that the array is cyclic, which is not necessarily true for all operations and queries.
     - For type 2 operations, the array is repeated `x` times, and the modulo operation should take into account the length of the array before the operation and the number of repetitions.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The provided program will work correctly for small inputs and simple cases.
   - However, for large inputs and complex cases, the program will likely fail due to memory constraints and inefficiency in handling the array growth.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct for all inputs as it does not efficiently handle the growth of the array and may run into memory issues or performance bottlenecks. A more efficient approach would be needed to handle large inputs, such as using a segment tree or a different data structure to manage the array and its repetitions.
