### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of tuples representing operations), and `queries` (list of integers representing the k-th element to query).
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
     - It iterates through each operation:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it duplicates the current array `x` times.
     - After processing all operations, it iterates through each query and appends the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
   - **Output:** The function returns the result list, which contains the values of the k-th elements for each query.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** None (reads from standard input).
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
     - It reads `n` lines of operations and `q` integers for queries.
     - It calls `func_1` with the read inputs and prints the results.
   - **Output:** The function prints the results of the queries for each test case.

### Issues with `func_1`:
- **Operation Type 2 Handling:**
  - The current implementation of operation type 2 duplicates the array `x` times, but it does so by extending the array with itself once. This is incorrect because it should extend the array `x` times.
  - **Correct Implementation:**
    ```python
    if op_type == 2:
        array.extend(array * (value - 1))
    ```
  - This change ensures that the array is duplicated `x` times, as required by the problem description.

### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

### Correctness:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The corrected function now correctly handles both types of operations.
  - It appends the value to the array for operation type 1.
  - It duplicates the array `x` times for operation type 2.
  - It correctly computes the k-th element for each query.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case using the corrected `func_1`.
  - It prints the results for each test case as required.

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of operation type 2 in `func_1`.
- After correcting the implementation of operation type 2, the program meets the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but it can be made correct with the suggested changes.)
