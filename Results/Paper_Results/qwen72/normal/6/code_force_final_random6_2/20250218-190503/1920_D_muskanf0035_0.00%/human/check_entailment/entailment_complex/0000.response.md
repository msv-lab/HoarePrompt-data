Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the operations and queries. It then calls `func_1` to process each test case and prints the results.

2. **Operation Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the operations correctly. For type 1 operations, it appends the value to the array. For type 2 operations, it duplicates the array `x` times. This is done using the `extend` method, which is appropriate for appending a list to another list.

3. **Query Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the queries by using the modulo operation to find the element at the specified index. This is necessary because the array can become very large, and the modulo operation ensures that the index is within the bounds of the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` or `q` is 1. For example, if `n` is 1 and the operation is of type 1, the array will contain a single element. If `n` is 1 and the operation is of type 2, the array will still be valid and can be queried.

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a list to store the array and processes the operations and queries in a straightforward manner. However, the problem specifies that the size of the array can be up to `10^18` in the worst case, which is impractical to store in memory. The current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this efficiently and will likely run out of memory for large inputs.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - While the algorithm correctly simulates the operations and queries for small inputs, it is not efficient for large inputs. The problem requires handling up to `10^18` elements, which is not feasible with the current approach of storing the entire array.

Given the above reasoning, the program is **not correct** because it does not handle the large input sizes efficiently and will fail for large test cases.

Correctness: **False**
