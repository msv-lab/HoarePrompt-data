Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a fundamental flaw in the way it handles the second type of operation (b=2). Specifically, the program attempts to append `x` copies of the current array to itself, but it does so in a way that is inefficient and incorrect for large values of `x`.

#### Issues:
1. **Efficiency**: The program uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to append `x` copies of the array to itself. This operation is very inefficient and will lead to a memory overflow for large values of `x` (e.g., \( x \leq 10^9 \)). The array size grows exponentially, which is not feasible for large inputs.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Large `x`**: The program does not handle large values of `x` correctly. For example, if `x` is very large, the array will become extremely large, and the program will not be able to store or process it efficiently.

#### Correct Approach:
To handle large values of `x` efficiently, you should avoid actually constructing the array. Instead, you can use a more mathematical approach to determine the value at the `k`-th position without explicitly constructing the array. This involves keeping track of the size of the array and the values that are repeated.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    size = 0
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
            size += 1
        else:
            size *= value
            if size > 10**18:
                size = 10**18  # Cap the size to avoid overflow
    for k in queries:
        while k > len(array):
            k %= len(array)
            if k == 0:
                k = len(array)
        result.append(array[k - 1])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Array and Size Tracking**: The `array` list is used to store the values added by the first type of operation. The `size` variable is used to keep track of the current size of the array without actually constructing it.

2. **Handling Large `x`**: When a second type of operation is encountered, the size of the array is multiplied by `x`. If the size exceeds \( 10^{18} \), it is capped to \( 10^{18} \) to avoid overflow.

3. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses a loop to reduce the query index `k` modulo the current size of the array until `k` is within the range of the actual stored array. This allows the program to determine the value at the `k`-th position without constructing the entire array.

This approach ensures that the program can handle large values of `x` and `k` efficiently and correctly.
