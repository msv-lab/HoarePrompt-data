Postcondition: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `t[i]` is not 'R'**
