To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` remains the input string.
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers.
   - `a` is the input list of integers.
   - `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`.
   - `k` is the final value after all iterations.
   - `q1` is the final value after all iterations.
   - `q2` is the final value after all iterations.
   - `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, and the last element is the final value of `k`.

2. **Understanding the List `y`:**
   - `y` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the value of `k` at each iteration of the loop.
   - The last element (index `n-1`) is the final value of `k` after all iterations.

3. **What `print(*y)` Does:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `y`, so each element of `y` is printed separated by a space.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be a sequence of `n` numbers, where each number represents the value of `k` at each iteration of the loop, and the last number is the final value of `k`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the list `y`, the output will be a sequence of `n` numbers, each representing the value of `k` at each iteration, including the final value of `k`.

Output: **[k_0] [k_1] ... [k_(n-2)] [k_(n-1)] (where each [k_i] is the value of k at the i-th iteration of the loop, and [k_(n-1)] is the final value of k after all iterations)**
