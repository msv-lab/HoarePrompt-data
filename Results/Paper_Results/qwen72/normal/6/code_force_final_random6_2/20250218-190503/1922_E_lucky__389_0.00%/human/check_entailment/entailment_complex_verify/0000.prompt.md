You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

    #State: `x` is 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers `i` such that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`. `mx` is the maximum integer `i` that was appended to `subseq_lens`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least `len(subseq_lens)` integers, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, and `ansv` now includes the integers at all indices from 1 to `len(subseq_lens) - 1` of `subseq_lens`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #
    #Output:

        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, and `ansv` has been fully printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a new line is printed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `X` from the user input, where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. It then constructs an array of integers such that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array's length is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If no such array can be constructed, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the constructed array followed by the elements of the array on a new line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program should output an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences. However, the program will subtract 1 from `X` and then try to find a combination of subsequence lengths that sum up to `X - 1`. This will lead to incorrect results because the program does not account for the fact that a single element in the array can form an increasing subsequence, and it should not subtract 1 from `X` at the beginning.

For `X = 4`, the correct output should be an array like `[0, 1, 2]`, which has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]`, `[1, 2]`, and `[0, 1, 2]`. However, the program will output an incorrect array.
