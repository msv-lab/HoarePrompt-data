#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers `i` such that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`. `mx` is the maximum integer `i` that was appended to `subseq_lens`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least `len(subseq_lens)` integers, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, and `ansv` now includes the integers at all indices from 1 to `len(subseq_lens) - 1` of `subseq_lens`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the list `ansv`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, and `ansv` has been fully printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a new line is printed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `X` from the user input, where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. It then constructs an array of integers such that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array's length is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If no such array can be constructed, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the constructed array followed by the elements of the array on a new line. The function does not return any value.
