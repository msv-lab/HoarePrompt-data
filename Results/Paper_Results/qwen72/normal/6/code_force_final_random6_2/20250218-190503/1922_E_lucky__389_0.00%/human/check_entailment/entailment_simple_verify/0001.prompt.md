You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be such that it can have exactly \( X \) different increasing subsequences, considering that subsequences with the same elements but different positions are distinct.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to solve the problem.
   - Inside `func_1`, the integer \( x \) is read, and 1 is subtracted from it. This is because the problem considers the empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, and we need to account for it.
   - The program then tries to decompose \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \), subtracting \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \), and recording the length \( i \) of the subsequence.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - The maximum length \( mx \) of these subsequences is tracked to determine the range of the array elements.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Subsequence Counting**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) where the elements are distinct and strictly increasing is \( 2^n \). This is because each element can either be included or excluded in a subsequence.
   - **Decomposition**: The program decomposes \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because any integer \( x \) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and subtracting 1 from each power of 2 allows us to count the increasing subsequences correctly.
   - **Array Construction**: The array is constructed to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \). The elements are chosen to be distinct and in increasing order, which ensures that the subsequences are counted correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( x \) is 0 by breaking out of the loop, which is correct because \( x \) is initially \( X - 1 \).
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array and the array itself.
   - The array elements are in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by decomposing \( X - 1 \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 and constructing an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The array length is within the constraints, and the elements are distinct and in increasing order.

### Correctness:
**True**
