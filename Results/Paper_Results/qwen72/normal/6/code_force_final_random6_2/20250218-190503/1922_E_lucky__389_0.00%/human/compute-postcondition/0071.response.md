Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `X` from the user input, where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. It then constructs an array of integers such that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array's length is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If no such array can be constructed, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the constructed array followed by the elements of the array on a new line. The function does not return any value. **
