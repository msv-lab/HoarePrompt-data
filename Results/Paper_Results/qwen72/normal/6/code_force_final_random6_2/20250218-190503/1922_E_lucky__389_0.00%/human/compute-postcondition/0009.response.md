Output State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 7, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
