Output State: **`i` is the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\), `x` is the input integer minus 1, `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and the final value of `i`, `subseq_lens` is a list that includes the final value of `i`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

The value of `i` remains the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\), and `x` is still the input integer minus 1. The value of `mx` is still the maximum of the previous `mx` and the final value of `i`. The list `subseq_lens` now includes the final value of `i`, and `i` is still not equal to 0.
