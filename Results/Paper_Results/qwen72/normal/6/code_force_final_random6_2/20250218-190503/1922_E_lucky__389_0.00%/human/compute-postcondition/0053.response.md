Output State: **`x` is 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers `i` such that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`. `mx` is the maximum integer `i` that was appended to `subseq_lens`. `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet creates a list `ansv` using a list comprehension.
- `ansv` is populated with integers from 0 to `mx` - 1.
- The initial state values for `x`, `func_1`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged.
- The new list `ansv` is created and its values are specified based on the value of `mx`.
