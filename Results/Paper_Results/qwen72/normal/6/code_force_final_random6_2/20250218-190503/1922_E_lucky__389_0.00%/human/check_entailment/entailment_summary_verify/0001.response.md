### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be such that it can have exactly \( X \) different increasing subsequences, considering that subsequences with the same elements but different positions are distinct.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to solve the problem.
   - Inside `func_1`, the integer \( x \) is read, and 1 is subtracted from it. This is because the problem considers the empty subsequence as an increasing subsequence, and we need to account for it.
   - The program then tries to decompose \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is done by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \), subtracting \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \), and recording the length \( i \) of the subsequence.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.
   - The maximum length \( mx \) of these subsequences is tracked to determine the range of the array elements.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Subsequence Counting**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) where the elements are distinct and strictly increasing is \( 2^n \). This is because each element can either be included or excluded in a subsequence.
   - **Decomposition**: The program decomposes \( x \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because any integer \( x \) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and subtracting 1 from each power of 2 allows us to count the increasing subsequences correctly.
   - **Array Construction**: The array is constructed to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \). The elements are chosen to be distinct and in increasing order, which ensures that the subsequences are counted correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( x \) is 0 by breaking out of the loop, which is correct because \( x \) is initially \( X - 1 \).
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array and the array itself.
   - The array elements are in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is within the problem constraints.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

- **Decomposition Logic**:
  - The decomposition logic is correct. It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \), subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \), and records the length \( i \).
  - This ensures that \( x \) is decomposed into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1, which is a valid approach for constructing the array.

- **Array Construction**:
  - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding integers from 0 to \( mx - 1 \) and then appending the lengths from `subseq_lens`.
  - This construction ensures that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
  - The elements are distinct and in increasing order, which is necessary for the correct counting of subsequences.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where \( x \) is 0 by breaking out of the loop.
  - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by decomposing \( X - 1 \) into a sum of distinct powers of 2 minus 1 and constructing an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The array length is within the constraints, and the elements are distinct and in increasing order.
