The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and/or `x` so that this condition remains true.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must not be 0.
- `i` is 1.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` is true for the next iteration, where `i` will be incremented by 1.

Let's increment `i` by 1 and see if the condition holds:
- `i` becomes 2.
- The condition becomes `2 ** (2 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `2 ** 3 <= x + 1` or `8 <= x + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x + 1` must be greater than or equal to 8, which means `x` must be greater than or equal to 7.

Since `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must not be 0, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 7 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state of `x` must be adjusted to reflect that it is at least 7.

State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 7, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2**.
