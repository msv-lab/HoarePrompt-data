Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `a[i]`. Otherwise, `pergunta` retains its initial value.**
