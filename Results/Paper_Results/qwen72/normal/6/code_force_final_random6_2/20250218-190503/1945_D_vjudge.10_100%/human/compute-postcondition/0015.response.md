Based on the initial state provided:

- `pergunta` is the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than `m`.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `n` is the same.
- `m` is the same.
- `x` is the total minimum cost of bribes for all positions from `n-1` to `0`.

The `print(pergunta)` statement will print the value of `pergunta`.

Since `pergunta` is explicitly defined as the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than `m`, the output will be the value of this minimum cost.

Output: **pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than m)**
