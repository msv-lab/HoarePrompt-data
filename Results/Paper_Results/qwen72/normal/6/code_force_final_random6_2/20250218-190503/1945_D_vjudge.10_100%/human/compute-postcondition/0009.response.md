Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `i` < `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, which is equivalent to `2 * min(a[i], b[i])`.
- The values of `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `pergunta` (if `i` < `m`) is still checked, but `pergunta` remains unchanged unless the condition is met.
