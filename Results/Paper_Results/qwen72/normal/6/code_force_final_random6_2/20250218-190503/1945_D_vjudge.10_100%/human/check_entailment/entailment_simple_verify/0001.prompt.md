You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than m)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be updated to the minimum cost.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the initial value of `pergunta`, the lists `a` and `b`, and the values `n` and `m`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the variable `x` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative cost of bribes.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0 (i.e., from the last person to the first person in the queue).

4. **Bribe Logic:**
   - For each position `i` in the queue:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. This is because Kirill can bribe the person at position `i` to move to a position `j` where `j < i`, and the cost is `a[i]` plus the cumulative cost `x`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This is because Kirill will either bribe the person at position `i` (cost `a[i]`) or pay the person at position `i` for each position `k` such that `j < k < i` (cost `b[i]`).

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the minimum cost `pergunta`.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program seems to correctly implement the idea of calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
- The use of `min(pergunta, x + a[i])` ensures that the minimum cost is updated only when a valid position `i` is found.
- The addition of `min(a[i], b[i])` to `x` ensures that the cumulative cost is correctly calculated based on the cheaper option between bribing the person at position `i` or paying the intermediate positions.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` and `m` are at their maximum values (up to 200,000) and the values in `a` and `b` are at their maximum (up to 10^9).
- It also handles the case where `n` and `m` are small, such as `n = 1` and `m = 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.
