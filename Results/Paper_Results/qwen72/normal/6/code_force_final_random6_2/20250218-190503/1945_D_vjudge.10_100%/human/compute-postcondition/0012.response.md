Postcondition: ***`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `i` < `m`, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.***
