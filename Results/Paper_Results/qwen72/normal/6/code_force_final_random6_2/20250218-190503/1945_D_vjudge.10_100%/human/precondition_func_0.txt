pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n integers where each a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe the i-th person, b is a list of n integers where each b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1 when Kirill moves to position j, n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
