Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, which does not accurately calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization of `pergunta`**: The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good start for finding the minimum cost.
2. **Loop through the queue**: The loop iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, which is intended to simulate Kirill moving forward in the queue.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The line `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is intended to update the minimum cost if Kirill moves to a position `i` that is less than `m`.
   - The line `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is intended to accumulate the cost of moving past the `i`-th person.

However, the logic is flawed because:
- The variable `x` is accumulating the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person, which does not correctly represent the cost of bribing people to move forward.
- The cost to move to a position `j` from `i` should be `a[j]` plus the sum of `b[k]` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`. This is not correctly calculated in the given program.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of moving Kirill to each possible position `j` (where `j < m`).
2. For each position `j`, the cost is `a[j]` plus the sum of `b[k]` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cost(a, b, n, m))

def min_cost(a, b, n, m):
    # Initialize the total cost to a large number
    pergunta = float('inf')
    # Initialize the sum of b values
    b_sum = 0
    # Iterate from the end of the queue to the beginning
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, b_sum + a[i])
        b_sum += b[i]
    return pergunta
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`b_sum`**: This variable keeps track of the cumulative sum of `b` values from the current position `i` to the end of the queue.
- **Cost Calculation**: For each position `i` that is less than `m`, the cost to move Kirill to position `i` is `b_sum + a[i]`. This correctly accounts for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and all the people between `i` and the current position.
- **Update `pergunta`**: The minimum cost is updated by comparing the current minimum cost with the cost of moving to position `i`.

This corrected approach ensures that the minimum cost is accurately calculated for each test case.
