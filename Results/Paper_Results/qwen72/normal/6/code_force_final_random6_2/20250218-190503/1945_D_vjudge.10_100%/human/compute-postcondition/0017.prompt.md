You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n integers where each a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe the i-th person, b is a list of n integers where each b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1 when Kirill moves to position j, n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than `m`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `n` is the same, `m` is the same, and `x` is the total minimum cost of bribes for all positions from `n-1` to `0`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost required to bribe Kirill to a position less than m)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `pergunta`, a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `n`, and an integer `m`. It returns the minimum total cost for Kirill to move to a position not exceeding `m` in the queue, or -1 if it is not possible.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
