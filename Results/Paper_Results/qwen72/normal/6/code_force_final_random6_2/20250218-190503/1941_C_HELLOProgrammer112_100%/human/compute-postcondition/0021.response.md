Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer representing the number of test cases. For each iteration, `a` was an input integer greater than 0, `s` was an input string, `x` was the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`, `y` was the number of times 'pie' appeared in `s`, and `z` was the number of times 'mapie' appeared in `s`. The final output for each test case is the value of `x + y - z`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each of those iterations, the variables `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were set according to the input and the counts of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in the string `s`. The final output for each test case is the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, minus the count of 'mapie'.
