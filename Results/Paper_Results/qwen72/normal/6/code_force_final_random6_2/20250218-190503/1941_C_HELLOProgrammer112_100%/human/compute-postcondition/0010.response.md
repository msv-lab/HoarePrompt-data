Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`.**

The value of `x` is updated to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the new input string `s`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged, as they are still the number of times 'pie' and 'mapie' appear in `s`, respectively. The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.
