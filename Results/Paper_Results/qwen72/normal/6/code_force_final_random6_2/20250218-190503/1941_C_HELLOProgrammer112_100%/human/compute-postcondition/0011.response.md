Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`.**

The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the input string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
