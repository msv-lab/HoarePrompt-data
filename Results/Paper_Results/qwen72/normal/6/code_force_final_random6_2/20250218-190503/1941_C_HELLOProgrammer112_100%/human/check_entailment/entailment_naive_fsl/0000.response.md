Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem of making the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. The logic in the program only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of "mapie". This approach is flawed because it does not consider the positions of these substrings and does not ensure that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
9
mmapnapie
```
The program will output `2` because it counts `1` occurrence of "map" and `1` occurrence of "pie" and subtracts `0` occurrences of "mapie". However, the correct answer should be `3` because removing the characters at positions `1`, `2`, and `8` will make the string "mnape" which is beautiful.

Another example:
```
8
mappppie
```
The program will output `2` because it counts `1` occurrence of "map" and `1` occurrence of "pie" and subtracts `0` occurrences of "mapie". However, the correct answer should be `3` because removing the characters at positions `1`, `2`, and `7` will make the string "mpppie" which is beautiful.

These examples show that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful.
