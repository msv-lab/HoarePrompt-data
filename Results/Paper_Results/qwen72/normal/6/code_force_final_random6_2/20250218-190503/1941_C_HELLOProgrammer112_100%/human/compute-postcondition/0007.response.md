The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the value of `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string.
- `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.
- `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.
- `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is now 1.
- `int(input())` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.**
