Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = int(input())` reassigns the variable `a` to a new input integer.
- The new value of `a` is an input integer greater than 0, as per the initial state requirement.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
