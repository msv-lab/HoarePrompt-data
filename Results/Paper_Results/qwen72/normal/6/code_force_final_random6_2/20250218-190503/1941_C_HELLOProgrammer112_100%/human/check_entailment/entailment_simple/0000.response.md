### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to delete from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The function should process multiple test cases, each with a string of length `n`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `a` (though this is not used in the logic).
   - It then reads the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" (`x`), "pie" (`y`), and "mapie" (`z`).
   - It prints the result of `x + y - z`.

3. **Logic Evaluation:**
   - The logic `x + y - z` is intended to count the number of "map" and "pie" substrings and subtract the overlap "mapie".
   - However, this logic is incorrect because:
     - The substrings "map" and "pie" can overlap in ways that are not captured by `s.count('mapie')`.
     - For example, in the string "mappie", the substrings "map" and "pie" overlap, but `s.count('mapie')` would not count this correctly.
     - Additionally, the function does not account for the fact that removing characters from one substring can affect the presence of another substring.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify and remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
   - One approach is to use a sliding window or a state machine to track the presence of these substrings and count the minimum deletions required.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to count the substrings and calculate the deletions is flawed and does not account for overlapping substrings or the dynamic nature of deletions.

**Correctness: False**
