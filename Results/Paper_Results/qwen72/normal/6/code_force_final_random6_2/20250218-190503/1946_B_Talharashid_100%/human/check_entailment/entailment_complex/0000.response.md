### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` as a list of integers.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The function initializes two variables: `c` to track the current sum of a contiguous subarray and `maxi` to track the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered so far.
   - It iterates over each element in the array `a`:
     - If the element is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, it resets `c` to 0 and updates `maxi` with the maximum of the current `maxi` and `c`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the element to `c` and updates `maxi` with the maximum of the current `maxi` and `c`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - After iterating through the array, it updates `maxi` one last time to ensure it captures the maximum sum of the last contiguous subarray.
   - It then calculates the final result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` and prints it.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function should be defined as `def max_sum_after_operations(t, n, k, a):` to match the problem description. However, the current function `func` does not take any parameters and reads input directly, which is not ideal for testing and reusability.

2. **Contiguous Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays is flawed. The function should find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, not just non-negative elements. This is because the problem allows for the sum of any contiguous subarray to be inserted, including those with negative elements.

3. **Final Formula:**
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `(sum(l) + (2 ** k - 1) * maxi) % 1000000007`. This is because each operation can add the maximum subarray sum to the total sum, and the total sum after `k` operations is the initial sum plus `k` times the maximum subarray sum.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def max_sum_after_operations(t, n, k, a):
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray
        maxi = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            maxi = max(maxi, current_sum)
        
        # Calculate the final result
        total_sum = sum(l)
        result = (total_sum + (2 ** k - 1) * maxi) % 1000000007
        
        print(result)

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program remains as it is.

Given the issues and the corrections needed, the current program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
