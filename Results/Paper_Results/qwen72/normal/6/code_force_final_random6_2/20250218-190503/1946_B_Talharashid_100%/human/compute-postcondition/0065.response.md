Postcondition: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`**
