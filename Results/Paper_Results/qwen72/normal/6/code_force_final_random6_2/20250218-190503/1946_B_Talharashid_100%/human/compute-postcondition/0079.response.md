Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. If `ele` is greater than or equal to 0, `c` is set to `c + ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0.**
