Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is 0, `maxi` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0.
- The initial state specifies that `int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from a new input split by a space with at least 2 elements, and `ele` is the second element of `l`.
- Since `c` is set to 0, the condition "If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0" is now satisfied, so `maxi` remains 0.
- The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged.
