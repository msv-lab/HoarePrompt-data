The value of `c` is incremented by `ele`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element of `l`, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0.**
