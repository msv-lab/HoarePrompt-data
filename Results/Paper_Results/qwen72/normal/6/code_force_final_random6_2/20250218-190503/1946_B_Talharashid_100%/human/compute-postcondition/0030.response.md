Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space, `c` is the cumulative sum of the positive elements in `l` up to the last element processed, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is reassigned to a new list of integers from the input split by a space.
- The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged, but `l` is now a new list based on the most recent input.
