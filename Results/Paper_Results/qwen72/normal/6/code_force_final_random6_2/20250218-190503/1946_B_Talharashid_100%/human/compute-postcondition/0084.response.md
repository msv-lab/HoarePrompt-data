Output State: **`int(input())` is 0, `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space for the last test case, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space for the last test case, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in `l` that are contiguous and not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c` for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The number of remaining test cases (`int(input())`) is 0.
- The loop index `i` has reached the value of `int(input()) - 1`, which is the last index of the loop.
- For the last test case, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input.
- `l` is the list of integers read from the input for the last test case.
- `c` is the cumulative sum of the non-negative elements in `l` that are contiguous and not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c` for the last test case.
