Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `ele` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` and `maxi` remain 0.
- Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `ele` and 0. Since `ele` is not less than 0 in this case, `maxi` will be set to `ele` if `ele` is positive, or 0 if `ele` is 0.
- The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged.
