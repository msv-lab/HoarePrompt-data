Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is `ele` + the previous value of `c`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. The new value of `maxi` is now the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
