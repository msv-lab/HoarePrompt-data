Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `c` is `ele` + the previous value of `c`, `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by `ele`.
- The value of `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `ele` and 0.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
