Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space.** 

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space. After executing the code snippet, the variable `l` is assigned a list of integers derived from the input split by a space. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
