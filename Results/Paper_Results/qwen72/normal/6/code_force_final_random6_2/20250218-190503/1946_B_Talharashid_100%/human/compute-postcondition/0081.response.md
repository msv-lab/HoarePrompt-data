Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` that are not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial condition that `int(input())` is greater than 1 remains unchanged.
- The variables `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `l` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `c` will be the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` that are not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
- The variable `maxi` will be the maximum value that `c` has ever reached during the loop execution. If a negative element in the list `l` causes `c` to reset to 0, `maxi` will still retain the highest value `c` had before the reset.
