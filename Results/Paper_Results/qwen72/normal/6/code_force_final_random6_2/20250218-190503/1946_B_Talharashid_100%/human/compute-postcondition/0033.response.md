The only objects in the loop head are `ele` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space, and `ele` is the first element of `l`.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element of `l`**
