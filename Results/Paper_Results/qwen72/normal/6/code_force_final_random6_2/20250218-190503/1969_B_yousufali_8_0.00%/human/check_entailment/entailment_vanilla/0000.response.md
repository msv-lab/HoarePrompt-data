### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of these operations.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process a single binary string.
   - It reads the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input is a string of binary characters.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `n` for each 1.
   - If it encounters a 0 and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times and calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Issues**:
   - **Input Handling in `func_1`**: The input is read as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which is incorrect for a binary string. It should be read as a string using `input()`.
   - **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The correct approach should consider the positions of 1s and 0s to determine the minimum cost to sort the string.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To sort a binary string in non-descending order, we need to move all 1s to the right of all 0s.
   - The minimum cost to achieve this can be calculated by finding the number of 1s to the left of each 0 and summing these values.
   - This is because each 1 to the left of a 0 needs to be moved to the right of the 0, and the cost of moving a 1 to the right of a 0 is the length of the substring from the 1 to the 0.

6. **Corrected Function 1**:
   - Read the input as a string.
   - Initialize `n` to count the number of 1s.
   - Initialize `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - Iterate through the string, increment `n` for each 1, and add `n + 1` to `ans` for each 0 if `n` is not zero.
   - Print `ans`.

7. **Corrected Function 2**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - Iterate `t` times and call the corrected `func_1` for each test case.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        elif s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to improper input handling and flawed logic.
- The corrected program correctly reads the input as a string and calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

**Correctness: False**
