The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to adjust `t`.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `t - 1` again. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` must be greater than 1 to ensure that after decrementing, it is still greater than 0.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 1**
