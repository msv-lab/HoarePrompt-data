Output State: **`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 + `n` + 1 if `s[1]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, or `ans` is 0 + `n` + 1 if `s[1]` is 1. If `s[2]` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms:
- `s` remains a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least 3 elements.
- `i` remains 2.
- `ans` is updated to `ans` + `n` + 1.
- If `s[2]` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1.
