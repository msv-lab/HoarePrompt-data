The code snippet calls the function `func_1()`, but there is no information provided about what `func_1()` does or how it affects the variables. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 1, we can only assume that `t` has already been decremented by 1 and is still greater than 1. Without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we cannot determine if it changes `t` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the assumption that `func_1()` does not alter `t`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 1**
