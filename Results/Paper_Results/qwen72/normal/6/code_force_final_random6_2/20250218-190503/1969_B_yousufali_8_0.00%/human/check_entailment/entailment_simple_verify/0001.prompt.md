You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:

    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it reads a binary string `s` from the input, where `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s), and `n` and `ans` are initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:

        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s), `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that comes after at least one 1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated as described above.
    #
    #Output:

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1` without passing any arguments.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
     - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string:
       - If the current character is `1`, it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
     - The function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. The input should be read as a single string, not split into a list.
     - The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - **Conversion to List of Integers:**
     - The function converts the string to a list of integers using `list(map(int, s))`. This is correct, but it should be `list(map(int, s))` or `list(map(int, list(s)))` if `s` is a string.
   - **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
     - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The cost should be calculated based on the number of 1s that need to be moved to the left of 0s, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
     - The correct approach is to find the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost based on these transitions.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a binary string to be sorted in non-descending order, all `1`s should be to the right of all `0`s.
   - The minimum cost to achieve this is the length of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s that needs to be moved to the right of all `0`s.
   - This can be calculated by finding the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and then summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in input handling and the logic for calculating the cost. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
