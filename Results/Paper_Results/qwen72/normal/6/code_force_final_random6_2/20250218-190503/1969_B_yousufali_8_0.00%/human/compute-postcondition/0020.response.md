Output State: **`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s), `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that comes after at least one 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`s`**: The list `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be the index of the last element in the list, which is `len(s) - 1`.
- **`n`**: The variable `n` counts the number of 1s in the list `s`. Each time a 1 is encountered, `n` is incremented by 1.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` is incremented by `n + 1` each time a 0 is encountered in the list `s` and `n` is not 0. This means `ans` accumulates the value `n + 1` for each 0 that appears after at least one 1 in the list. If there are no 0s after any 1s, `ans` remains 0.
