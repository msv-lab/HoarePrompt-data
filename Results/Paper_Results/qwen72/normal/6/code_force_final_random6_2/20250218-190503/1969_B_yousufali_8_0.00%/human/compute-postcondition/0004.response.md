The provided code snippet calls the function `func_1()`, but there is no information about what `func_1()` does. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific impact on the variables or the program state. However, the initial state specifies that `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. Since the function call does not provide any new information about `t` or any other variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0**
