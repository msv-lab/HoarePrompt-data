The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body, it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
