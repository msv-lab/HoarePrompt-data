Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is now `t - 1`, `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers, `k` is the last integer in the iterator returned by `R()` and must be at least 2, `a` is a set containing integers read from the input for the current test case, `b` is a set containing integers read from the input for the current test case, `f` is 1 if either `1` is in `a` or `1` is in `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is equal to `k // 2 - (u and not v)`, `n` is equal to `k // 2 - 1` if `1` is not in `a` and `1` is in `b`, otherwise `n` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `u` is `True` if `2` is in `a`, otherwise `False`, `v` is `True` if `2` is in `b`, otherwise `False`**

Explanation: The value of `v` is updated to `True` if `2` is in `b`, otherwise it is `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
