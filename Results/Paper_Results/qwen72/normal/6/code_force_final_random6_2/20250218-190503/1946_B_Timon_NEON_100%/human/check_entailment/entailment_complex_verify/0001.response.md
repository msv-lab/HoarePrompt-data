### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is a correct implementation for the modulo operation.
     - **Correctness:** True

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
     - It iterates through the array and updates `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
     - After the loop, it appends the final segments to `segments_variants`.
     - It then iterates through `segments_variants` to find the segment with the maximum sum.
     - **Issues:**
       - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists with a single element, which can lead to incorrect indexing and logic.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is negative.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty or has only one element.
       - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` when transitioning between positive and negative elements.
     - **Correctness:** False

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is intended to calculate the final answer based on the maximum segment sum and the number of operations.
     - However, the function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to compute the final result.
     - The function initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to update it.
     - **Correctness:** False

3. **Using the Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_2` is not correctly implemented:
     - It incorrectly handles the transition between positive and negative elements.
     - It does not handle the case where the entire array is negative.
     - It does not handle the case where the array is empty or has only one element.
   - The main logic in the annotated code also has issues:
     - It uses `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` to calculate the final answer, which is incorrect.
     - The correct approach should be to use the maximum subarray sum to update the array sum after `k` operations.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then using this sum to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.
   - The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum, the final array sum can be calculated as:
     - If the maximum subarray sum is non-negative, the final sum is the original array sum plus the maximum subarray sum multiplied by `k`.
     - If the maximum subarray sum is negative, the final sum is just the original array sum (since adding a negative sum multiple times will not increase the total sum).
   - The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incorrect because:
     - `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
     - The main logic for calculating the final answer is incorrect.
     - `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations.

### Final: **False**
