Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or remains as `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0]. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[1], 1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[0], 0]`, or to `[arr[0] + 2 * arr[1], 1]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`, or to `[2 * arr[1], 1]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[1], 1]`. `segments_variants` is either a list containing `[0, 0, -1]` or a list containing `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is updated to either `[arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or `[arr[0] + arr[2], 0]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative. `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`. If `arr[2]` is negative, `new_segment` is an empty list. If `arr[2]` is non-negative, `new_segment` is updated to `[new_segment[0] + arr[2], 2]` if `new_segment` was previously set, or `new_segment` is `[arr[2], 2]` if it was not previously set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
