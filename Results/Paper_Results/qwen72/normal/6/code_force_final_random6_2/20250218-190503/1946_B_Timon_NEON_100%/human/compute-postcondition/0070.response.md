Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a segment from the list that has the highest sum of non-negative elements, provided the segment contains more than one element. The segment is represented as a list containing the sum of the segment, the starting index, and the ending index. If no such segment exists, the function returns `[-1]`. **
