Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of the `max_segment` list by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it.
- Initially, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, and `i` is 1.
- After the code execution, `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
