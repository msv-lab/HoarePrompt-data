### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The solution should handle multiple test cases, each with different values of `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(number)`**:
     - This function returns the result of `number % 1000000007`, which is correct for handling the modulo operation as required by the problem.
   - **`func_2(arr)`**:
     - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, the logic is flawed and does not correctly identify the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
     - The function maintains a list of segments and their sums, but it does not consider the optimal way to insert the sum of subarrays multiple times.
     - The function also has issues with handling negative numbers and empty segments, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - **`func_3(number, quantity)`**:
     - According to the function summary, `func_3` always returns `0`, regardless of the input parameters. This is clearly incorrect for the problem at hand, as the function should be involved in calculating the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
     - The function does not perform any meaningful computation and is essentially a placeholder.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
     - `func_3` is not implemented and always returns `0`.
     - There is no function to handle the input and output as specified.
     - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - These points are accurate. The program is indeed incomplete and does not solve the problem correctly.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the test case `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `arr = [1, 1]`:
     - The correct output should be `4` (since you can take the entire array and insert its sum twice, resulting in `[1, 1, 2, 2]` with a sum of `6` modulo `10^9 + 7`).
     - However, the current implementation in `func_2` does not handle this correctly, and `func_3` always returns `0`, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to handle the problem as described. The function `func_3` is not implemented correctly, and `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Additionally, there is no function to handle the input and output as specified in the problem description.
