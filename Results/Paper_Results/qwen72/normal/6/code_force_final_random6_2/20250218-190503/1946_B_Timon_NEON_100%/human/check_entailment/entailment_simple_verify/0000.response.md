### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function correctly returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function is intended to find the maximum segment of non-negative elements in the array.
     - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not correctly identify the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
     - The function only considers segments of non-negative elements and does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of a segment that includes negative elements.
     - The function also appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are not valid segments, which can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function returns `[-1]` if no valid segment is found, which is not the correct approach for the problem.

   - **Main Loop**:
     - The main loop reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment.
     - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
     - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - The formula used is incorrect. The correct approach should involve calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, which is not achieved by simply multiplying the maximum segment sum by \(2^k\).

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case where `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `arr = [1, 1]`.
   - The correct output should be `4` (since you can take the entire array and insert its sum twice, resulting in `[1, 1, 2, 2]` with a sum of `6` modulo \(10^9 + 7\)).
   - The current implementation does not handle this correctly because it only considers non-negative segments and uses an incorrect formula to calculate the final answer.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and the formula used in the main loop is incorrect.
   - The program does not handle all possible cases, especially those involving negative elements and the correct calculation of the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
