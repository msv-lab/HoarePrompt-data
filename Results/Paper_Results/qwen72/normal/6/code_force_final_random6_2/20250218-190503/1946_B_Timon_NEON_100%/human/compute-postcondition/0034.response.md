Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`, `new_segment` is either `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or an empty list if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative, and `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `new_segment` is not empty.***
