Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0]. If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`.***
