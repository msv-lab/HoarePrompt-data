### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to perform `k` operations on an array `a` of length `n`.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function takes a number and returns its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is a simple and correct implementation for the modulo operation.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are initialized incorrectly.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array ends with a positive number.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum sum and indices.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to perform the operations or compute the result.

5. **Overall Program:**
   - The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem.
   - The `func_2` function is not correctly implemented to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - The `func_3` function is incomplete and does not perform the required operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem and contains flawed implementations of the helper functions.

**Correctness: False**
