Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`. `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`. `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative elements, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment, with the last element being `max_segment` followed by `len(arr) - 1`. The `new_segment` list is appended to `segments_variants` with the ending index `len(arr) - 1`. `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least one element, `segment` is the first element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least two elements, and `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least three elements, and `segment` is the third element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, `total_max_segment` is updated to be the third element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
