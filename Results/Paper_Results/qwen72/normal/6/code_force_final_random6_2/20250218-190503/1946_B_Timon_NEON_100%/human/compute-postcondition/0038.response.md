Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `new_segment` is non-empty, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or remains as `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0]. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[1], 1]` if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list. `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[0], 0]`, or to `[arr[0] + 2 * arr[1], 1]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`, or to `[2 * arr[1], 1]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[1], 1]`. `segments_variants` is either a list containing `[0, 0, -1]` or a list containing `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`.***
