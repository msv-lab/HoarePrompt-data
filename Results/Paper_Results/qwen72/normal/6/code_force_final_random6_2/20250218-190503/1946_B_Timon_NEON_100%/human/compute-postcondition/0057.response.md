To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `segment` and `segments_variants`. The loop will execute if `segments_variants` is not empty. Let's break down the state adjustments needed:

1. **`segments_variants` must not be empty**: For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must contain at least one element. This is crucial because the loop iterates over `segments_variants`.

2. **Initial state of `segment`**: When the loop starts, `segment` will take the value of the first element in `segments_variants`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `max_sum` is -1
- `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`
- `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative elements, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment, with the last element being `max_segment` followed by `len(arr) - 1`
- `new_segment` list is appended to `segments_variants` with the ending index `len(arr) - 1`
- `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`

To ensure the loop executes, `segments_variants` must have at least one element. The initial state of `segment` will be the first element in `segments_variants`.

State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least one element, `segment` is the first element in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`**
