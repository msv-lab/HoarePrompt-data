You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is a correct implementation for the modulo operation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
     - It iterates through the array and updates `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
     - After the loop, it appends the final segments to `segments_variants`.
     - It then iterates through `segments_variants` to find the segment with the maximum sum.
     - However, there are several issues with this function:
       - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists with a single element, which can lead to incorrect indexing and logic.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is negative.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty or has only one element.
       - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` when transitioning between positive and negative elements.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is intended to calculate the final answer based on the maximum segment sum and the number of operations.
     - However, the function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to compute the final result.
     - The function initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to update it.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then using this sum to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.
   - The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum, the final array sum can be calculated as:
     - If the maximum subarray sum is non-negative, the final sum is the original array sum plus the maximum subarray sum multiplied by `k`.
     - If the maximum subarray sum is negative, the final sum is just the original array sum (since adding a negative sum multiple times will not increase the total sum).
   - The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incorrect because:
     - `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
     - `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations.
