Let's analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- If `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`.
- If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`.
- Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`.
- If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`.
- Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0].
- If `arr[1]` is less than 0, `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`.

Code Snippet:
```
max_segment[0] += arr[i]
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `max_sum` is -1.
   - `max_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` or `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]` or `[arr[1], 1]` depending on the values of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.
   - `new_segment` is either `[arr[1], 1]` or an empty list depending on the value of `arr[1]`.
   - `segments_variants` is either a list containing `[0, 0, -1]` or a list containing `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it.
   - Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`.

3. **Calculations**:
   - If `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, then `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
   - If `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`, then `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[1]` which simplifies to `arr[0] + 2 * arr[1]`.
   - If `max_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`, then `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[1] + arr[1]` which simplifies to `2 * arr[1]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `max_segment` is updated based on the initial value of `max_segment[0]`:
     - If `max_segment` was `[arr[0], 0]`, it becomes `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`.
     - If `max_segment` was `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`, it becomes `[arr[0] + 2 * arr[1], 1]`.
     - If `max_segment` was `[arr[1], 1]`, it becomes `[2 * arr[1], 1]`.
   - `new_segment` remains either `[arr[1], 1]` or an empty list depending on the value of `arr[1]`.
   - `segments_variants` remains either a list containing `[0, 0, -1]` or a list containing `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[0], 0]`, or to `[arr[0] + 2 * arr[1], 1]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`, or to `[2 * arr[1], 1]` if `max_segment` was `[arr[1], 1]`, `new_segment` is either `[arr[1], 1]` or an empty list depending on the value of `arr[1]`, `segments_variants` is either a list containing `[0, 0, -1]` or a list containing `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`.**
