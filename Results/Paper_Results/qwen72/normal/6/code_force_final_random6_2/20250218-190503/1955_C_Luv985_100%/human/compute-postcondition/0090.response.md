Postcondition: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, the current value of `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by 1. Additionally, the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
