Postcondition: **`l` is equal to `r`, `k` is 0 or less than 2, `ans` is the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0 during the loop execution, `a` is a list of integers where elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero. `T` is decreased by the number of iterations the loop ran.**
