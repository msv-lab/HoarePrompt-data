Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0 or 1, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `l`, `r`, `k`, `ans`, `T`, `a`, `mi`, and `t` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
