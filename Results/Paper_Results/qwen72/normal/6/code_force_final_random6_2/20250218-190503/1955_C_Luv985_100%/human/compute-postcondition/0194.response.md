Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.**

The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so it is now either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
