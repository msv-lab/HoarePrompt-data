To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `k > 0`.

### Initial State:
- `T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer).
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer).
- `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Head Conditions:
1. `l < r`
2. `k > 0`

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1: `l < r`**
  - `l` is 0.
  - `r` is `n - 1`.
  - For `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than `l`. Therefore, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

- **Condition 2: `k > 0`**
  - `k` is the second integer from the input split by space.
  - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be a positive integer.

### Adjustments:
- **`n` must be greater than 1**: This ensures that `r` (which is `n - 1`) is greater than `l` (which is 0).
- **`k` must be greater than 0**: This ensures that the second condition in the loop head is satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**
