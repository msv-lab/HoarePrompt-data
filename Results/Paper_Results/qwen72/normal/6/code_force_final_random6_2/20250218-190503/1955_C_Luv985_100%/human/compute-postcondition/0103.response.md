Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `a[l]` (which is `a[0]` since `l` is 0) is decreased by `mi`. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, and `mi`) remain unchanged.
