You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of pairs (n, k), and a list of lists a. t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each pair (n, k) in the list of pairs consists of integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively. Each list in a contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists a should be equal to t. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `T` is 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. For each test case, `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is greater than `r`, and `k` is 0 or less than 2. `ans` is the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0 during the loop execution, plus 1 if `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`. The list `a` is modified such that elements that have been reduced to 0 are 0, and the remaining elements are non-zero.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a` and converts each element to an integer.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the first and last indices of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as `l` is less than `r` and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi`).
   - If the total number of attacks (2 * `mi`) is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `mi` and decreases `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If the durability of the first ship becomes zero, it increments the `ans` counter and moves the `l` pointer to the next ship.
   - If the durability of the last ship becomes zero, it increments the `ans` counter and moves the `r` pointer to the previous ship.
   - If the total number of attacks (2 * `mi`) is greater than `k`, it calculates the remaining attacks (`k % 2` and `k // 2`), and checks if the first ship will sink after the remaining attacks. If so, it increments the `ans` counter and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Single Ship Case:**
   - If `l` equals `r` (i.e., only one ship is left), the program checks if the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to the durability of the remaining ship. If so, it increments the `ans` counter.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- It correctly updates the durability of the ships and the number of remaining attacks.
- The program also correctly handles the case where only one ship is left and checks if it will sink.

### Edge Cases:

- **All Ships Sink:**
  - If all ships sink before the Kraken runs out of attacks, the program will correctly count all sunk ships.
- **No Ships Sink:**
  - If the Kraken runs out of attacks before any ship sinks, the program will correctly output 0.
- **Single Ship:**
  - If there is only one ship, the program correctly checks if it will sink based on the remaining attacks.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the alternating attacks, updates the durabilities, and counts the number of sunk ships accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
