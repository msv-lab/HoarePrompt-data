Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(k - q)` statement.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 2 (though this value is not used in the given code snippet).
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - If `k` is not a power of 2, then:
     - `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
     - `p` is the length of `l`.
     - `q` is \(2\) raised to the power of \((p - 1)\).

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - We need to calculate \(k - q\).

Let's go through the steps with an example:

### Example:
- Suppose `n = 10` and `m = 6`.
- Then \(k = |10 - 6| = 4\).

Since \(k = 4\) is a power of 2, the conditions for calculating `l`, `p`, and `q` are not met. Therefore, we need to consider a different example where \(k\) is not a power of 2.

### Example:
- Suppose `n = 10` and `m = 7`.
- Then \(k = |10 - 7| = 3\).

Since \(k = 3\) is not a power of 2, we proceed with the calculations:
- The binary representation of \(3\) is `11`.
- The length of `11` is \(p = 2\).
- \(q\) is \(2^{(p - 1)} = 2^{(2 - 1)} = 2^1 = 2\).

Now, we calculate \(k - q\):
- \(k - q = 3 - 2 = 1\).

### General Case:
- For any \(k\) that is not a power of 2, the binary representation of \(k\) will have more than one '1' bit.
- The length \(p\) of the binary representation of \(k\) will be the number of bits in the binary form of \(k\).
- \(q\) will be \(2^{(p - 1)}\), which is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).

The value of \(k - q\) will be the difference between \(k\) and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).

### Final Output:
- The `print(k - q)` statement will print the value of \(k - q\), where \(k\) is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and \(q\) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).

Output: **k - q (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and q is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k)**
