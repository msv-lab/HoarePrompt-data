The only variables in the loop head are `i`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input integer provided to `range(int(input()))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional changes are made. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0, no additional changes are made, regardless of whether `m` is an odd or even integer greater than 0. Otherwise, `l` is a string representing the binary value of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**
