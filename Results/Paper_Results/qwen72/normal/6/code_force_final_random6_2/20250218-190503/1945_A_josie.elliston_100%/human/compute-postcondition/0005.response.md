Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.**

In natural language: The program calculates the sum of `extroverts` and `universals`, divides this sum by 3, and then returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of this division. This means that if the division result is a decimal, it will round up to the next whole number. If the division result is already a whole number, it will return that number.
