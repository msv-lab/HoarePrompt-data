The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, so the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next element in `arr` for the loop to execute one more time. The length of `arr` is `n`, and the loop can continue as long as there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element of `arr`.
- `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `freq[i]` is now 2.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be adjusted to the third element of `arr` (if `arr` has at least 3 elements).
- `arr` must have at least 3 elements to ensure there is a next element to iterate over.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `freq[i]` is now 2**
