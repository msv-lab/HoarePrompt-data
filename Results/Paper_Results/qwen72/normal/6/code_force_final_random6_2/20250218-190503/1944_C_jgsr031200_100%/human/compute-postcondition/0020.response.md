The loop head contains the variables `i` and the implicit variable `n`. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted as it is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `arr` and is not modified within the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `cou` remains 0**
