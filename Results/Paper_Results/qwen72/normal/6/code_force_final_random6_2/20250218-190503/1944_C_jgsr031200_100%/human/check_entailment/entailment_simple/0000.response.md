Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the MEX of an array `c` that is constructed by Alice and Bob taking turns to pick and remove elements from the array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it. The given program attempts to solve this problem by tracking the frequency of each integer in the array `a` and then determining the MEX based on the frequencies.

Let's break down the program and check its correctness:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   ```python
   freq = [0] * (n + 1)
   for i in arr:
       freq[i] += 1
   ```
   This part correctly calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `arr`. Since the integers in `arr` are non-negative and less than `n`, the frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` is appropriate.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   ```python
   cou = 0
   for i in range(n + 1):
       if freq[i] >= 2:
           continue
       
       if freq[i] == 1:
           cou += 1
       
       if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
           print(i)
           break
   ```
   This part of the program is intended to find the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob construct. The logic is as follows:
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice in `arr`, it will be picked by both players, so it doesn't affect the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it will be picked by one of the players, and the counter `cou` is incremented.
   - If the counter `cou` reaches 2, it means that two unique integers have been picked, and the MEX will be the next integer `i` that is not in the array.
   - If an integer `i` is not in the array (`freq[i] == 0`), it is the MEX.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program assumes that the MEX will be found when `cou` reaches 2 or when `freq[i]` is 0. This is not always correct. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`, and the program should consider the optimal strategy of both players.

### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice will always pick the smallest integer that is not in `c` and has a frequency of 1 in `arr` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will always pick the smallest integer that is not in `c` and has a frequency of 1 in `arr` to minimize the MEX.

Given this, the correct approach should be:
- Track the smallest integer that is not in `c` and has a frequency of 1 in `arr`.
- If both players play optimally, the MEX will be the smallest integer that is not in `c` after all elements are picked.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        elif freq[i] == 1:
            mex += 1
    else:
        print(mex)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- We initialize `mex` to 0.
- We iterate through the frequency array `freq` from 0 to `n`.
- If `freq[i]` is 0, it means `i` is the MEX, and we print it and break the loop.
- If `freq[i]` is 1, it means `i` will be picked by one of the players, so we increment `mex`.
- If we complete the loop without finding a 0 in `freq`, the MEX is the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
