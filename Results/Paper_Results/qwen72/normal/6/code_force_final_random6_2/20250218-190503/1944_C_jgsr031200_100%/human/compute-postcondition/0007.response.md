Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged. The list `freq` now contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`. Specifically, `freq[i]` will be the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. The length of `freq` is `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
