Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is the first index in `freq` where `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` reaches 2. If `cou` reaches 2, the loop prints the value of `i` at which `cou` reaches 2. If `freq[i]` is 0 before `cou` reaches 2, the loop prints `i` and breaks. Otherwise, `cou` is the number of unique integers in `arr` that appear exactly once, and the loop has completed all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `freq` list from 0 to `n`.
- If `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` reaches 2, the loop prints `i` and breaks.
- If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues until it either prints and breaks or completes all iterations.
- After all iterations, `i` will be the index where the loop stopped, either because `freq[i]` was 0 or `cou` reached 2, or it will be `n` if the loop completed without breaking.
- `cou` will be the number of unique integers in `arr` that appear exactly once, or it will be less than 2 if the loop broke due to `freq[i]` being 0.
