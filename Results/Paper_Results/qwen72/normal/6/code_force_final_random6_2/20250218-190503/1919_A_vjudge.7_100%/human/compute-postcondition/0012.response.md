Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `test` must be greater than 1, and `t` is 1. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the condition also holds.*** 

(Note: Since the if and else parts do not modify the variables or have any specific return values, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.)
