Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- `test` must be greater than 1.
- `t` is 1.
- The condition for the `print` statement to execute is that the sum of `a` and `b` must be either even or odd.

### Analysis:
- The condition "the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds" and "the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the condition also holds" means that the condition will always be true regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.
- Since the condition is always true, the `print` statement will always execute.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Output:
The `print` statement will always print the string 'Alice' because the condition described in the initial state is always true.

Output: **Alice**
