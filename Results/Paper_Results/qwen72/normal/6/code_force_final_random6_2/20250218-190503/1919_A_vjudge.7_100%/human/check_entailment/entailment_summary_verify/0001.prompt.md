You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `test` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, the state includes the number of test cases processed and the results printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins in both wallets combined.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the first move, and if the total number of coins is even, Bob will always have the last move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice will have the last move, and Bob will be the one who cannot make a valid move when the total number of coins is odd.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Bitwise AND Operator:**
   - The expression `a + b & 1` is used to check the parity of the sum.
   - `a + b` gives the total number of coins.
   - `a + b & 1` checks if the least significant bit of the sum is 0 (even) or 1 (odd).
   - If the result is 0, the sum is even, and Bob wins.
   - If the result is 1, the sum is odd, and Alice wins.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where both wallets have 1 coin each, which is correctly identified as a win for Bob.
   - It also handles cases where the total number of coins is large (up to \(10^9\)), which is within the constraints.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The logic is sound and matches the optimal play strategy.
