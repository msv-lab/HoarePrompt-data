Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the problem description. The logic of the program determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins. This is because, in an optimal play, the player with the turn when the total number of coins is even will always be forced into a losing position, as they will eventually be the one to make the last move that results in both wallets being empty. Conversely, when the total number of coins is odd, the player with the turn can always force the opponent into a position where the total number of coins becomes even, thus winning the game. The program correctly implements this logic and will produce the correct output for the given input constraints.
