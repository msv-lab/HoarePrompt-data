Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is equal to `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `g = n / count` updates the value of `g` to `n / 2` because `count` is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
