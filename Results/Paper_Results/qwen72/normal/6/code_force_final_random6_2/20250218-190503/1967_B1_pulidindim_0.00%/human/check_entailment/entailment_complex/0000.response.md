Reasoning:

The provided function `func` is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement. However, the implementation of the function does not correctly solve the problem for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is not the correct starting point for counting valid pairs. The correct initialization should be `0` since we are counting pairs that meet specific conditions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over `count` starting from `2` and increments by `1` until `count` exceeds `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, and `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is used to break the loop, but this condition is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly reflect the conditions for valid pairs.
   - The update to `ans` using `ans += g / count + 1` is also incorrect. The formula used here does not match the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Misinterpretation of the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not correctly check this condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the first test case with \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), and the function correctly prints `1`.
   - For the fourth test case with \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the function is supposed to print `14`, but the current logic does not correctly compute this value.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
