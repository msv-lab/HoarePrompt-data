Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / 2 - 1`. If `g` < `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1.
- `g` was initially `n / 2`, so after the decrement, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `if g < countmins` is still in effect, and it will break the most internal loop or if statement if `g` is less than 1.
