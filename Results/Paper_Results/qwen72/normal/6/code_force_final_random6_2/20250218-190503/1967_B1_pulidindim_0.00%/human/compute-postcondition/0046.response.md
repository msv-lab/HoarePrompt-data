Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is equal to `n / 2 - 1`. `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation:
- `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`.
- Given that `count` is 3, `countmins` becomes 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, and `g`) retain their initial values or conditions.
