Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of values added in each iteration, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.**

Natural language explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user.
- The value of `t` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `count` remains `m + 1`.
- The value of `ans` remains the sum of `n` and the series of values added in each iteration.
- The value of `countmins` remains `m - 1`.
- The value of `g` remains the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)`.
- The condition for breaking the loop (if `g` is less than `countmins`) remains unchanged.
