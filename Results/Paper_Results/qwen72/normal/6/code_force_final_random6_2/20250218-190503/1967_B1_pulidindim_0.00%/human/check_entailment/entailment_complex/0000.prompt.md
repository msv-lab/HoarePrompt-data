Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user for each iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1` for each iteration, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of values added in each iteration where `g` is `n / count - (count - 1)`, `countmins` is `m - 1` for each iteration, and `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)` for each iteration. If `g` is less than `countmins` for any iteration, the loop breaks for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then performs a series of calculations to compute a value `ans` based on `n` and `m`. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. After all iterations, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user for each test case. The function does not return any value.
