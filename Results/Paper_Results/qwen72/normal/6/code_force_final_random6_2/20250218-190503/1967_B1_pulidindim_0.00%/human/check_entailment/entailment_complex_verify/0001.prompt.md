You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

Output

    3
    4

    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user for each iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1` for each iteration, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of values added in each iteration where `g` is `n / count - (count - 1)`, `countmins` is `m - 1` for each iteration, and `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)` for each iteration. If `g` is less than `countmins` for any iteration, the loop breaks for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then performs a series of calculations to compute a value `ans` based on `n` and `m`. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. After all iterations, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then enters a loop where `count` is incremented from 2 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It calculates `g` as \(n / \text{count}\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds \((g / \text{count}) + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to \(n\), which is incorrect. The correct initial value should be 0 because we are counting pairs.
   - The loop starts from `count = 2` and increments `count` by 1 until it reaches \(m\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is used to break the loop, but this condition is not clearly justified in the context of the problem.
   - The update `ans += g / count + 1` is also not clearly justified and seems to be incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition.
   - However, this approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach involves using properties of the gcd and modular arithmetic.

5. **Efficient Solution:**
   - For a given \(b\), we need to find all \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be simplified to finding all \(a\) such that \(a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - For each \(b\), we can iterate over all possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and count the valid \(a\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - The initialization of `ans` and the loop conditions are incorrect.
   - The program does not correctly count the valid pairs.
