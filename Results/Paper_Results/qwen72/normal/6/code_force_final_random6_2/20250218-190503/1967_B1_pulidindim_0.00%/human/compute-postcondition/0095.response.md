The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or require external inputs or variables `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we cannot definitively state what the function returns. However, typically in such functions, the return value might be a result of some computation involving `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function implicitly uses or requires two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns a value based on some computation involving these integers.**
