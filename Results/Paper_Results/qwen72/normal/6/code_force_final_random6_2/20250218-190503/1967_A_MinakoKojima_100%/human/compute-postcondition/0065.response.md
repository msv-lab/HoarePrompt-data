Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus the sum of all differences `dif` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution. If `k` is not 0, `ans` is further increased by the integer division of `k` by `n`, and `res` is the initial value of `n - 1` minus the number of times `res` was decremented during the loop execution plus the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. If `k` is 0, `ans` and `res` retain their values from the loop execution.***
