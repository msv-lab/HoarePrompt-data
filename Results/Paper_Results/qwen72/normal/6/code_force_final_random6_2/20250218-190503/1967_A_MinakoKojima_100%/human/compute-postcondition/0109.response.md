Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `0 - dif * (1 + 1)`, `ans` is updated to the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` plus `dif`, and `res` is `n - 2` if `dif` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 4`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` remains 0, `ans` remains the first element of the list `a`, and `res` is `n - 1` if `dif` is not 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
