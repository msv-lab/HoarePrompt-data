Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, and the loop will execute one more time if the input value is greater than the number of iterations completed so far.**
