Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the third and the second element of the list `a`, `ans` and `res` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
