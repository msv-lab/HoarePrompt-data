Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`, `k` is 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, which is the same as the first element of the list `a` because `k // (i + 1)` is 0. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3` and `ans` remains the first element of the list `a`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1`. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
