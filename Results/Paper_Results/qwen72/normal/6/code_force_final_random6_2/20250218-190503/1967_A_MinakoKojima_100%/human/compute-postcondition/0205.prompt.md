Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus the sum of all differences `dif` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, and if `k` is not 0, `ans` is further increased by the integer division of `k` by `n` plus `res`, and `res` is the initial value of `n - 1` minus the number of times `res` was decremented during the loop execution plus the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. If `k` is 0, `ans` is increased by `res` and `res` retains its value from the loop execution. `ans_list` is a list that now contains the value of `ans` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the final value after the loop has completed and is now equal to `ans + res`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` as its last element, and the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations or has broken out of the loop due to `k` becoming 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
