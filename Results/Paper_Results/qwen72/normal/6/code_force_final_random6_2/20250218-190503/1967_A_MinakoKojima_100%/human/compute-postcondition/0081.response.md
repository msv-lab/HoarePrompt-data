Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a` (`dif`) is not 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` (since `i` is 0, `dif * (i + 1)` simplifies to `dif`). `res` remains `n - 1`.**
