Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, which is split and converted to integers. The precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still valid, and `t` remains unchanged.
