Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the fourth and the third element of the list `a`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - dif * 3`, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`, and `res` is decreased by 1. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3`, and `res` is updated to `res + k % 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
