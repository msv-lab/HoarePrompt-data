You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins (`k`), and a list of the number of cards of each type (`a`). For each test case, it calculates a final value (`ans`) based on the inputs and prints this value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of all test cases. After the function concludes, the state includes the number of test cases (`t`), the inputs for the last test case (`n`, `k`, and `a`), and the results of all test cases having been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, each type `i` having `a_i` cards.
   - We can buy up to `k` additional cards of any type.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, each number from 1 to `n` must appear exactly once in the subarray.
   - The score is the number of such subarrays we can form.
   - The minimum number of cards of any type `i` is the limiting factor for forming permutations.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of card counts.
   - It sorts the list `a` to handle the smallest counts first.
   - It initializes `ans` to the smallest count in `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), which is the initial limiting factor.
   - It iterates through the sorted list to try to equalize the counts of the cards by using the available coins `k`.
   - If the difference `dif` between the current count and the next count can be covered by the remaining coins, it updates `ans` and reduces `k` accordingly.
   - If the difference cannot be fully covered, it updates `ans` by the maximum possible amount and breaks the loop.
   - After the loop, if there are still coins left, it uses them to further increase the count of cards.
   - Finally, it calculates the score by adding the number of permutations that can be formed and appends the result to `ans_list`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `ans` is set to the smallest count in `a` because this is the initial limiting factor.
     - `res` is set to `n - 1` to keep track of the number of cards that need to be equalized.
   - **Equalizing Counts:**
     - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` and tries to equalize the counts.
     - For each pair of consecutive counts, it calculates the difference `dif`.
     - If `dif` can be covered by the remaining coins, it updates `ans` and reduces `k`.
     - If `dif` cannot be covered, it updates `ans` by the maximum possible amount and breaks the loop.
   - **Using Remaining Coins:**
     - If there are still coins left after the loop, it uses them to further increase the count of cards.
   - **Calculating the Score:**
     - The score is calculated by adding the number of permutations that can be formed and any remaining cards that can be used to form additional permutations.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero or less than the difference between the smallest and next smallest counts.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is large enough to equalize all counts and still have some coins left.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the limiting factor and tries to equalize the counts using the available coins.
   - It correctly calculates the score by considering the number of permutations that can be formed and any remaining cards.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program follows the correct logic to maximize the score by equalizing the counts of cards and using the remaining coins effectively. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given problem description.
