Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and adjusts the indices of the permutation and the array by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing while the problem statement uses 1-based indexing.
   - This adjustment is done using the lines:
     ```python
     for i in range(n):
         p[i] -= 1
         a[i] -= 1
     ```
   - However, the adjustment for `a` is incorrect. The values in `a` should not be adjusted by subtracting 1, as they represent the scores at each position. Only the permutation `p` should be adjusted.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It correctly initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions and a variable `cur` to accumulate the score.
   - The loop continues until either a position is revisited or the number of turns `k` is exhausted.
   - The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is intended to find the maximum possible score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal strategy for the player to maximize their score. The player should always choose the move that maximizes their score, not just the current position.

3. **Output**:
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem's requirements.

Given the issues with the input adjustment for `a` and the flawed logic in `func_1`, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
