Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `1 <= s[0], s[1] <= n`. `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^9`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the new starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `s[0] = p[s[0]]` and `s[1] = p[s[1]]`. `k` is a positive integer such that `0 <= k <= 10^9 - 1`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` value (which was 0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]` or `cur + k * a[s[1]]` (whichever is larger). `cur` is now `a[s[0]] + a[s[1]]`. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, except `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` which are 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` value (which was 0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]` or `cur + k * a[s[1]]` (whichever is larger). `cur` is now `a[s[0]] + a[s[1]] + a[s]`. `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 1. `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is now a list of two integers representing the new starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `s[0] = p[s[0]]` and `s[1] = p[s[1]]`. `k` is a positive integer such that `0 <= k <= 10^9 - 2`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, except `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` which are 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` value (which was 0) and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is `a[s[0]] + a[s[1]] + a[s] + a[s]`, `s` is a list of two integers where `s[0] = p[p[s[0]]]` and `s[1] = p[p[s[1]]]`. `vis[s[0]]`, `vis[s[1]]`, and `vis[s]` are 1. `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `k` is a positive integer such that `0 <= k <= 10^9 - 3`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, except `vis[s[0]]`, `vis[s[1]]`, and `vis[s]` which are 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
