### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.
   - However, the program also adjusts the elements of `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, which is incorrect. The elements of `a` should remain as they are because they represent the scores at each position, and these scores are given in the range [1, 10^9].

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a given starting position `s` and the number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions.
   - The while loop runs until the current position `s` is visited or `k` turns are exhausted.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum score possible by staying at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha, the program compares their final scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
  - `s` is an integer representing the starting position of the player, where `1 <= s <= n`.
  - `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^9`.

- **Function `func_1` behavior:**
  - The function correctly simulates the game for the given starting position `s` and the number of turns `k`.
  - It uses a loop to simulate the game, keeping track of the current score `cur`, the maximum score `mx`, and the visited positions `vis`.
  - The loop terminates when either a position in `s` is revisited (i.e., `vis[s]` is 1) or `k` turns are exhausted.
  - The function returns the maximum score `mx` that the player can achieve.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `a`:** The elements of `a` should not be adjusted by subtracting 1. This is a critical error because it changes the values of the scores, which are supposed to be in the range [1, 10^9].

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation indices to 0-based
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program remains as provided, due to the incorrect adjustment of `a`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False** (due to the incorrect adjustment of `a` in the original program).
