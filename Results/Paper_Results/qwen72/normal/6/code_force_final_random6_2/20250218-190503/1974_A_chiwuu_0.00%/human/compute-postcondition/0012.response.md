Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**
