### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `n` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` to determine the total number of cells required for the 2x2 icons.
   - The number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is calculated using:
     ```python
     if t % 5 == 0:
         t = t // 5
     else:
         t = t // 5 + 1
     ```
     This ensures that `t` is the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the 2x2 icons, considering each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` to determine the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), then the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, additional screens are needed:
     ```python
     t2 = a - t1
     if t2 % 15 == 0:
         t = t + t2 // 15
     else:
         t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
     This ensures that the additional screens are calculated correctly to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Handling 2x2 Icons**:
  - The calculation `t = b * 2` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and `b * 2` gives the total number of cells required.
  - The division and ceiling operation `t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0` ensures that the number of screens is correctly calculated.

- **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
  - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` correctly determines the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - The additional screens are calculated correctly using `t2 = a - t1` and the division and ceiling operation.

### Edge Cases:

- **Zero Icons**:
  - If `a = 0` and `b = 0`, the function correctly outputs `0` screens.
- **Only 1x1 Icons**:
  - If `b = 0`, the function correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `a` 1x1 icons.
- **Only 2x2 Icons**:
  - If `a = 0`, the function correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly handles the given problem and all edge cases. The logic and calculations are sound and produce the correct output for the given inputs.
