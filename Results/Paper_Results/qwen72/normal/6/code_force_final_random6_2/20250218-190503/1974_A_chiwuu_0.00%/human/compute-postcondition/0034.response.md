Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- Therefore, `t2 // 15` is `(a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- The new value of `t` is `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- If `t` was originally divisible by 5, it was `b * 2 // 5`, so the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- If `t` was originally not divisible by 5, it was `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, so the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
