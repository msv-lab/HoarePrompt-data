Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; `t` is `b * 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t = b * 2` updates the value of `t` to be twice the value of `b`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `t` and all the initial conditions that are still valid.
