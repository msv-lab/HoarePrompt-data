Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string; `b` is the integer value of the second part of the input string; `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 < a`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1.** 

The code `a = int(a)` converts `a` to an integer, but since `a` is already described as an integer value of the first part of the input string, the value of `a` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
