To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `t` is either \( \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 2}{5} \right\rfloor \) or \( \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 \) depending on whether \( b \times 2 \) is divisible by 5.

2. **Logic:**
   - Calculate \( t1 \) as \( t \times 15 - b \times 4 \).
   - If \( t1 \geq a \), then `t1` remains \( t \times 15 - b \times 4 \) and is greater than or equal to `a`.
   - Otherwise, update `t` to \( t + \left\lfloor \frac{t2}{15} \right\rfloor \) or \( t + \left\lfloor \frac{t2}{15} \right\rfloor + 1 \) if \( t2 \% 15 \neq 0 \), where \( t2 = a - t1 \).
   - Recalculate \( t1 \) as \( t \times 15 - b \times 4 \) and ensure it is less than `a`.
   - `t2` is \( a - t1 \) and is divisible by 15 if \( t2 \% 15 == 0 \).

3. **Determine the Value of `t`:**
   - First, `t` is calculated as \( \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 2}{5} \right\rfloor \) or \( \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
   - \( t1 \) is then calculated as \( t \times 15 - b \times 4 \).
   - If \( t1 \geq a \), `t` remains the same.
   - If \( t1 < a \), `t` is updated to \( t + \left\lfloor \frac{t2}{15} \right\rfloor \) or \( t + \left\lfloor \frac{t2}{15} \right\rfloor + 1 \), where \( t2 = a - t1 \).

4. **Final Value of `t`:**
   - The final value of `t` is the value that ensures \( t1 \geq a \) or is updated to ensure \( t1 < a \) and \( t2 \) is divisible by 15.

Given the complexity and the conditions, the value of `t` can be described as follows:
- Initially, \( t \) is either \( \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 2}{5} \right\rfloor \) or \( \left\lfloor \frac{b \times 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
- If \( t1 \geq a \), `t` remains the same.
- If \( t1 < a \), `t` is updated to ensure \( t1 < a \) and \( t2 \) is divisible by 15.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the logic, the value of `t` will be the smallest integer that satisfies the conditions described.

Output: **t (where t is the smallest integer such that t1 is either greater than or equal to a or t1 is less than a and t2 is divisible by 15, and t1 is calculated as t * 15 - b * 4)**
