Output State: **The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2t + 1 lines, `line` is the (2t + 1)-th line of the file.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over every other line starting from the third line in the file opened by `open(0)`.
- For the loop to execute `t` times, the file must have at least `2t + 1` lines. This is because the loop skips the first and second lines and then processes every second line after that.
- After all iterations, `line` will be the last line processed by the loop, which is the (2t + 1)-th line of the file.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the loop.
