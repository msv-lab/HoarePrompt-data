### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each card has an integer from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize your score, you should play a card that has already been played by Nene, if possible.
   - Nene will always play a card that has already been played by you, if possible, to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It processes every second line starting from the third line, which corresponds to the lines containing the card values in your hand.
   - The program splits the line into tokens (card values) and calculates the number of duplicates in your hand.
   - The number of duplicates is determined by the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of duplicates in your hand, which is the number of cards that appear more than once.
   - However, the program does not account for the fact that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score. Specifically, if you have a duplicate card, Nene will play the matching card as soon as possible to prevent you from scoring.
   - The program assumes that the number of duplicates directly translates to the number of points you can score, which is not always true due to Nene's optimal play.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 1 2 3`, the program will output `1` because there is one duplicate (1). This is correct because you can score 1 point if Nene plays optimally.
   - For the input `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`, the program will output `2` because there are two duplicates (8 and 5). This is correct because you can score 2 points if Nene plays optimally.
   - For the input `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`, the program will output `1` because there is one duplicate (4). This is correct because you can score 1 point if Nene plays optimally.
   - For the input `1 2 3`, the program will output `0` because there are no duplicates. This is correct because you cannot score any points.
   - For the input `1`, the program will output `0` because there are no duplicates. This is correct because you cannot score any points.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic of counting duplicates is correct for the given problem constraints and examples.
   - Despite the program not explicitly modeling Nene's optimal play, it still produces the correct output for the given examples. This is because the number of duplicates in your hand directly determines the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene will always play optimally to minimize your score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct for the given problem constraints and examples. It correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the duplicates in your hand, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
