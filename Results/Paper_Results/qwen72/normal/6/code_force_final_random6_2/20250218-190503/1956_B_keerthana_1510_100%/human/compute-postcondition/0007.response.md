Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It is designed to process multiple test cases, where each test case involves a sequence of integers representing the cards in a player's hand. For each test case, it returns a result based on the analysis of the card sequence. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. For each test case, the number of cards, `n`, is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5. The integers on the cards, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, are within the range 1 to `n`, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
