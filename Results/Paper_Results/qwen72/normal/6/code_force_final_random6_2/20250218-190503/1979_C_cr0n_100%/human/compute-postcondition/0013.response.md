Let's break down the initial state and the operations described to understand what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.
2. `vals` is a list of `N` integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N.
3. `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially, starting with `vals[0]` as the initial value. The function `func_1` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer that it is some operation that results in an integer value.
4. `vprod` is a list of `N` integers where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division).
5. `den` is now `den` minus the sum of `vprod`.
6. The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`den` Calculation**:
   - `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially. Without the exact definition of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact value of `den`, but we know it is an integer.
   
2. **`vprod` Calculation**:
   - `vprod` is a list of `N` integers where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division. This means each element in `vprod` is `den // vals[i]`.

3. **Update `den`**:
   - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - Since `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is `den // vals[i]`, the sum of `vprod` will be a non-negative integer.
   - The precondition states that the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0 after this update.

### Conclusion:
- Given that the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0, the `print` statement will always print `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
