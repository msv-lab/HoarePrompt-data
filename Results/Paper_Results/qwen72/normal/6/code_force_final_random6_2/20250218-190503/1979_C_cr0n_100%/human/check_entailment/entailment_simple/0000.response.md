### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to find a common denominator `den`.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // k_i`.
   - The total bet is `sum(den // k_i)`.
   - The program checks if `den - sum(den // k_i) > 0` to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It is used to find the LCM of all elements in `vals`.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all elements in `vals` and stores it in `den`.
   - It calculates the bets for each outcome as `den // k_i` and stores them in `vprod`.
   - It checks if the total bet is less than `den`. If not, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - If the total bet is less than `den`, it prints the bets.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are integers and that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - If the condition is not met, the program correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be `k_i`, and the total bet will be `N * (den // k_i)`. For this to be less than `den`, `N` must be less than `k_i`.
   - If `N` is greater than or equal to `k_i`, the program correctly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for the given problem. It handles edge cases and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Correctness:
**True**
