Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. For example, consider the input:

```
2
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

According to the problem description, if all multipliers are the same, there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The program, however, does not correctly identify this and outputs a distribution of coins, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1` in this case.
