Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[1])`, `x` is the second element of `vals`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `N` remains unchanged.
- The list `vals` remains unchanged.
- The value of `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`, where `den` was initially the result of `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])` and `x` is the second element of `vals`.
- The value of `x` remains the second element of `vals`.
