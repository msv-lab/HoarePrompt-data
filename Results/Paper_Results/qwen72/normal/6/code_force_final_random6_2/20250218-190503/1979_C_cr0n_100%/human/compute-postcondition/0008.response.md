Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[2])`, `x` is the third element of `vals`.**

Explanation:
- `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`, where `x` is the third element of `vals` (i.e., `vals[2]`).
- The other variables (`N`, `vals`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `N` is an input integer within the range 1 to 50, and `vals` is a list of integers within the range 2 to 20, is still valid.
- The new value of `den` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the previous value of `den` and the third element of `vals`.
