Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially, starting with `vals[0]` as the initial value, `vprod` is a list of N integers where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division), `den` is now `den` minus the sum of `vprod`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `den` is updated to be the original `den` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
- The other variables (`N`, `vals`, and `vprod`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `den` is calculated based on the sum of `vprod`, which is a list of integers derived from the original `den` and the elements of `vals`.
