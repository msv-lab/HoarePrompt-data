Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should be such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

for all \(i\).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the list of multipliers \(vals\).

2. **Calculating LCM**:
   - It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals`.
   - It then iterates over all elements in `vals` and updates `den` to be the LCM of the current `den` and the current element. This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all elements in `vals`.

3. **Calculating Bets**:
   - It computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. This means \(vprod[i] = \frac{den}{vals[i]}\).

4. **Checking Total Bets**:
   - It calculates the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes by summing up `vprod`.
   - It then subtracts this sum from `den` to get the difference.
   - If the difference is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that it is not possible to distribute the coins as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

### Verification:
- **LCM Calculation**:
  - The LCM of all multipliers ensures that the bets are integers and that the total sum of bets is a multiple of the LCM.
  
- **Bets Calculation**:
  - The bets \(x_i\) are calculated as \( \frac{den}{k_i} \), where `den` is the LCM of all \(k_i\).
  - The total sum of bets is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{den}{k_i} \).

- **Condition Check**:
  - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{den}{k_i} < den \) must hold for the solution to be valid.
  - This is equivalent to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} < 1 \).

### Correctness:
- The function correctly calculates the LCM of all multipliers.
- The bets are calculated such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the LCM of the multipliers.
- The function checks if the total sum of bets is less than the LCM and prints the bets if the condition is met, otherwise it prints `-1`.

Given the problem constraints and the behavior of the functions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
