### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This ensures that the heap is sorted by the ticket prices, allowing us to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which is the cheapest available day to buy tickets.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day, which is `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - It also updates the number of tickets bought and the price increase for subsequent days.

5. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly calculated by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to `price_increase`.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted correctly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to return the total cost of buying `k` tickets.
- It uses a min-heap to always select the cheapest available day to buy tickets.
- The heap is initialized with the original prices and their corresponding days.
- The program correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days by adding the number of tickets bought to `price_increase`.
- The total cost is calculated by summing the cost of tickets bought each day, taking into account the price increase.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \le m \le 10^9\), and \(1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9)\) correctly.
- The program ensures that the heap is always used to find the cheapest available day, and the price increase is applied correctly to subsequent days.

### Example Verification:
- For the first test case:
  - \( n = 4 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 3 \), \( prices = [8, 6, 4, 2] \)
  - The optimal way to buy 3 tickets is:
    - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at \(2\) each, total cost \(4\), price increase \(2\).
    - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at \(4 + 2 = 6\) each, total cost \(6\).
  - Total cost: \(4 + 6 = 10\).

- For the second test case:
  - \( n = 4 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 8 \), \( prices = [8, 6, 4, 2] \)
  - The only way to buy 8 tickets is:
    - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at \(8\) each, total cost \(16\), price increase \(2\).
    - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at \(6 + 2 = 8\) each, total cost \(16\), price increase \(4\).
    - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets at \(4 + 4 = 8\) each, total cost \(16\), price increase \(6\).
    - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at \(2 + 6 = 8\) each, total cost \(16\).
  - Total cost: \(16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64\).

- For the third test case:
  - \( n = 5 \), \( m = 100 \), \( k = 1 \), \( prices = [10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000] \)
  - The optimal way to buy 1 ticket is:
    - Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at \(1\) each.
  - Total cost: \(1\).

- For the fourth test case:
  - \( n = 6 \), \( m = 3 \), \( k = 9 \), \( prices = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - The optimal way to buy 9 tickets is:
    - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets at \(5\) each, total cost \(15\), price increase \(3\).
    - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets at \(5 + 3 = 8\) each, total cost \(24\), price increase \(6\).
    - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets at \(5 + 6 = 11\) each, total cost \(33\).
  - Total cost: \(15 + 24 + 33 = 72\).

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. It uses a priority queue to always buy the cheapest available tickets and adjusts the prices for subsequent days accordingly. The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly.

Final: **True**
