### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This ensures that the heap is sorted by the ticket prices, allowing us to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which is the cheapest available day to buy tickets.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day, which is `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - It also updates the number of tickets bought and the price increase for subsequent days.

5. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly calculated by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to `price_increase`.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted correctly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Heap Initialization and Operations:**
  - The heap is initialized correctly with the initial prices and their respective days.
  - The heap operations (`heapq.heappop`) ensure that the program always buys tickets from the cheapest available day.

- **Price Adjustment:**
  - The price adjustment is done by adding `price_increase` to the price of the tickets bought on the current day.
  - This adjustment is cumulative, meaning that the price increase is applied to all subsequent days, which is consistent with the problem statement.

- **Ticket Purchase Logic:**
  - The program buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
  - This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily purchase limit and buys exactly `k` tickets in total.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` (i.e., all tickets can be bought in a single day).
  - It also handles cases where `k` is much larger than `m`, requiring multiple days of purchases.

### Validation of Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - The initial state of the program before the function call is correctly described: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `prices` is a list of `n` integers within the specified range.

- **State After Each Iteration:**
  - The state after each iteration of the while loop is correctly described: `total_cost` is updated with the cost of the tickets bought, `tickets_bought` is incremented by the number of tickets bought, and `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought.

- **Final State:**
  - The final state of the program after the while loop is correctly described: `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, and `price_increase` will be equal to `k`.
  - The heap `pq` will be empty or contain only items with prices higher than those of the tickets already bought.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. It uses a priority queue to always buy the cheapest available tickets and adjusts the prices for subsequent days accordingly. The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly.

Final: **True**
