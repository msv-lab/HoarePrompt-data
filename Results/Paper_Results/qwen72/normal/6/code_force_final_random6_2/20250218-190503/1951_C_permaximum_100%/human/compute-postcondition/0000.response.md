Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `pq` using a list comprehension.
- Each element in `pq` is a tuple `(price, i)`, where `price` is an element from the `prices` list, and `i` is the index of that element in `prices`.
- The length of `pq` is the same as the length of `prices`, which is `n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The values of `prices` remain unchanged.
- The new list `pq` contains tuples where the first element is the price and the second element is the index of that price in the `prices` list.
