Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables will have the following states: `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, and `price_increase` will be equal to `k`. The heap `pq` will be empty or the remaining elements in `pq` will have prices that are higher than the prices of the tickets already bought.**

In natural language, this means:
- `total_cost` will contain the total cost of buying `k` tickets, taking into account the increasing price of tickets as more are bought.
- `tickets_bought` will be exactly `k`, indicating that the desired number of tickets has been purchased.
- `price_increase` will be `k`, reflecting the total number of tickets bought and the cumulative increase in price.
- The heap `pq` will either be empty or will contain only tuples with prices that are higher than the prices of the tickets already bought, as all the cheaper tickets have been processed and removed from the heap.
