The value of `tickets_bought` is incremented by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. The value of `tickets_to_buy` is calculated as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. Since `tickets_bought` was initially 0, the value of `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`. Therefore, `tickets_bought` is now `min(m, k)`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `total_cost`, `price_increase`, `price`, and `day`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, arranged such that the smallest price is at the root, but the smallest tuple has been removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`. `price_increase` is 0. `price` is the smallest price in the initial `pq` heap plus `price_increase`, and `day` is the corresponding index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.**
