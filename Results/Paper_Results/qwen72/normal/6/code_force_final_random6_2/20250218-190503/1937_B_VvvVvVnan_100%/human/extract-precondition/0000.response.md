Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the width of the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings of length n, representing the rows of the 2 × n grid for each test case. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, grid_list):
```

Where:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n_list` is a list of integers, each representing the width of the grid for each test case.
- `grid_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n grid for each test case.
