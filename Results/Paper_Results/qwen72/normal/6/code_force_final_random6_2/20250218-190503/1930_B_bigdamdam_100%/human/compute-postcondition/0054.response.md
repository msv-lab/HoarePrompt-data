Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `p[1]` is set to `1 + n % 2`, `p[3]` is set to `3 + n % 2`, `p[5]` is set to `5 + n % 2`, and so on for all odd indices up to `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n-2` if `n` is even, `ind` is increased by `2 * (n // 2)` if `n` is even, or `2 * ((n - 1) // 2)` if `n` is odd, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.**

Explanation:
- The list `p` is now initialized to a list of `n` zeros.
- The values of `p[1]`, `p[3]`, `p[5]`, etc., remain as they were set in the initial state.
- The value of `ind` and `i` remain as they were set in the initial state.
- The condition that the input value must be greater than the new value of `i` remains valid.
