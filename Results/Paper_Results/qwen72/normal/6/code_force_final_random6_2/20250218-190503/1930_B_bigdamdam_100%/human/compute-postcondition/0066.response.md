Output State: **`i` is `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is odd), `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, and so on, with all even indices filled with decreasing values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and all odd indices remain as they were in the initial state. `ind` is 1 if `n` is odd, and 2 if `n` is even.**
