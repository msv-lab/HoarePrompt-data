Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `p[3]` is `ind`, `ind` is increased by 2, `i` is 3**

The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Since `i` is 3, `p[3]` is now equal to `ind`. The other variables `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged, except that the value of `ind` is already known to be increased by 2 from the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects these conditions.
