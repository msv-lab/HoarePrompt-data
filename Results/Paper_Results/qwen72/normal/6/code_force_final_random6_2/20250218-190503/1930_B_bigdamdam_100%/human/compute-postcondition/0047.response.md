The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from 1, and the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `i` is 3

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will be 5
- `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to continue executing

State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is set to `ind`, `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 2**
