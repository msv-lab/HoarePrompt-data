Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
   - After that, it fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.

3. **Avoiding Divisibility Conditions**:
   - By placing the largest odd numbers in the even indices and the smallest odd numbers in the odd indices, the program ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation can both be even or both be odd.
   - This construction helps avoid the situation where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any valid `i` and `j`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program's approach is valid and should produce a correct permutation for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
