You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `p` is a list of length `n` where every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, and every odd-indexed element (starting from 1) is filled with values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2. `ind` is the next even number after the last filled odd index.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns a value based on a predefined integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The specific return value is not provided in the problem statement, so the exact functionality cannot be fully described.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
