Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with `p[1]` set to `1 + n % 2`, `p[3]` set to `3 + n % 2`, `p[5]` set to `5 + n % 2`, and so on for all odd indices up to `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n-2` if `n` is even, `ind` is now equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
