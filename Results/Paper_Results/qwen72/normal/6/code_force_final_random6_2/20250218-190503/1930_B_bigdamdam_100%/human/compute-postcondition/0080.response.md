Functionality: ** The function reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and constructs a list `p` of length `n`. The list `p` is filled such that every even-indexed element (starting from 0) contains values decreasing by 2 starting from `n`, and every odd-indexed element (starting from 1) contains values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2. The function then prints the contents of the list `p` for each iteration. After the function concludes, the list `p` is no longer in scope, and the program state is reset for the next iteration, if any. **
