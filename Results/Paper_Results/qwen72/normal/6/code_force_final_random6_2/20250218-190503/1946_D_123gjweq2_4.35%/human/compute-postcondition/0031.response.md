Output State: **The program returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 or 0.** 

- If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, the program returns -1.
- If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, the program returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position, and `bit - 1` is an integer such that 0 <= bit - 1 < 30.
