Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is correctly handled by reading the number of test cases and then iterating through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to solve the problem, but it does not use the parameter `x` at all. Instead, it calls `find_max` with a fixed bit value of 31, which is outside the valid range for the problem (0 <= bit < 30). This suggests that `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic for the problem.

3. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments that meet the criteria. It processes the array to create a new array `new_arr` containing the XOR of elements that have a 0 at the current bit position.
   - If the bit at the current position in the final `xor` value is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
   - If the bit at the current position in the final `xor` value is 0, it returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on the bit at the current position in `x`.

4. **Logic Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` should be using the parameter `x` to determine the maximum number of segments. Instead, it is passing a fixed value of 31 to `find_max`, which is incorrect.
   - The function `find_max` is designed to handle the bitwise operations correctly, but it is not being called with the correct parameters from `func_1`.

5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` should call `find_max` with the correct parameters, specifically `arr` and `x`, to ensure that the bitwise operations are performed correctly according to the problem description.

Given these issues, the program is not correct because `func_1` does not use the parameter `x` and calls `find_max` with an incorrect bit value.

Correctness: **False**
