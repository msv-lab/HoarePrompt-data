It returns the number of elements in `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to create a new list `new_arr` containing the XOR of elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position.

If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is 0, it returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on the bit at position `bit` in `xor`.
