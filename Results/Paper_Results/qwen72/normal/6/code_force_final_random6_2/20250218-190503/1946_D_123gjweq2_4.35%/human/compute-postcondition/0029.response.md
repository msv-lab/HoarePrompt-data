Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**

- `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is a function call that returns the maximum value from the list `cur_arr` after considering the bit at position `bit - 1`.
- `new_arr` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position.
- The length of `new_arr` is the number of elements in `new_arr`.
- The program returns the larger of these two values: the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
