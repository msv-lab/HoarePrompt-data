### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments \( k \) such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).
   - The segments must be contiguous and cover the entire array from index 1 to \( n \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of 31 is likely because \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \), so the highest bit position to consider is 31 (0-indexed).

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - This function is a recursive function that processes the array `cur_arr` bit by bit, starting from the highest bit (31).
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`, which means all bits have been processed.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - It initializes `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
     - It initializes `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR result.
     - It iterates through `cur_arr` and updates `xor` with the current element.
     - If `xor` does not set the current bit (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), it appends `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
     - After the loop, if `xor` still sets the current bit, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that no valid segment can be formed.
     - If `xor` does not set the current bit, it recursively calls `find_max` on `new_arr` with the next lower bit.
     - If the current bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), it returns the maximum of two values:
       - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which processes the array without considering the current bit.
       - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed by ignoring the current bit.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set, it returns `thing1`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` processes the array from the highest bit to the lowest bit, ensuring that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is checked against `x`.
   - The base case correctly returns the length of the array when all bits have been processed.
   - The recursive case correctly handles the splitting of the array into segments based on the current bit and ensures that the segments are valid.
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be formed by setting `thing1` to -1.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the current bit of `x` is set by returning the maximum of two possible values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is 0, and the array contains elements that are not 0.
   - The function should handle cases where the array contains only 0s.
   - The function should handle cases where the array is of length 1.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the given examples, the function should produce the correct outputs:
     - For `3 1` and `1 2 3`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
     - For `2 2` and `1 1`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
     - For `2 2` and `1 3`, the maximum \( k \) is 1.
     - For `2 3` and `0 0`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
     - For `3 2` and `0 0 1`, the maximum \( k \) is 3.
     - For `4 2` and `1 3 3 7`, the maximum \( k \) is -1.
     - For `2 2` and `2 3`, the maximum \( k \) is -1.
     - For `5 0` and `0 1 2 2 1`, the maximum \( k \) is 2.
