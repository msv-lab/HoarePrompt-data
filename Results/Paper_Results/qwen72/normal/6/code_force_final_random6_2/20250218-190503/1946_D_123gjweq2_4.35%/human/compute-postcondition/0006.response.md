The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `cur_arr`. The loop will execute if `cur_arr` is not empty, as `i` will take on the values of the elements in `cur_arr`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not equal to -1.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, `cur_arr` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be the first element of `cur_arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
