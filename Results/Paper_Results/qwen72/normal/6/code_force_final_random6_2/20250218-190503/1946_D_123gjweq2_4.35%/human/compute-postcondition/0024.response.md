Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is -1. The current value of `xor` has a 1 at the `bit` position.**

Explanation:
- The value of `thing1` is updated to -1.
- The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `xor` has a 1 at the `bit` position is still valid.
