The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `cur_arr` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0.**
