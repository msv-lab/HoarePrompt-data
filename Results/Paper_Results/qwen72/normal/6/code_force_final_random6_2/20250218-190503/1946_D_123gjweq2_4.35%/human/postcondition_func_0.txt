The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, but it does not use `x` in its execution. It returns the maximum integer value from the list `arr`, where all integers in `arr` are between 0 and 2^30 - 1. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the maximum value from `arr` is returned, and `x` remains unchanged.
