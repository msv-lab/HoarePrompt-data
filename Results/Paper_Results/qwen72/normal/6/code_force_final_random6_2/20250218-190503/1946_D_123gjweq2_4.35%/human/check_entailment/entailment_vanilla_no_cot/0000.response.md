Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with a fixed bit value of 31, which is incorrect because the problem specifies that the maximum value for `x` is less than \(2^{30}\), and the bitwise operations should be performed within the range of 0 to 29 bits (since \(2^{30}\) is the maximum value for `x` and it has 30 bits).

Additionally, the logic in `find_max` is flawed. The function attempts to recursively find the maximum number of segments by checking the highest bit first, but it does not correctly handle the conditions for the bitwise OR and XOR operations as required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the cumulative bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should solve the problem correctly:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    n = len(arr)
    max_segments = -1
    current_xor = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_xor ^= arr[i]
        if current_xor | x == x:
            max_segments = i + 1
    return max_segments

# Reading input and processing multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr, x))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and maintains a running XOR value `current_xor`.
   - For each element in the array, it checks if the bitwise OR of `current_xor` and `x` is equal to `x`. If this condition is true, it means that the current segment can be included in the solution.
   - It updates `max_segments` to the current index + 1 (since indices are 0-based) if the condition is met.
   - Finally, it returns `max_segments`, which will be the maximum number of segments that satisfy the condition, or -1 if no such segments exist.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the array `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

This approach ensures that the program correctly finds the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.
