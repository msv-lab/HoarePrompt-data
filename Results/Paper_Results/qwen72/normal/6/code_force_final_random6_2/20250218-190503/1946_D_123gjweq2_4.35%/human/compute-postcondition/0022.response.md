Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`cur_arr`**: The original list of non-negative integers remains unchanged.
- **`bit`**: The bit position (an integer between 0 and 29) remains unchanged.
- **`new_arr`**: This list contains the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position. If no such elements exist, `new_arr` will be an empty list.
- **`xor`**: After the loop finishes, `xor` is reset to 0.
- **`thing1`**: This variable remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
