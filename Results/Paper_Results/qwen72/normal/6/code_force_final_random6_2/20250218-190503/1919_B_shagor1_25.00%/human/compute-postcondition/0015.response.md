The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.
