Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `i` is the first character of `s` and is currently equal to '-', `neg` is 1, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.**

The value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
