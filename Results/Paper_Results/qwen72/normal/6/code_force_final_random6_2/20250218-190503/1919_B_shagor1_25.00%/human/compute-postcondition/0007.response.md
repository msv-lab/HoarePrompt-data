The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with at least one character, and `i` is the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least two characters, and `i` will be the second character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string with at least two characters, `i` is the second character of `s`, `neg` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.**
