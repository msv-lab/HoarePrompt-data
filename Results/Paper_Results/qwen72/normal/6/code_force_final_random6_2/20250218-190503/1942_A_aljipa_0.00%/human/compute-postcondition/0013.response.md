Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop has run `t` times). The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last input integers provided during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `res` will be a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, and a list containing `-1` otherwise. The state of any other variables not mentioned in the loop head or body remains unchanged.
