Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. This is done using `t = int(input())` and a loop `for _ in range(t)`.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements, all set to `1` using `res = [1] * n`.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `1`, it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. One way to achieve this is to have an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, and the first element is the smallest. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements using `res = range(n)`, which generates a sequence from `0` to `n-1`.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**:
     - The original assessment states that if `k` is neither `1` nor `n`, the program outputs `-1` using `res = [-1]`. However, this is incorrect. There are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for values of `k` other than `1` and `n`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of each test case using `print(*res)`. This correctly unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces, which is the required format for the output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is `1` or `n` correctly.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where `k` is between `1` and `n` (exclusive), which can still have valid solutions.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints. Specifically, it incorrectly outputs `-1` for valid cases where `k` is between `1` and `n` (exclusive).

Final: **False**
