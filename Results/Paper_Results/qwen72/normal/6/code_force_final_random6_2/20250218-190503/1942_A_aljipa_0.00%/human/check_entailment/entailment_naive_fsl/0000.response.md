Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \(1 < k < n\). According to the problem description, the program should output an array that has exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts. However, the current implementation only handles the cases where \(k = n\) (all cyclic shifts are sorted) or \(k = 1\) (only one cyclic shift is sorted). For any other value of \(k\), the program incorrectly outputs \(-1\), which is not always the correct answer.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
```
The expected output should be an array of length 4 with exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts. However, the program outputs \(-1\), which is incorrect. A correct output for this case could be:
```
1 2 3 1
```
This array has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 3, 1]\) and \([1, 1, 2, 3]\).
