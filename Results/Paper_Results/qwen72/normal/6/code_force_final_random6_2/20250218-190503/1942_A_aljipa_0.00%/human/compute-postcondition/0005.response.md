The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`** 

After adjustment:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`**
