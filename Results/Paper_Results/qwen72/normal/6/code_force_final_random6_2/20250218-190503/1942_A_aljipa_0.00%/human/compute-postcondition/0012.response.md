Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 2` (This is a bit confusing and not directly relevant to the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for now).
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - `res` is a list defined based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
     - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(*res)`, which will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - We need to consider the three possible cases for the value of `k`:
     - **Case 1: `k == n`**
       - `res` will be a list of `n` ones.
       - Example: If `n = 5`, then `res = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
       - Output: **1 1 1 1 1**
     - **Case 2: `k == 1`**
       - `res` will be a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
       - Example: If `n = 5`, then `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
       - Output: **0 1 2 3 4**
     - **Case 3: `k` is neither `n` nor 1**
       - `res` will be a list containing `-1`.
       - Example: If `n = 5` and `k = 3`, then `res = [-1]`.
       - Output: **-1**

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can describe the output based on the conditions given:

Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k == n, where the list contains n ones)**
Output: **[0 1 2 ... (n-1)] (if k == 1, where the list contains numbers from 0 to n-1)**
Output: **-1 (if k is neither n nor 1)**

To provide a single, precise output based on the given conditions:

Output: **[1 1 1 ... 1] (if k == n, where the list contains n ones) [0 1 2 ... (n-1)] (if k == 1, where the list contains numbers from 0 to n-1) -1 (if k is neither n nor 1)**
