The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 2`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used and is incremented internally by the `range` function, we don't need to explicitly state its value. However, the key state to adjust is `t`.

State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`**
