Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, and `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.***
