Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the length of `lst` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the element at index 2 of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and `lst` has its first and third elements removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (after converting them to integers), the first element of `lst` is removed, and the third element of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
