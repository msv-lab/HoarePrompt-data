Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `l` is the new input string, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the two integers obtained from converting the first and second elements of `lst` to integers.
- The initial value of `ans` was 0, so the new value of `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `lst`, `ans_f`, `l`) remain unchanged.
