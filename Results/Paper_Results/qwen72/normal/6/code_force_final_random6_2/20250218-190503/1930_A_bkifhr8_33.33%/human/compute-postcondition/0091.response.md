Output State: **`i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans` and the previous values of `ans` that were appended to `ans_f`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) for each iteration, and elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., `n * 2 - 2` have been removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.**
