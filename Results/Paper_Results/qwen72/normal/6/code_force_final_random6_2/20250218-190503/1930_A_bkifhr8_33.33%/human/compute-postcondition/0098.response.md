Let's break down the precondition and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Precondition Analysis:
1. **`i` is `ans_f[t + 1]`**:
   - This means that the variable `i` is assigned the value of the element at index `t + 1` in the list `ans_f`.

2. **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50**:
   - `n` is an integer within the range from 1 to 50, inclusive.

3. **`ans_f` is a list of `t + 2` integers where `t` must be greater than 0**:
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `t + 2` integers.
   - Since `t` must be greater than 0, the minimum length of `ans_f` is 3 (when `t = 1`).

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(i)
```
- This statement prints the value of the variable `i`.

### Determining the Output:
- From the precondition, we know that `i` is assigned the value of `ans_f[t + 1]`.
- Since `ans_f` is a list of `t + 2` integers, the index `t + 1` is within the valid range of indices for the list `ans_f` (which ranges from 0 to `t + 1`).

### Conclusion:
- The value of `i` is the element at index `t + 1` in the list `ans_f`.
- The exact value of `i` depends on the specific values in the list `ans_f` and the value of `t`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans_f[t + 1] (where ans_f is a list of t + 2 integers and t is greater than 0)**
