Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the length of `lst` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the element at index 2 of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
