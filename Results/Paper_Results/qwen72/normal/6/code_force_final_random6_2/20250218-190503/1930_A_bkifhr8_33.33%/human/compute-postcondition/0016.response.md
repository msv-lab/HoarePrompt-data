The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n * 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and `n` must still be an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50**
