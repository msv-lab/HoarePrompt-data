Output State: **`i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two integers in `lst` for each iteration until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, with elements removed in pairs until 2 or fewer elements remain, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.**

The value of `ans` is appended to the list `ans_f`. The other variables remain unchanged.
