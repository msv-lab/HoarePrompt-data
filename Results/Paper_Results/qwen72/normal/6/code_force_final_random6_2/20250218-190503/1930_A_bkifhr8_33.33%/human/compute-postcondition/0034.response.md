Output State: **`i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is 0, `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining, `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.
