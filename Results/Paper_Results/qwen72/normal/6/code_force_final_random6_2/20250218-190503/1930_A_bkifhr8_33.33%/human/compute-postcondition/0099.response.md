Output State: **`i` is the last element of `ans_f`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers where `t` must be greater than 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `i` will be the last element of the list `ans_f`. This is because the loop iterates over each element of `ans_f`, and the loop variable `i` will take on the value of the last element in the list once the loop finishes.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans_f`**: The list `ans_f` remains a list of `t` integers, where `t` must be greater than 0. The loop does not modify the length of `ans_f` or its contents; it only iterates over the elements of `ans_f`.

Thus, the final output state is that `i` is the last element of `ans_f`, `n` is still an input integer within the specified range, and `ans_f` is still a list of `t` integers.
