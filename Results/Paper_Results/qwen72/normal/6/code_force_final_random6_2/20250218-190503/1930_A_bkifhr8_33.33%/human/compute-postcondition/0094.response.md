Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers where `t` must be greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(i)` will print the value of `i`.

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is calculated as `t - 1`.
   - Since `t` is the length of the list `ans_f` and `t` must be greater than 0, `i` will be the index of the last element in the list `ans_f`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `i` will be `t - 1`, where `t` is the length of the list `ans_f`.

Output: **t - 1 (where t is the length of the list `ans_f`)**
