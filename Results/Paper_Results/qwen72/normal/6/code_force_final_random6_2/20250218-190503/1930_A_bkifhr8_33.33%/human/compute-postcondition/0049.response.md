Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two integers in `lst` and the previous `ans`, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, with the first element (index 0) removed and the third element (index 2) removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` and the previous `ans`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` simplifies to `lst.remove(lst[2])`, which removes the third element (index 2) from the list `lst`.
- The initial state specifies that if the length of `lst` is not 2, the third element (index 2) of `lst` is removed. The code snippet directly implements this condition.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, `ans_f`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The input string `l` and the list `lst` are still valid, but `lst` now has the third element removed if it was present.
- If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `lst` remains unchanged.
- The output state reflects these changes and retains all other initial conditions.
