Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and `lst` has its first and third elements removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
