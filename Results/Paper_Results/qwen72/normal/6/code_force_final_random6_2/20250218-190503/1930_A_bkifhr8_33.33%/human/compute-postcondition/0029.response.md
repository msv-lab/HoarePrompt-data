Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (after converting them to integers), the first element of `lst` is removed, and the third element of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
