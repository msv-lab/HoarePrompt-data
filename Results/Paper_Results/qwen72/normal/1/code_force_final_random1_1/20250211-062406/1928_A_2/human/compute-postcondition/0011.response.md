Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integer values from the input.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- Neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true.
- The difference `(a - b)` is even.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string and does not depend on any variables or calculations.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **no**
