Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` and `b` are input integers. If at least one of `a` or `b` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2` if `a` is even, and `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2` if `b` is even. If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `b` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if both `a` and `b` are odd, the current iteration is skipped. If `b` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, the program does not skip the current iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
