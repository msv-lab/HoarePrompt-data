Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
