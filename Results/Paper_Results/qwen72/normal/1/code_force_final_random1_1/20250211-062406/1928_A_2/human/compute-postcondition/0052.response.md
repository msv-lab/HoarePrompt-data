Output State: **`t` is decremented to 0, `_` has been incremented from 0 to `t-1`, `a` and `b` have been updated with new input integers for each iteration. For each iteration, if `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. The loop prints 'Yes' if either `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the loop prints 'No'. After all iterations, the loop completes and `t` is 0.**
