### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

#### Problem Requirements:
- Bob can cut the rectangle \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles.
- He can then try to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
- If the new rectangle is different from the original \(a \times b\) (ignoring rotations), the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, it is "No".

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions:**
   - **First Condition:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:`
     - This condition checks if both dimensions are even. If true, it prints "yes".
     - This is correct because if both dimensions are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - **Second Condition:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
     - This condition is incorrect and does not make logical sense. It checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), which is not relevant to the problem.
   - **Third Condition:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
     - This condition checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd. If true, it prints "yes".
     - This is partially correct but incomplete. It should check if either dimension is greater than 1, as this would allow for a cut that results in a different rectangle configuration.
   - **Else Condition:** `else:`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no".

#### Counterexample:
- For the input `2 3`, the correct output should be "Yes" because the 2x3 rectangle can be cut into two 2x1 and 1x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as 2x3.
- However, the program outputs "No" for this input due to the incorrect conditions.

#### Correct Approach:
- A correct approach would involve checking if either dimension is greater than 1. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is greater than 1, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program's logic is flawed, particularly in the conditions used to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Final: **False**
