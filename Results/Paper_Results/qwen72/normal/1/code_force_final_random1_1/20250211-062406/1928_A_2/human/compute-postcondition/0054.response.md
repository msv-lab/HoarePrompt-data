Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even and `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and `t` is 0. **
