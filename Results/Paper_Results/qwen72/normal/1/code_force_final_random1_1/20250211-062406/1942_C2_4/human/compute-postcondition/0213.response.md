Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The condition that `x` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The value of `t1` remains `(a[0] + 1) % n`.
- The new variable `t2` is assigned the value `(a[0] + 2) % n`.
