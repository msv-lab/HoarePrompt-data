Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * y` if `y < gap // 2` before the subtraction, otherwise `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2) + gap` before the subtraction, `odd` and `even` remain the same, `y` is `0`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
