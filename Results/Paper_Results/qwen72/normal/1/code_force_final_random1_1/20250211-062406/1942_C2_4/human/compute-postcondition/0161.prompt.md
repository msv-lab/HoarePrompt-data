Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers for each test case such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains a specific integer within the range \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` remains an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\), `y` is updated to `y - sum(c for i in val[:k] where k is the index where the loop breaks or completes)`, `l` remains a sorted list containing the values returned by the function `R()` and the new element `n + l[0]`, `val` remains sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `sx` is updated to `sx + sum(i for i in val[:k]) + (y * 2 if y < c else 0)`, `i` is the last element in `val` processed by the loop, and `cons` is updated to `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`, `val` remains a non-empty list sorted such that even numbers come before odd numbers, and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `i` is the last element processed from `val`, `c` is the last computed value of `i // 2`, `y` is the original `y` minus the sum of all `c` values computed during the loop, `sx` is the original `sx` plus the sum of all `i` values processed in the loop, plus `y * 2` if `y < c` for any iteration where this condition was met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is the last element of `val`, `val` remains a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is the last element of `val` divided by 2, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c` (if such a condition occurs) or the sum of all elements in `val` plus any additional adjustments based on the `y < c` condition, `y` is reduced by the sum of the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 up to the point where the loop breaks (if it does), `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
