To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(x):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is `x - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop's execution condition. The loop will start with `i` being 0 and will iterate `x` times.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `x - 1`
- `x` is an input integer

For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` does not matter because the loop will reset `i` to 0 when it starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `x` is greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**
