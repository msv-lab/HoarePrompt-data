Postcondition: ***`i` is the third element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `(third element of val) // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + (second element of val)`. If `y < c`, then `sx` is further updated to `sx + y * 2` and `y` is `y - 2 * (second element of val) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` remains as `y - 2 * (second element of val) // 2`.***
