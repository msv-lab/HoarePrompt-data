Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `a` is not equal to 2. Additionally, the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `a` is even, and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus one.**
