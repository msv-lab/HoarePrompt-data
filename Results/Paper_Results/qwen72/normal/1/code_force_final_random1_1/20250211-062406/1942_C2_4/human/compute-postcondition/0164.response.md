The value of `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. The value of `y` depends on its previous condition: if `y` was less than the previous `gap // 2`, then `y` is now 0; otherwise, `y` is decreased by the previous `gap // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and if `y` was less than the previous `gap // 2`, then `y` is now 0, otherwise `y` is decreased by the previous `gap // 2`.

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and if `y` was less than the previous `gap // 2`, then `y` is now 0, otherwise `y` is decreased by the previous `gap // 2`.**
