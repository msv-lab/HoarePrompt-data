Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `tmp` is a list that now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` in addition to its previous contents, `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**
