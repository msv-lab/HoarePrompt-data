Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop's operations. Additionally, the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and the expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2` evaluates to 0.**
