Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * y` (where `y` was updated based on the condition), `odd` and `even` remain the same, `y` is `0`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
