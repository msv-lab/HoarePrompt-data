Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` remains unchanged, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, and `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order. The list `odd` is also sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd and must have at least 1 element, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order, `odd` is also sorted in ascending order, `gap` is the first element in the list `odd`, `y` is `y - gap // 2`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd and must have at least 1 element, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order, `odd` is also sorted in ascending order, `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`, `y` is `y - gap // 2`. If `y < gap // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd and must have at least 1 element, and is sorted in ascending order, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, and is sorted in ascending order, `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`, `y` is `y - gap // 2`. If `y < gap // 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
