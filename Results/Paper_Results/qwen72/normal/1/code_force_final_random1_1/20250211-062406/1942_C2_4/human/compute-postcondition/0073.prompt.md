Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `tmp` is a list. If the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If the difference is not 2 and does not meet the above condition, `ans` remains `x + y - 2` and `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list that may contain the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)` or `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `tmp` is a list that may contain the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` or `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` in addition to its previous contents, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[3] - a[2] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`. If none of these conditions are met, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
