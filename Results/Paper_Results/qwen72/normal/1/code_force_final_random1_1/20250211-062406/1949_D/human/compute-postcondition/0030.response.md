Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input string. For each index `k` from 0 to `n-1`, if the character at index `k` of `x` is 'F', then both `a[1]` and `a[k+1]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `k` of `x` is 'S', then both `b[1]` and `b[k+1]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `k` of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then neither `a[1]` nor `b[1]` nor `a[k+1]` nor `b[k+1]` is incremented.**
