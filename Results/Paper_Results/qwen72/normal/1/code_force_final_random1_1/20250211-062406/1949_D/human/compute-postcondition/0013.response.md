Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 1, the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F', the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', and `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index 1 of the list `b` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `b[1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
