To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 2
- `nx` is determined based on the character at position `[2][1]` of the string `xx[2]`

Code Snippet:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `i` is 2.
2. The value of `j` is 2.
3. The expression `j - 1` evaluates to 1.
4. The expression `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[2][1]`.
5. The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[2][1]` to it.

Since `nx` was initially determined based on the character at position `[2][1]` of the string `xx[2]`, and now we are adding the same character value again, `nx` will be the sum of its initial value and the value of `xx[2][1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 2
- `nx` is the sum of its initial value (based on `xx[2][1]`) and the value of `xx[2][1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the sum of its initial value (based on `xx[2][1]`) and the value of `xx[2][1]`.**
