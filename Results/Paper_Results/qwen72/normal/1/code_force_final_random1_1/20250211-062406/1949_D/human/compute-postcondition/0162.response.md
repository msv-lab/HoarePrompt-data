The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` is initially determined based on the character at position `[2][1]` of the string `xx[2]`, the new value of `nx` will be the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.**
