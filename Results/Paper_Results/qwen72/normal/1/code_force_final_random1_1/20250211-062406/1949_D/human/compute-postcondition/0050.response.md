Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x`, and `j` is 2. If the character at index 1 of `x` (i.e., `x[j-1]`) is 'F', then `a[2]` is incremented by 1, and `b` remains unchanged. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are each incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
