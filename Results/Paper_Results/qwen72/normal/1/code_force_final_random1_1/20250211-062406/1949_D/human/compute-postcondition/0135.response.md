Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `j` is 2.
- The variable `nx` is initially set based on conditions involving the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` and the elements of `sa`.
- The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` concatenates the character at position `[1][0]` (since `j - 1` is 1) in the array `xx` to the existing value of `nx`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the character at position `[1][1]` in `xx` is concatenated to `nx`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The final value of `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx`.
