The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 24, the loop will definitely execute. However, the initial value of `j` in the loop head should be 1 for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` starts from 1, and `n` remains within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 24).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string**
