Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x`, `j` is `n`, and `xx` has one additional element which is the new input string `x`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least once, `j` is 1, and `xx` has one additional element which is the new input string `x`. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `xx` includes `x` twice and `a[1]` is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the value at index 1 of `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least once, and `j` is 2. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'F', `xx` includes `x` twice and `a[1]` is increased by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'S', the value at index 1 of `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of `b` remains unchanged. Additionally, if the character at index 1 of `x` is 'S', `b[2]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least once, `j` is 3. If the character at index 2 (j-1) of `x` is 'F', then `a[3]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 2 (j-1) of `x` is 'S', then `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
