The provided code snippet initializes `nx` to an empty string. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `j`, nor does it alter the construction logic described in the initial state. However, since `nx` is set to an empty string, any previous content in `nx` (if there was any) is cleared.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.**
