The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3, `a[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[1]` is now `a[1] + 1`, `b[1]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.**
