Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 1, and the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in `xx` is `?`. Additionally, `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, and `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`.
- Initially, `nx` was an empty string, so after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`) and conditions remain unchanged.
