The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is 3, the value at `a[3]` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `xx`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least once, `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1.**
