Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. If `xx[2][2]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[2][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is updated to include an additional 'F' character. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is updated to include an additional 'S' character.***
