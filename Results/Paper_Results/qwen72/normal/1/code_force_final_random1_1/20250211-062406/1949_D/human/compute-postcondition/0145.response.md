Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[1][2]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[1][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` is either the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, or `nx` is a string that has been appended with 'S' otherwise.***
