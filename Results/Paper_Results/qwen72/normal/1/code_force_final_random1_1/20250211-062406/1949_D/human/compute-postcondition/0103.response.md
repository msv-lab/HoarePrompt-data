Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings, `i` is 2. If `b[2] > 0` and `a[2] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing `[2]`. Otherwise, if `a[2] > 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `a[1]` was greater than 0 and `b[1]` was 0, otherwise `sa` is a list containing `[2]`. If `b[2]` is greater than 0 and `a[2]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing `[1]`; otherwise, `sb` is an empty list.***
