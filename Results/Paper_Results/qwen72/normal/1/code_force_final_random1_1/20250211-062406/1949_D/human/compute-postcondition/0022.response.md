Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are each incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then neither `a[1]` nor `b[1]` nor `b[2]` is incremented.***
