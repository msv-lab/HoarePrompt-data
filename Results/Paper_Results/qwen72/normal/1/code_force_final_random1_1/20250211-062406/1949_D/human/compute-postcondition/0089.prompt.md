Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and j-th scenarios, and can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (i = j, no transition). At most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided, and the matrix is symmetric. `a` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0. `b` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0. `xx` is a list containing an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the input string `x`. The arrays `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x`, `j` is `n`, and `xx` has one additional element which is the new input string `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least twice, and `j` is `n`. The values of `a` and `b` at indices other than those specified remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
