Postcondition: ***After the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is decreased by 1 and `flag` remains True. Otherwise, `count` and `flag` retain their original values.***
