Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different. If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 1, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` consists of '0' followed by '1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, and `count` remains unchanged.***
