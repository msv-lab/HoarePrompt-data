Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a new input string, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 1, `flag` is False, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `count` is 2. Additionally, if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` remains False. If `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, `count` remains 1 and `flag` remains False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `count` is 3; if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, `count` is 2. If `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` remains False. If `s[1]` (which is `s[j-1]`) is '0' and `s[2]` (which is `s[j]`) is '1', `flag` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 3, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `count` is 4 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` and `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`, otherwise `count` is 3 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` or `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`, otherwise `count` is 2. `flag` is True if `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains as initially defined (True if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1' or if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', otherwise False).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
