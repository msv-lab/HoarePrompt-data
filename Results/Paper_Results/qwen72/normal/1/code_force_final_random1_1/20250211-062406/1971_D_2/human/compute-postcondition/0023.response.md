Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 3, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is 4 if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` and 3 if `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains as initially defined (True if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1' or if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', otherwise False).***
