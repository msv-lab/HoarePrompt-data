To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to start. In this case, the loop is controlled by the value returned from `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.
- The key factor is the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input read from `sys.stdin` is a valid integer and that this integer is greater than 0.

State: **The input read from `sys.stdin` must be a valid integer greater than 0.**
