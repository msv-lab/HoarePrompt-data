Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is '12' correctly for the AM period. According to the problem description, '12:00' in 24-hour format should convert to '12:00 AM' in 12-hour format, but the current implementation would incorrectly output '12:00 PM'. This is because the condition `int(h) >= 12` is used to determine whether to append 'AM' or 'PM', which incorrectly classifies '12:00' as PM.
