Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `s` is a string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string.
  - If `h` is '00', the value of `h` remains '00'.
  - Otherwise, if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12.
  - If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `h` from `s`:**
   - `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "1430"`, then `h = "14"`.

2. **Evaluating the Condition `int(h) >= 12`:**
   - If `h` is '00', it remains '00' and `int(h) == 0`, which is not greater than or equal to 12.
   - If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the condition `int(h) >= 12` is `False`.
   - If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the condition `int(h) >= 12` is `True`.

3. **Selecting 'AM' or 'PM':**
   - The expression `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will select 'AM' if `int(h) < 12` and 'PM' if `int(h) >= 12`.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end.
   - The result of the `print` statement will be the concatenation of `s[2:]` and the selected 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s = "1430"`, then `h = "14"`, `int(h) = 14`, and `int(h) >= 12` is `True`.
  - `s[2:] = "30"`.
  - The output will be: `30 PM`.

- If `s = "0945"`, then `h = "09"`, `int(h) = 9`, and `int(h) >= 12` is `False`.
  - `s[2:] = "45"`.
  - The output will be: `45 AM`.

- If `s = "0015"`, then `h = "00"`, `int(h) = 0`, and `int(h) >= 12` is `False`.
  - `s[2:] = "15"`.
  - The output will be: `15 AM`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
Output: **s[2:] followed by 'AM' if int(h) < 12, or 'PM' if int(h) >= 12 (where s[2:] is the substring of s starting from the third character to the end, and h is the first two characters of s as a string)**.
