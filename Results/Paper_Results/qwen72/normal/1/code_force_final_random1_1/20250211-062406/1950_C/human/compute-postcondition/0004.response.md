Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string, and the value of `h` is '00'.

The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print('12', end='')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'12'`.
- The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline character is added after the printed string, meaning the cursor will remain on the same line after the print statement is executed.

Since the `print` statement does not involve any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `h`, the output will simply be the string `'12'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **12**
