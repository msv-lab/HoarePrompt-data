Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer, and `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string. If `h` is '00', the value of `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12. If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` is greater than 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer, and `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string. If `h` is '00', the value of `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12. If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` is greater than 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer, and `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string. If `h` is '00', the value of `h` remains '00'. If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12. If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` is greater than 12.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
