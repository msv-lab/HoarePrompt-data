The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a list containing two items: the first item is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second item is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the smallest year `current_year` such that for each element `ai` in the corresponding list `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. Each `current_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` elements, where each element is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` of `t` elements, where each element is the smallest year `current_year` that is a multiple of all integers in the corresponding list from `test_cases`.**
