Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, each element being a list with two items: the first item is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second item is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the smallest year `current_year` such that for each element `ai` in the corresponding list `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
- **`test_cases`**: This list remains unchanged as it contains the input data for each test case.
- **`results`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `results` will contain `t` elements. Each element in `results` corresponds to a test case from `test_cases` and represents the smallest year `current_year` that is a multiple of all the periodicities in the list `a` for that test case. This means that for each test case, the loop calculates the smallest year when all signs will align based on their periodicities.
