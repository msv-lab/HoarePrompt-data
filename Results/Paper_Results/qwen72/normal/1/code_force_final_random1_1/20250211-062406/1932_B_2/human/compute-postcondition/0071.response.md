Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the smallest year `current_year` such that for each element `ai` in the corresponding list `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. Each `current_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding list `a`.**
