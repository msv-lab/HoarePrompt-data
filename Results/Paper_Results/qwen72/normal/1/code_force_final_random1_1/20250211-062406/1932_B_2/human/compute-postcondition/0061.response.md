Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, where `ai` is the second item of the iterable `a`.***
