Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `ai` is the second item of the iterable `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
- All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
