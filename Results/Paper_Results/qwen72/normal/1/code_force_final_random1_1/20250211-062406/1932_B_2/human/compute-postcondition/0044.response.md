Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test` and must contain at least four elements. `ai` is the fourth element of `a`. `current_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`, and `next_year` remains the same as its previous value.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to the value of `next_year`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `ai`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `next_year` does not change and remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.
