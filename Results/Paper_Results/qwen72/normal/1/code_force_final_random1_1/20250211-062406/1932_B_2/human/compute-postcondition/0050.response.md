To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements.
- `test` is the third element of `test_cases`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`.
- `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`.
- `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases`.
- `current_year` is now 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for ai in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `ai` and the iterable `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must be an iterable with at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `a` must be a non-empty iterable. Since `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases`, we need to ensure that this element is a non-empty iterable.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `current_year`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is 0**
