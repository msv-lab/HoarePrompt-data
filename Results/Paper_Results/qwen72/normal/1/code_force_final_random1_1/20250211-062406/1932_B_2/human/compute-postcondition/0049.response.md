Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `current_year` and the second element is also `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases`, and `current_year` is now 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `current_year` is the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop, which is determined based on the conditions involving the elements of `a`.
- The code snippet sets `current_year` to 0, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `current_year` is 0, and this is reflected in the output state.
