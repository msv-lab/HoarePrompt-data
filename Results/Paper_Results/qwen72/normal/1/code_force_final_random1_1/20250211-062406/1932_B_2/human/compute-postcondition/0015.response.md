The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

- `t` remains greater than 0 and is unchanged.
- `n` is a new input integer and is unchanged.
- `a` is now a list of integers from the user input.
- `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in `a`, and is unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in `a`.**
