Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a list containing two items: the first item is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second item is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a list containing two items: the first item is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second item is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `test` is the first element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test`, and `current_year` is the smallest year such that for each element `ai` in `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `current_year` and the second element is also `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test`, and `current_year` is the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop. The value of `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the largest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a` that are not multiples of any smaller element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are `current_year` and the third element is also `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` according to the loop logic.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
