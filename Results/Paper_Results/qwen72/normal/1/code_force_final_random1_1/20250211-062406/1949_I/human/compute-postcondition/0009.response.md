Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the second element is an input integer, `y` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the second element is an input integer, `r` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the second element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the second elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` to the values obtained from the user input, which are split and converted to integers. The first elements of these lists remain unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `visited`, `coef`, and `i`) are not affected.
