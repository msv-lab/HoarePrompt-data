Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` from user input. It then processes these lists to determine if the graph represented by these lists is bipartite and if there are any nodes in the graph. The function updates a `visited` list to track visited nodes and a `coef` list to assign coefficients during the processing. After processing, the function prints 'YES' if the graph is bipartite and contains at least one node, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes `visited` being fully marked as `True`, `coef` containing assigned integer values, and `tot` reflecting the number of nodes processed. **
