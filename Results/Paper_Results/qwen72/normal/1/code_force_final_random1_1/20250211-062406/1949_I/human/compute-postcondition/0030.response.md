Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where `visited[i]` is `True` and other elements may be `True` or `False` depending on the traversal, `coef` is a list where `coef[i]` is 1 and other elements may be 1 or `None` depending on the traversal, `i` is `n-2`, `tot` is updated based on the DFS traversal (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph structure, `ok` is `True` if `ok` was initially `True` or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` was initially `True`, the values of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remain unchanged.***
