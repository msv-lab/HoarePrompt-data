Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `coef = [None] * n` initializes the list `coef` to have `None` values of length `n`. Since `n` is already defined and is an integer between 1 and 1000, the length of `coef` is the same as the length of `x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
