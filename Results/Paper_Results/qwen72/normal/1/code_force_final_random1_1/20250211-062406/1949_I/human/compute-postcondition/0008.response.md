The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 1), and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the rest are `None`, `y` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the rest are `None`, `r` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the rest are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is 1**
