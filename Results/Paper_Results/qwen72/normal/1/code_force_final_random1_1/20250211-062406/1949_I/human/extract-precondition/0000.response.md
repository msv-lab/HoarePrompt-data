Precondition: **i is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. n is the total number of disks, x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the disk centers, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9. r is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited during the DFS traversal. tot is an integer representing the total sum of coefficients. bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the graph is bipartite. coef is a list of integers representing the coefficient of each disk, initially set to 1 or -1.**
