Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. a is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. If no input strings contained any '1', `k` remains an empty list. If `k[0] == k[1]`, the first two elements of `k` are equal. Otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is a positive integer equal to the value of `t`, `b` is the last user input string. The list `k` contains the counts of '1's from each input string `b` where '1' was present, and its length is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged. Additionally, if the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `_` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `b` is the last input string provided during the final iteration. The list `k` contains the counts of '1' characters from each input string `b` where '1' was present, in the order the inputs were received. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. Additionally, the first element of `k` is either equal to or not equal to the second element of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
