Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10) represented by '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines whether the shape formed by '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle. It prints "SQUARE" if the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same, indicating a square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the shape type for each test case. The original values of `t`, `n`, and the grid remain unchanged. **
