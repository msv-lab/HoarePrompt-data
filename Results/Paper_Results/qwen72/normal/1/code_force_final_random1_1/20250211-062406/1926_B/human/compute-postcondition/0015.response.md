Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an input string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the string `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1's in the string `b` to the list `k`.
- If `b` contains at least one '1', the list `k` now contains the count of '1's in `b`.
- If `b` does not contain any '1', `k` remains an empty list, but since the precondition states that `b` contains at least one '1', `k` will contain the count of '1's in `b`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
