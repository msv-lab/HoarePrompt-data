Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `_` is 0, indicating that the inner loop has completed all iterations for each test case. The list `k` contains the counts of '1' characters from each input string `b` where '1' was present, in the order the inputs were received. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and the grid remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `b` is the last input string provided during the final iteration. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds true, and "SQUARE" is printed. Otherwise, "TRIANGLE" is printed.**
