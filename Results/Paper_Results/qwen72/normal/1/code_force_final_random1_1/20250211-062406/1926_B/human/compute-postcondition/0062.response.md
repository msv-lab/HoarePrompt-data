Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- `b` is the last input string provided during the final iteration.
- The list `k` contains the counts of '1' characters from each input string `b` where '1' was present, in the order the inputs were received.
- The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

The print statement is:
```python
print('SQUARE')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **SQUARE**
