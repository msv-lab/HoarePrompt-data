Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `k = []` reinitializes the list `k` to an empty list, overriding any previous contents. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
