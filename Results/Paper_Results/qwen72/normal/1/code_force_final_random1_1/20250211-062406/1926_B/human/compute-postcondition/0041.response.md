Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a positive integer equal to the value of `t`.
- `b` is the last user input string.
- The list `k` contains the counts of '1's from each input string `b` where '1' was present, and its length is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'.
- The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('SQUARE')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **SQUARE**
