Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks the first two rows of the grid that contain '1's to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This approach fails in scenarios where the shape is more complex and requires checking the entire structure of the grid.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following input:

```
1
4
0010
0111
1111
1111
```

This grid represents a square, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a triangle because it only checks the first two rows containing '1's, which do not have the same number of '1's. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
