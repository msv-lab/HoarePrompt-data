The value of `b` is a user input string, and the method `b.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `b`. This count is then appended to the list `k`. Since `k` was mentioned to remain unchanged, it implies that `k` was already a list before this operation. After appending, `k` now includes one additional element which is the count of '1's in `b`.

Output State: **`_` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` is a user input string, `k` is a list with an additional element representing the count of '1's in `b`.**
