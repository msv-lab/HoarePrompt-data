You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `_` is 0, indicating that the inner loop has completed all iterations for each test case. The list `k` contains the counts of '1' characters from each input string `b` where '1' was present, in the order the inputs were received. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and the grid remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `b` is the last input string provided during the final iteration. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds true, and "SQUARE" is printed. Otherwise, "TRIANGLE" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid of size n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) represented by '0's and '1's. It returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in each grid for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
