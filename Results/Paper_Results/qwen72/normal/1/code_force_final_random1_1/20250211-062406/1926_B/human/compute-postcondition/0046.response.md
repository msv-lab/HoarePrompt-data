Output State: **`_` is a positive integer equal to the value of `t`, `b` is the last user input string, `k` is an empty list, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged, and the first element of `k` no longer exists (as `k` is now an empty list). The loop cannot execute again because `i` is already equal to `a`.**
