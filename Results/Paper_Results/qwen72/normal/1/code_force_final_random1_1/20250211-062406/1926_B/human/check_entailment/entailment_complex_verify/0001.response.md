Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input. It stores the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' in the list `k`.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', indicating that the shape is a square.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE', indicating that the shape is a triangle.

3. **Assumptions and Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
   - The function relies on the assumption that the first two rows containing '1's will be sufficient to determine the shape. This is generally true for the given constraints and problem description.
   - However, the function does not explicitly check for the exact structure of the triangle or square beyond the first two rows. This could be a potential issue if the input were more complex, but given the constraints, it should work correctly.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function assumes that the first two rows containing '1's will be sufficient to determine the shape. This is a reasonable assumption given the constraints and the nature of the shapes (triangle and square).
   - The function does not handle cases where the grid might have more complex patterns, but the problem constraints ensure that such cases do not occur.

Given the problem constraints and the simplicity of the shapes (triangle and square), the function appears to correctly identify the shape based on the provided logic.

Final: **True**
