To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the input value must be greater than 0**
