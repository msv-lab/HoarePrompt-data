The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` based on the values of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.

The code snippet:
```python
a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
```
- `i` is 3, so `a[3]` is updated to `a[2] + x[2]`.
- `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- `x[2]` is the third element of the list `x`.

Therefore, `a[3]` becomes `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3.**
