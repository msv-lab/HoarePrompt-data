Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must be between 2 and 500.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `a` is still defined based on the initial conditions, and `i` is still `n-1`.
