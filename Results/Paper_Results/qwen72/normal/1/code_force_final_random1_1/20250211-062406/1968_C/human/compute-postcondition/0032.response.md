Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[1]` is updated to `a[0] + x[0]`.
- Since `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` becomes `1000 + x[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
