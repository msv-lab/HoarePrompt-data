Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution initializes `a[0]` with a fixed value of 1000. This approach may not always work because the value of `a[0]` should be chosen such that it can satisfy the condition `x_2 = a_2 % a_1` for the given `x_2`. The value of 1000 might not be large enough in some cases, and it doesn't guarantee that the subsequent values of `a` will correctly satisfy the conditions for all possible inputs.

A correct approach would be to initialize `a[0]` with a value that is greater than the maximum possible value of `x[i]` (which is 500 according to the problem constraints), and then construct the array `a` accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = max(x) + 1  # Ensure a[0] is greater than any x[i]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

This ensures that `a[0]` is always large enough to satisfy the conditions for all `x[i]`, and the subsequent values of `a` are constructed correctly.
