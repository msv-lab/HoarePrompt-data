The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` by setting it to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000
- `i` is 2
- `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`

Let's calculate the new value of `a[2]`:

- `a[i]` is `a[2]`
- `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, which is `1000 + x[0]`
- `x[i - 1]` is `x[1]`

So, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`, which is `(1000 + x[0]) + x[1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `i` is 2.**
