Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is now `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is now `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[2]` (since `i` is 2) to be the sum of `a[1]` and `x[1]`.
- Given that `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, the new value of `a[2]` becomes `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
