Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`. This state is repeated for each of the `t` test cases.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and for each of the `t` test cases, the following conditions hold:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, inclusive.
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers, each within the range 1 to 500.
- `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
- The loop variable `i` reaches `n-1` for each test case, indicating that the inner loop has completed its execution for that test case.
