To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `a`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` where:
  - `a[0]` is 1000.
  - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 + the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
- `i` is `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Construction of List `a`:
1. The first element of `a` is always 1000.
2. For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where \(1 \leq i < n\)):
   - `a[i]` is calculated as 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 4` and `x = [1, 2, 3]`:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 1 = 1001`
- `a[2] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1]) = 1000 + (1 + 2) = 1003`
- `a[3] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + x[2]) = 1000 + (1 + 2 + 3) = 1006`

So, the list `a` would be `[1000, 1001, 1003, 1006]`.

### General Case:
For any given `n` and `x`, the list `a` will be constructed as follows:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1])`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])`

### Print Statement:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + (x[0] + x[1]), ..., 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])** (where `x` is the list of integers read from the input and `n` is the length of the list `a`).
