Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it constructs the array `a`. Specifically, the way `a` is constructed does not guarantee that the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will construct the array `a` as follows:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + 2 = 1002`
- `a[2] = 1002 + 4 = 1006`
- `a[3] = 1006 + 1 = 1007`

So, the output will be:
```
1000 1002 1006 1007
```

However, this does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \):
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 \neq 2 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 \)

Thus, the program fails to produce a valid array `a` for this input, making it incorrect.
