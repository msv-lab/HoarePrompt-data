The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is now `1000 + x[0]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
