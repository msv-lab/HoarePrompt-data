The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index corresponds to the position from the end of the original string `arr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1)
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is the new input string with all spaces removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`
- `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string

After executing the code snippet:
- `y` is updated to the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` (since `arr[::-1].find('1')` gives the index from the end, which translates to the last occurrence in the original string).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**
