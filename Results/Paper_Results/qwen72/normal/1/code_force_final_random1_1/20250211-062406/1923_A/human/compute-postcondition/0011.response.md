The provided Python code snippet updates the value of `arr` by taking a new input, removing all spaces, and joining the characters together into a single string.

- `arr` is updated to the input string with all spaces removed.
- `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, but their values depend on the new value of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the new `arr`, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**
