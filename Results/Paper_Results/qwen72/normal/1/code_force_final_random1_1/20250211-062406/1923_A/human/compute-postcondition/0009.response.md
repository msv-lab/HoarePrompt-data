The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr', `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr', `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string**
