The code snippet `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` reads an input from the user, splits it by spaces (removing them), and then joins the resulting list back into a single string without spaces. This means `arr` will contain the input string with all spaces removed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the state changes as follows:
- `arr` is assigned the value of the input string with all spaces removed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed.**
