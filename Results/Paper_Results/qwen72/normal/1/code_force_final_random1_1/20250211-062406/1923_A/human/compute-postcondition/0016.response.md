Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: Must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
2. **`n`**: An input integer.
3. **`arr`**: A new input string with all spaces removed.
4. **`x`**: The index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
5. **`y`**: The index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found.
6. **`z`**: The substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Remove Spaces from `arr`**:
   - `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed. For example, if the input string is `"a b c 1 d e"`, then `arr` becomes `"abc1de"`.

2. **Find `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.

3. **Determine `z`**:
   - If `x` and `y` are valid (i.e., both are not `-1`) and `n - y > x`, then `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `z` is an empty string.

4. **Count '0' in `z`**:
   - The `print` statement will print the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z`.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1**:
   - Input: `arr = "a b c 1 d e 1 f g"`, `n = 13`
   - After removing spaces: `arr = "abc1de1fg"`
   - `x = 3` (index of the first '1')
   - `y = 6` (index of the last '1')
   - `n - y - 1 = 13 - 6 - 1 = 6`
   - `z = arr[3:6] = "1de"`
   - `z.count('0') = 0`
   - Output: **0**

2. **Scenario 2**:
   - Input: `arr = "a b c 1 d e"`, `n = 10`
   - After removing spaces: `arr = "abc1de"`
   - `x = 3` (index of the first '1')
   - `y = 3` (index of the last '1')
   - `n - y - 1 = 10 - 3 - 1 = 6`
   - Since `n - y > x` is not true, `z` is an empty string.
   - `z.count('0') = 0`
   - Output: **0**

3. **Scenario 3**:
   - Input: `arr = "a b c d e"`, `n = 10`
   - After removing spaces: `arr = "abcde"`
   - `x = -1` (no '1' found)
   - `y = -1` (no '1' found)
   - `z` is an empty string.
   - `z.count('0') = 0`
   - Output: **0**

### General Case:
- If `arr` does not contain '1', `x` and `y` will both be `-1`, making `z` an empty string.
- If `arr` contains '1' but `n - y <= x`, `z` will be an empty string.
- In both cases, `z.count('0')` will be `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 (where 0 is the count of '0' in the substring `z`)**
