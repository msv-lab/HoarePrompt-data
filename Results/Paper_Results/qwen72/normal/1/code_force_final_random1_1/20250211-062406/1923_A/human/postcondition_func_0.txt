The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a sequence of `n` integers (0s and 1s) representing the state of cells. The function calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last occupied cells (1s) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` as described in the annotations.
