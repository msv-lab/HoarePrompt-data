Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of cells `n`.
   - It reads the array `arr` representing the cells, removes spaces, and converts it to a string.
   - It finds the index of the first chip (`x`) and the index of the last chip from the right (`y`).
   - It extracts the substring `z` that contains only the cells between the first and last chips (inclusive).
   - It counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in this substring and prints the count.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block is calculated correctly. The number of free cells between the first and last chips is indeed the minimum number of moves required, as each move will place a chip in the next available free cell to the left.
