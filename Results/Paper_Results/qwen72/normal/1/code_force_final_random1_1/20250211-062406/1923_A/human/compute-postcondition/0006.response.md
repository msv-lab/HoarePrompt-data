Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string.
- This effectively gives the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`.
- If '1' is not found in `arr`, `y` will be `-1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
