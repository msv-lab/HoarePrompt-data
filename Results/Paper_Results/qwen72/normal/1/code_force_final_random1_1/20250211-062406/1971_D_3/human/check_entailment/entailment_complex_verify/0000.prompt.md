You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` is the last input string provided with a length greater than 1, `t` is the initial value provided, `i` is `t - 1`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different. If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 1, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` consists of '0' followed by '1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, and `count` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It calculates the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different, adjusting the count if a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the adjusted counts have been printed for each input string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the string has multiple consecutive '1's followed by '0's correctly. For example, consider the input `11100`. The correct output should be `2` because we can split the string into two pieces: `111` and `00`, which can be rearranged to form the sorted binary string `00111`.

However, the given program will output `3` for this input. This is because the program increments the `count` every time it encounters a change in character, but it does not account for the fact that once a '1' is encountered after a '0', no further splits are necessary to ensure the string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
