Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the string has multiple consecutive '1's followed by '0's correctly. For example, consider the input `11100`. The correct output should be `2` because we can split the string into two pieces: `111` and `00`, which can be rearranged to form the sorted binary string `00111`.

However, the given program will output `3` for this input. This is because the program increments the `count` every time it encounters a change in character, but it does not account for the fact that once a '1' is encountered after a '0', no further splits are necessary to ensure the string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
