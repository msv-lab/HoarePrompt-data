The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by five parameters: `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m`. Here, `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, with each test case having:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of messages,
- `f`: an integer representing the initial phone's charge,
- `a`: an integer representing the charge consumption per unit of time,
- `b`: an integer representing the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on,
- `m`: a list of `n` integers representing the moments at which messages need to be sent.

For each test case, the function evaluates whether the phone can send all the messages without running out of charge, considering the charge consumption and the moments of message sending. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether the phone can successfully send all messages (`True`) or not (`False`).

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m` at which messages need to be sent. It returns a list of boolean values, where each value indicates whether the phone can successfully send all messages for the corresponding test case.**
