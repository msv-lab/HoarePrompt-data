Output State: **`array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` to `array2`. Since `i` is 1, the condition for appending this value is met, and `array2` now contains this value. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
