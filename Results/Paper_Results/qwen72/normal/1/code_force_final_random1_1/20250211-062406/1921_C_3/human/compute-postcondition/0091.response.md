The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was at some value, and `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is defined by the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`array2` is an empty list or contains one element. If `i` is 1 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is not 1 and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains empty. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input. `i` is 1.**
