Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the results of `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), so after all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `array2` will contain the results of the expression `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is satisfied.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
