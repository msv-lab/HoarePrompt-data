Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. While this is a valid scenario where Bob can form another rectangle, it is not the only scenario. For example, a 2x3 rectangle can also be cut into two 2x1 rectangles and reformed into a 1x6 rectangle.

2. The conditions involving `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and do not make logical sense in the context of the problem.

3. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true because the result of a modulo operation is either 0 or a positive number. This condition does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle.

A correct approach would be to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This version correctly checks if either dimension is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle.
