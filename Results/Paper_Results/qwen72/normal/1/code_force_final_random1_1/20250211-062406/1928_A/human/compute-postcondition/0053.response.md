The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it appears that the function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers within the range 1 to 10^9, and an additional parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range from 1 to 10^4.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the function likely processes each test case defined by `t` and performs some operation involving `a` and `b`. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume a generic operation (for example, calculating the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case) and describe the functionality accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, `a` and `b`, which are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the operation performed on `a` and `b`.**
