The code snippet `a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on whitespace, and assigns these parts as integers to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- The result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (this condition is not directly relevant to the current code snippet, but it indicates that the input should be valid and positive integers).

After executing the code:
- `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the input.**
