### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step by step.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Determining if Another Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if another rectangle can be formed:
     - **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - This condition checks if both dimensions `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, it prints 'yes'. This is correct because an even-by-even rectangle can always be cut into smaller even-by-even rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. The tuple comparison `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` does not make sense in this context. It is not a valid logical check for determining if another rectangle can be formed.
     - **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. If the difference is odd, it prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because the difference being odd does not necessarily mean that another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x3 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
     - **Else Condition:** `else`
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - To determine if another rectangle can be formed, we need to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If either `a` or `b` is even, then the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If `a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`, print 'yes'.
     - Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program contains logical errors and incorrect conditions. The correct logic should be simpler and more straightforward, as outlined in the corrected program.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This corrected program will correctly determine if another rectangle can be formed based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the logical errors in the provided program. The program as given is incorrect.

Final: **False**
