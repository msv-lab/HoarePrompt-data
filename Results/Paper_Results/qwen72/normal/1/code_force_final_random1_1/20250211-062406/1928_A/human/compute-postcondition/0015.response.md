The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop's execution depends on the value of `i` being less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, then the respective condition holds. Otherwise, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd (not divisible by 2) or even (divisible by 2).**
