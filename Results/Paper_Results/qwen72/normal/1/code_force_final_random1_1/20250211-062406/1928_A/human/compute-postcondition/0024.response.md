The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the range defined by the user input. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment by 1, making it 2, and the range defined by the user input must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, then the respective condition holds. Otherwise, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd (not divisible by 2) or even (divisible by 2). The range defined by the user input must be greater than 1.**
