Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the input, and at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. Additionally, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true. If the difference `(a - b)` is odd, then the difference is not divisible by 2. If the difference `(a - b)` is even, then the difference is divisible by 2.***
