The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. Given that `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and `t` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `b` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
