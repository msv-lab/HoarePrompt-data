Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`. If `a[0]` was less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- `opNum` is still `a[0]`.
- `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`.
- `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`.
- If `a[0]` (after being updated) is less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged.
