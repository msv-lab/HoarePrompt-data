Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`, `stop` is True.**

Explanation:
- The value of `stop` is set to `True`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `opNum`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`) remain as they were in the initial state, with their values being updated according to the operations specified in the initial state.
