Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the first two and the last two elements of the array to determine if the operation can make all elements zero. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire array and the cumulative effect of the operations.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output "YES" because it only checks the first two elements (`1` and `2`) and the last two elements (`4` and `5`), which do not violate the conditions in the program. However, it is impossible to make all elements of this array zero using the given operation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider the sum of the elements and the parity of the elements in the array. A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and if the elements can be adjusted to zero through the operations. The provided program does not perform these checks, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
