Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 2, `opNum` is equal to `a[2]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `-2 * a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - 2 * a[2]`, `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - a[2]`, `n` must be greater than 4, `a[2]` is now `a[2] - opNum`, `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 2 * opNum`, if `a[2]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `stop` remains False.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - 2 * opNum`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
