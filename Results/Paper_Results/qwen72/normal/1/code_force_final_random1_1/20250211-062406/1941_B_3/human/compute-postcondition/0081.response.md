To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions under which the loop operates:

### Initial State:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`.
- During each iteration, the following updates are made:
  - `a[i] -= a[i]`
  - `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[i]`
  - `a[i + 2] -= a[i]`
- The loop terminates if any of the following conditions are met:
  - `i` reaches `n - 3`.
  - `a[i]` becomes less than 0 for any `i`.
- If the loop terminates because `a[i]` becomes less than 0, the variable `stop` is set to `True`.
- If the loop completes normally without any element in `a` becoming less than 0, `stop` remains `False`.
- The last element of `a` is 0.
- The second-to-last element of `a` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop can terminate either because `i` reaches `n - 3` or because `a[i]` becomes less than 0.
   - If `a[i]` becomes less than 0, `stop` is set to `True`.
   - If the loop completes normally, `stop` remains `False`.

2. **Final State of `a`**:
   - The last element of `a` is 0.
   - The second-to-last element of `a` is 0.
   - This implies that the loop must have completed normally without any element in `a` becoming less than 0, because if any element had become less than 0, the loop would have terminated early and `stop` would be `True`.

3. **Value of `stop`**:
   - Since the loop completed normally, `stop` must be `False`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed after the loop.
   - The presence of this statement suggests that the program is designed to print 'YES' if the loop completes normally without any element in `a` becoming less than 0.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop completed normally and `stop` is `False`, the `print('YES')` statement will execute, printing 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
