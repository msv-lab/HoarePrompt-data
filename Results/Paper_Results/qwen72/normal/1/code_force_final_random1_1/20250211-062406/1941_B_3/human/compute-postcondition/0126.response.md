The function `func` is described without explicit parameters in the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept the following:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of elements in the array.
- An array `a` consisting of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9).

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output or return value for each test case is not explicitly stated in the problem description. Assuming the function is designed to process the array `a` in some way and return a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `a`, and the array `a` itself. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the processing and the returned results are not specified in the given information.**
