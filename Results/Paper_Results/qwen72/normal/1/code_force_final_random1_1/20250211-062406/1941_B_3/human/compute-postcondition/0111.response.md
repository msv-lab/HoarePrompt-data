Output State: **`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input with `a[0]` now equal to 0, `a[1]` is now 0, `a[2]` is decreased by the original value of `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `opNum` is equal to `a[2]`, `a[3]` is unchanged, and `stop` is True if `a[2]` is less than 0. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**
