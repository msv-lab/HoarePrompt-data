Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` has been updated to `0`, `a[n-2]` has been updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` has been updated to `a[n-1] - opNum`, `stop` is False, and either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0, or both `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]` are 0.**
