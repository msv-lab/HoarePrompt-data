Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - a[1]`. If `a[1]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged.**
