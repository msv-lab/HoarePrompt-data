Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `opNum` is `a[0]`.
- `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`.
- `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`.
- `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`.
- `stop` remains unchanged unless `a[0]` was less than 0 in the previous iteration.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
