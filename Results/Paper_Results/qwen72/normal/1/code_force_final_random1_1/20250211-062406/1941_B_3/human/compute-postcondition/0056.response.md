To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, n - 2)`.
   - This means the loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n - 2`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `opNum` is `a[0]`.
   - `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`.
   - `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`.
   - `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`.
   - If `a[0]` was less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Final State**:
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains the same (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`, `stop` remains unchanged unless `a[0]` was less than 0 in the previous iteration.**
