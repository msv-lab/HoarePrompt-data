The function `func` reads multiple integers from the user, each representing an encoded value of a three-letter word. For each integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78), it generates and prints a corresponding three-letter word based on the following rules: If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), the word is the character from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet, followed by 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. The function does not return any value; it only prints the generated words.
