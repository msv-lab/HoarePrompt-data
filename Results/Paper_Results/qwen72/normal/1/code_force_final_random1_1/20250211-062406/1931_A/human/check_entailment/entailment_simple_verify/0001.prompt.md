You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer n as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded value of a three-letter word.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be equal to the input integer minus 1, `n` will be the last input integer provided, and `word` will be a string. The value of `word` will depend on the last input integer `n`: If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), `word` will be the character from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` will be 'a' + the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet + 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` will be 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to a given integer `n`. The sum is calculated based on the position of each letter in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.).

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter at position `n - 53` followed by "zz". This is because the maximum sum for "zzz" is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and any `n` greater than 52 can be represented by a word starting with a letter from "r" to "z" followed by "zz".
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52, the program constructs the word by adding "a" followed by the letter at position `n - 28` and then "z". This is because the maximum sum for "azz" is 52 (1 + 26 + 25), and any `n` in this range can be represented by a word starting with "a" followed by a letter from "a" to "y" and then "z".
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26, the program constructs the word by adding "aa" followed by the letter at position `n - 3`. This is because the maximum sum for "aaa" is 3 (1 + 1 + 1), and any `n` in this range can be represented by a word starting with "aa" followed by a letter from "a" to "z".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is 3, it outputs "aaa" which is the smallest possible word.
   - When `n` is 78, it outputs "zzz" which is the largest possible word.

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by always starting with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increasing the value of the letters as needed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
