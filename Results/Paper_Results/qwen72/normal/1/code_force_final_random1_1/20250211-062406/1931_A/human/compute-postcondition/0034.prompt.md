You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer n as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded value of a three-letter word.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be equal to the input integer minus 1, `n` will be the last input integer provided, and `word` will be a string. The value of `word` will depend on the last input integer `n`: If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), `word` will be the character from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` will be 'a' + the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet + 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` will be 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and returns the corresponding three-letter word based on the encoded value `n`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
