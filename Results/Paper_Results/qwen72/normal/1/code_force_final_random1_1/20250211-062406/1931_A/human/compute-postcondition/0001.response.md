The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0. Since the function is supposed to take an integer `n` as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, we need to ensure that the input is within this range.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive)**
