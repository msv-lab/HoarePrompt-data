Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

For the input `n = 48`, the program outputs `auz`. However, the correct output should be `auz` (which is correct), but let's consider another case:

For the input `n = 55`, the program outputs `czz`. However, the correct output should be `bzz`.

The issue lies in the logic for constructing the word when `n > 52`. The program adds the character at position `n - 53` followed by `zz`, which is not always the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n = 55`, the correct word should be `bzz` (since `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`).

To fix this, the program should correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.
