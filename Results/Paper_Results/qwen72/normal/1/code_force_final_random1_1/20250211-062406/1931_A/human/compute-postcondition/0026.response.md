The code snippet `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends the character from the `alphabet` list at the index `n - 53` followed by the string `'zz'` to the variable `word`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `word` is an empty string

After executing the code:
- `word` is updated to contain the character from `alphabet` at the index `n - 53` followed by `'zz'`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is the string formed by appending the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by `'zz'`.**
