Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is an empty string initially.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, which remains true after the code execution.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
- The value of `word` remains an empty string initially, as no changes are made to `word` in the given code snippet.
