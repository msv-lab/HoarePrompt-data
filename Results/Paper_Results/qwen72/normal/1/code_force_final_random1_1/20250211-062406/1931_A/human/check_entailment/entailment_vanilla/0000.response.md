Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to a given integer `n`. The sum is calculated based on the position of each letter in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.).

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter at position `n - 53` followed by "zz". This is because the maximum sum for "zzz" is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and any `n` greater than 52 can be represented by a word starting with a letter from "r" to "z" followed by "zz".
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52, the program constructs the word by adding "a" followed by the letter at position `n - 28` and then "z". This is because the maximum sum for "azz" is 52 (1 + 26 + 25), and any `n` in this range can be represented by a word starting with "a" followed by a letter from "a" to "y" and then "z".
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26, the program constructs the word by adding "aa" followed by the letter at position `n - 3`. This is because the maximum sum for "aaa" is 3 (1 + 1 + 1), and any `n` in this range can be represented by a word starting with "aa" followed by a letter from "a" to "z".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is 3, it outputs "aaa" which is the smallest possible word.
   - When `n` is 78, it outputs "zzz" which is the largest possible word.

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by always starting with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increasing the value of the letters as needed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
