Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The variable `word` is set to an empty string `''`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for setting the value of `word` based on the value of `n` are not affected by this assignment, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
