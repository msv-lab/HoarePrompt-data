To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped.
   - `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element).
   - `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed.
   - `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop.
   - `p` is equal to `j`.
   - `i` is the last element of `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed.
   - If any element in `s` equals `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is the count of such occurrences.
   - If any element in `s` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks and `z` remains 1.
   - If no element in `s` is greater than `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` after the first occurrence of `h`.
   - Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `h` is the first element of `s`.
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element.
   - `ans1` is determined based on the conditions involving `h` and the elements in `s`.

3. **Determining `max(ans, ans1)`:**
   - We need to compare `ans` and `ans1` to find the maximum value.
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element.
   - `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that meet specific conditions related to `h`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`.

Given the complexity of the conditions and the lack of specific values for `s`, `h`, and other variables, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the provided conditions.

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans is the count of elements in s starting from the second element up to the point where h is no longer greater than or equal to the current element, and ans1 is the count of elements in s that meet specific conditions related to h)**
