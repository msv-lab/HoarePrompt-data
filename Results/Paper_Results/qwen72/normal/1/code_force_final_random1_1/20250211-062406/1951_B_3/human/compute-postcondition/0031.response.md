Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[14]` if the condition `k == 14` is true; `ind` is a list containing the indices of exactly 1 element in `a` that is greater than `x`; `c` is 1, indicating there is exactly 1 element in `a` greater than `x`; `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop, which could be any value from 0 to n-1 depending on when the loop breaks or completes; `n` is the length of the list `a`. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and contains exactly one index, and the first element of `ind` is 0, meaning the element at index 0 in `a` is the only element greater than `x`.**
