You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches where the winner of each match faces the next cow.
   - Our goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by optionally swapping its position with another cow once.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list of ratings.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It extracts the rating of cow `k` and initializes an empty list `ind` to store indices of cows with higher ratings.
   - It iterates through the list to find the first two cows with higher ratings than cow `k`.
   - Depending on the positions of these cows, it calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic:**
   - If there are no cows with a higher rating, cow `k` can win all matches except the last one, so the function returns `n - 1`.
   - If there is only one cow with a higher rating:
     - If this cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `k - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is after cow `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - If there are two cows with higher ratings:
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
     - If cow `k` is after the second higher-rated cow, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic seems to cover all edge cases and correctly handles the scenarios described in the problem statement.
   - The function correctly identifies the positions of the higher-rated cows and calculates the maximum number of wins accordingly.
