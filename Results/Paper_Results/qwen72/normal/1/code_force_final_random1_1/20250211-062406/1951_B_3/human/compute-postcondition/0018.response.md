Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `ind` is a list containing the index 2; `c` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `ind`. Since the condition `a[i] > x` was met, `ind` now contains the index 2, and `c` remains 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
