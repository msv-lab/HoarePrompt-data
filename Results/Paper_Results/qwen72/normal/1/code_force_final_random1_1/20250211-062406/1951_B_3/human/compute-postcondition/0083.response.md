Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped, `h` is the value of the first element of `s` (s[0]), `j` is 1, and `i` is `s[2]`. If `h` is less than `i`, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 2.**
