Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is `s[2]`, `j` is increased by 1, if `h` is less than `s[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
