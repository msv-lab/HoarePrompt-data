Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]` where `k` is 14 if the condition `k == 14` is true; `ind` is a list containing the indices of up to 2 elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 2 if there are at least 2 elements in `a` greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and less than 2; `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop, which could be any value from 0 to n-1 depending on when the loop breaks or completes; `n` is the length of the list `a`. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and has more than 1 element, and the first element of `ind` is not 0. Furthermore, `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.***
