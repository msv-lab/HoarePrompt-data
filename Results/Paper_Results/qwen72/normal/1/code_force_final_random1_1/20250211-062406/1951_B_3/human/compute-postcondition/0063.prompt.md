Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the first element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is 0. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is 1, then `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the third element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `z` is 1, and `ans1` remains unchanged. If `i` is greater than `h`, `z` remains unchanged, `ans1` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is 1, then `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
