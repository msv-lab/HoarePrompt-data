Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking).
- `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking).
- `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`.
- `p` is equal to `j`.
- `z` is 1.
- `ans1` is the total number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, plus the number of times `z` was 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(ans, ans1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ans` and `ans1`**:
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`.
   - `ans1` is similar to `ans` but includes an additional count if `z` is 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`.

2. **Determining the Values**:
   - `ans` is a count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`.
   - `ans1` is the same as `ans` plus 1 if `z` is 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`.

3. **Calculating `max(ans, ans1)`**:
   - If `s[0]` is not equal to `h` and `z` is 1, then `ans1` will be `ans + 1`.
   - If `s[0]` is equal to `h` or `z` is not 1, then `ans1` will be equal to `ans`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`.
   - Since `ans1` is either `ans` or `ans + 1`, the output will be `ans + 1` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise it will be `ans`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **max(ans, ans + 1 if s[0] != h and z == 1 else ans) (where ans is the count of elements in s that are equal to h and meet the condition h >= i before encountering an element greater than h)**
