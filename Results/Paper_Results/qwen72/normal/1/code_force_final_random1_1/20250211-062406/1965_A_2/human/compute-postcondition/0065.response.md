The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `lis`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `lis` and the value of `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `len(lis)` must be greater than `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `lis` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3, and `lis` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3, `test` remains True**
