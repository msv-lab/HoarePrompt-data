To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `j` and the length of the list `lis`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- The range `range(1, len(lis))` must contain at least one value. This means `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`
- `test` is True

We need to ensure that `len(lis)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `test`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `lis` to ensure it has more than one element.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True**
