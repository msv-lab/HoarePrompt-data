The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lis`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lis`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `len(lis)` must be greater than `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2, and `lis` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements, `test` is True, `j` is 2**
