Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `1` is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1. If `test` is True, no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially. If `test` is False, `test` indicates that at least one pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.***
