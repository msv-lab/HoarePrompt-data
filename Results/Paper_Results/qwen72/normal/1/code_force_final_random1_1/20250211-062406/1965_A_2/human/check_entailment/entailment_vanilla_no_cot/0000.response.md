Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The code reads the number of piles `n` incorrectly. It should read `n` as an integer, but instead, it reads it as a list of integers, which is incorrect.
   
2. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1` is called with `arr`, but the function itself does not handle the input correctly. Specifically, it assumes that the first element of `arr` is always the smallest, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It checks if the smallest element is 1 and then sorts the unique elements of the array. However, the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of distinct values in the array, not just the difference between consecutive elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    result = func_1(arr)
    print(result)

def func_1(arr):
    # The game is won by the player who can force the other to make the last move.
    # This is determined by the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
    distinct_piles = len(set(arr))
    if distinct_piles % 2 == 1:
        return 'Alice'
    else:
        return 'Bob'
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
- **Input Handling**: The number of piles `n` is read as an integer, and the array `arr` is read as a list of integers.
- **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` determines the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

This corrected solution should work correctly for the given problem.
