To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `set_`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(set_)` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, len(set_))` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(set_)`. If `len(set_)` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `A` is False.
- `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, including 1.
- `not_c` is True.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `len(set_)` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` should start at 1, as specified by the range.

### Final State:
- `arr` remains a list of positive integers.
- `A` remains False.
- `set_` must be a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements (including 1).
- `not_c` remains True.
- `i` is 1.

### State:
**`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, including 1; `not_c` is True; `i` is 1**
