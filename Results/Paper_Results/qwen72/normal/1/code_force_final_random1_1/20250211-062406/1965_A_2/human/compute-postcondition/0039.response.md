Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `1` is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and `test` is set to True. If the length of `lis` is odd, the length of `lis` remains odd. If the length of `lis` is even, the length of `lis` remains even.***
