Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1.
- `j` is even.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Alice'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
