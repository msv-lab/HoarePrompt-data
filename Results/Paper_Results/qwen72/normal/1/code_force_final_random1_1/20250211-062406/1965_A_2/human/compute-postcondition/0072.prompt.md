Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `test` is True. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the program maintains these conditions. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` indicates whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements. If the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
