Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, `test` remains unchanged, indicating whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially. If `1` is in `lis` and `len(lis) > 1`, `test` is True if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is at most 1, and `test` is False otherwise.***
