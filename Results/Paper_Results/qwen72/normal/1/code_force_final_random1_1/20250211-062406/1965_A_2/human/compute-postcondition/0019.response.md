Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, including 1; `i` is 3; `not_c` is False.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `not_c` to `False`. All other variables (`arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping the initial conditions of the other variables intact.
