Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the program maintains these conditions. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` indicates whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially. If `test` is True, all consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference of at most 1. If `test` is False, `test` remains False, indicating that there are at least two consecutive elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1.***
