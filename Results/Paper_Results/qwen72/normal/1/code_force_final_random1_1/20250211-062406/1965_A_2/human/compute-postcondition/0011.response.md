Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, including 1; `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element (`set_[1]`) and the first element (`set_[0]`) of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.***
