Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is a list containing the index `i` (which is 1); `c` is 2; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0.** 

The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
