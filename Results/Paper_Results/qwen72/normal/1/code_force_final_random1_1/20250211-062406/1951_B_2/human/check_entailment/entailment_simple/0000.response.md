### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the owner's cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the maximum number of wins the owner's cow can achieve.
   - It initializes `x` to the rating of the owner's cow (`a[k]`).
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to find indices of elements greater than `x` and stores them in `ind` until it finds up to 2 such elements.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No elements greater than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - The function returns `n - 1`, which is correct because if no other cow has a higher rating, the owner's cow will win all matches.
   - **Case 2: Exactly one element greater than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If the greater element is at index 0, the function returns `k - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct logic should consider the position of the owner's cow and the position of the greater element.
     - If the greater element is after the owner's cow (`ind[0] > k`), the function returns `ind[0] - 1`, which is correct.
     - Otherwise, it returns `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`, which is also correct.
   - **Case 3: Two elements greater than `x` (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first greater element is at index 0, the function returns `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`, which is correct.
     - If the owner's cow is after the second greater element (`k > ind[1]`), the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`, which is correct.
     - Otherwise, it returns `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])`, which is correct.

4. **Special Debugging Statement:**
   - The statement `if (k == 14) : print(ind)` is a debugging statement and does not affect the correctness of the program. It prints the indices of elements greater than `x` when `k` is 14.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the case where `len(ind) == 1` and `ind[0] == 0`. The function incorrectly returns `k - 1` instead of considering the correct logic for this scenario.

### Correctness: **False**
