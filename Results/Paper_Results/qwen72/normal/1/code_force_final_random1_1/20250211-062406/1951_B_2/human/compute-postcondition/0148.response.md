Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is `s[2]`, and `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `s[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `h` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
