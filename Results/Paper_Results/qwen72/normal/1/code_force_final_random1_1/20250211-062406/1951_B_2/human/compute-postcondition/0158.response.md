Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with its first element (`s[0]`) and the element at index `k-1` swapped back to their original positions, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code swaps the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` in the list `s`.
- Since `p` is equal to `j`, and `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), the swap effectively undoes the initial swap that was performed between `s[0]` and `s[k-1]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `j`, `ans`, `ans1`) remain unchanged.
