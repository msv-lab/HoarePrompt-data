Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of matches a specific cow (identified by index `k`) can win in a tournament, where the cow with the higher rating always wins. The program includes a loop to handle multiple test cases and a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum number of wins for the specified cow.

However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `k`**: The variable `k` is adjusted by subtracting 1 (`k -= 1`) to convert it from a 1-based index to a 0-based index, which is correct. However, this adjustment should be done before calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at index `k`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is overly complex and contains several conditions that are not clearly aligned with the problem statement.
   - The function uses a list `ind` to store indices of elements greater than `x` (the rating of the cow at index `k`). The conditions based on the length of `ind` and the positions of elements in `ind` are not correctly implemented to reflect the problem's requirements.
   - The special case `if k == 14:` is not relevant to the general solution and seems to be a debugging statement.

3. **Return Values**:
   - The return values in `func_1` are not consistent with the expected output. For example, returning `n - 1` when no elements greater than `x` are found is incorrect because it implies the cow can win all matches, which is not necessarily true.
   - The conditions for returning values based on the length of `ind` and the positions of elements in `ind` are not correctly formulated to ensure the maximum number of wins.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
