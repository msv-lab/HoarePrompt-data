Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of matches a specific cow (identified by its index `k`) can win in a series of matches, where the cow with the higher rating always wins. The program allows for a single swap of the cow's position to maximize the number of wins.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ratings `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the maximum number of wins for the cow at index `k`.
   - It initializes `x` to the rating of the cow at index `k`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to find indices of cows with ratings greater than `x` and stores these indices in `ind`.
   - The loop breaks if it finds 2 such indices.

3. **Logic for Determining Maximum Wins:**
   - If no cow has a rating greater than `x`, the function returns `n - 1` (since the cow can win all matches).
   - If only one cow has a rating greater than `x`:
     - If this cow is at index 0, the function returns `k - 1`.
     - If this cow is at an index greater than `k`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - If two cows have ratings greater than `x`:
     - If the first cow is at index 0, the function returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
     - If `k` is greater than the second cow's index, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Hardcoded Condition for `k == 14`:**
  - The condition `if (k == 14):` is hardcoded and prints the `ind` list. This is likely a debugging statement and should not affect the correctness of the solution if removed.
- **General Logic:**
  - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins seems to cover all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement.
  - The conditions and return statements are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The only potential issue is the hardcoded debugging statement, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
