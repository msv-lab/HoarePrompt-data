The value of `x` is assigned the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the conditions for the elements of `a` (each element being unique and within the specified range) still hold true.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`.**
