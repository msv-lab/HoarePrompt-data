Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
