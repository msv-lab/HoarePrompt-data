Output State: **_ is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least `len(s)` elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `h` is the value of the first element of `s` (s[0]), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), and `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking).**
