Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least `len(s)` elements, the first element of `s` (`s[0]`) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (`s[k-1]`) are swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `h` is the value of the first element of `s` (`s[0]`), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `z` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1 and `z` remains 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is not 1, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `z` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1 and `z` remains 1. If `i` is less than `h` and `z` is not 1, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
