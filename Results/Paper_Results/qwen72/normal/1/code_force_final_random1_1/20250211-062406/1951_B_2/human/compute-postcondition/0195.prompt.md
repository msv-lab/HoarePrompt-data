Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and all a_i's are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed. If any element in `s` equals `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is the count of such occurrences. If any element in `s` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks and `z` remains 1. If no element in `s` is greater than `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` after the first occurrence of `h`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a list of integers with at least `len(s)` elements. The value of `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking). The value of `z` is 1 if any element in `s` was equal to `h` and the condition `z == 1` was met; otherwise, it remains 0. The value of `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `z == 1` before encountering an element greater than `h`. The value of `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking). The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, and `h` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `z` is 1, and `ans1` is the total number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, plus the number of times `z` was 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
