Postcondition: ***`i` is the first element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop plus `y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sx` remains the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop.***
