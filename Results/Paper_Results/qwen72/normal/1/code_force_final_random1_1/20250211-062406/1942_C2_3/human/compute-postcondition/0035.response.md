Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after processing all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` according to the loop logic, and `tmp` is a list containing the values `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all pairs where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2 - 1` were true, and `y` is the final value after subtracting the appropriate amounts for each such pair. Additionally, the sum of the first element and the difference between `n` and the last element of `a` is not equal to 2, and the condition `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` is true.**
