Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `gap // 2` from its current value.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, `ans`) remain unchanged or retain their previously defined relationships.
