Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
- `i` is `x - 1`, so `a[i]` is `a[x-1]`.
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- Therefore, `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[x-1] - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
