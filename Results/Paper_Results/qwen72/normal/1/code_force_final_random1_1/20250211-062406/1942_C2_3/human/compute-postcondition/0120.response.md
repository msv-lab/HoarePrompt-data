The code snippet appends the value \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) // 2\) to the list `tmp`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Expression Calculation**:
   - \(a[0]\) is the first element of the sorted list `a`.
   - \(a[\text{len}(a) - 1]\) is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - The expression \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) // 2\) calculates the integer division of the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negation of the last element of `a`.

2. **Appending to `tmp`**:
   - The result of the expression is appended to the list `tmp`.

3. **Variables Affected**:
   - `tmp` is updated by appending the new value.

4. **Variables Unchanged**:
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list of integers with the new value \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) // 2\) appended, and `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop's operations. Additionally, the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of `y` is greater than \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1\), and the expression \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) % 2\) evaluates to 0.**
