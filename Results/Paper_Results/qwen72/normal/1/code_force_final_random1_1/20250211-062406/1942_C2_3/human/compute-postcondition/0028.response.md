Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` now contains one or two elements, the first element being `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition `(a[1] - a[0]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` is met, and the second element being `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1` from its current value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
