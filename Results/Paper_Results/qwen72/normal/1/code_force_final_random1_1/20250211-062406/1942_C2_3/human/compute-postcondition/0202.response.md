Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the sum of all elements in `even`, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division) plus the sum of half of each element in `even` (integer division).**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `even` list.
- For each iteration, the `ans` variable is increased by the current `gap` value from the `even` list.
- The `y` variable is decreased by the integer division of the current `gap` value by 2.
- The loop continues until it has processed all elements in the `even` list or until `y` becomes less than the integer division of the current `gap` by 2, at which point it breaks out of the loop.
- After all iterations, the `ans` variable will have been increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` (as per the initial state) plus the sum of all elements in `even`.
- The `y` variable will have been decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (as per the initial state) plus the sum of half of each element in `even`.
