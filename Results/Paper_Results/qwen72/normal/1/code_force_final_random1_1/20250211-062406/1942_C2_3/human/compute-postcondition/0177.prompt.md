Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` includes the value of `gap` and is now sorted in ascending order. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` includes `gap` and is now sorted in ascending order. If `gap` is less than or equal to 1, or if `gap` is odd but not greater than 1, `gap` is not included in either `odd` or `even`. The lists `odd` and `even` contain the respective gaps calculated during the loop execution.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is an element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order. If `y` was less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is now 0, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
