Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap` if `y >= gap // 2` before the subtraction, otherwise `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2) + gap` before the subtraction, `ans` is now `ans + 2 * y`, `odd` and `even` remain the same, `y` is `y - gap // 2` if `y >= gap // 2` before the subtraction, otherwise `y` is `0`, `gap` is the next element in `even`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value.
- All other variables (`i`, `t1`, `t2`, `odd`, `even`, `gap`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `y` and the calculation of `ans` before the addition of `2 * y` remain as specified in the initial state.
