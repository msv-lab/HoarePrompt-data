Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set of inputs consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x) and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing vertices Bessie has chosen. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**

Note: Since the function signature does not explicitly list the parameters, it is inferred that the function is designed to read input in a specific format, typically from standard input or a predefined source, and process multiple test cases accordingly.
