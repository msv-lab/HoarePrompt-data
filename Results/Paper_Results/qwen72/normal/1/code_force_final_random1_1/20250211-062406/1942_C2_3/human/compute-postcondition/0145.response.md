Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop plus `y * 2` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop, and `sx` is now `sx + i + y * 2`, `y` is `y - c`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`i`, `val`, `x`, `c`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `sx` is the original value of `sx` plus `i` plus `y * 2`.
