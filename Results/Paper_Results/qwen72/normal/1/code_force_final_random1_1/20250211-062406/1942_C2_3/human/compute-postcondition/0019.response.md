The code snippet `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the result of the integer division of the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the sorted list `a` by 2 to the list `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- `tt` must be greater than 0
- `ii` is 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements
- `tmp` is an empty list
- `i` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `tmp` now contains one element, which is the result of `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is a list containing one element equal to `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `i` is 1.**
