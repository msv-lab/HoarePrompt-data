The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `y` to it. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is `x - 1`
   - `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`
   - `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`
   - `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap`
   - `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, and is sorted in ascending order
   - `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, and is sorted in ascending order
   - `y` is `y - gap // 2`
   - `gap` is the second element in `even`

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value.

3. **Calculation:**
   - The new value of `ans` is `ans + 2 * y`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `i` remains `x - 1`
   - `t1` remains `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`
   - `t2` remains `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`
   - `ans` is now `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`
   - `odd` remains the same (all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order)
   - `even` remains the same (all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order)
   - `y` remains `y - gap // 2`
   - `gap` remains the second element in `even`

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, and is sorted in ascending order, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, and is sorted in ascending order, `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `gap` is the second element in `even`.**
