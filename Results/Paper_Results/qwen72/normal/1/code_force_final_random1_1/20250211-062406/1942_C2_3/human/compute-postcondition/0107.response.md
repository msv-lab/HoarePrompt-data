Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, and `ans` is initially `x + y - 2`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is updated to contain the single element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If none of these conditions are met, the variables remain unchanged.***
