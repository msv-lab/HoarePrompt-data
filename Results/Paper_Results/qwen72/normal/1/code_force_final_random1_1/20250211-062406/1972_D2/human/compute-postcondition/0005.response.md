The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been called twice. Since the loop iterates over `t`, and it has already run twice, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 but now it has decreased by 1 from its value at the start of the previous iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 (specifically, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2 at the start of the previous iteration to allow for another iteration).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called twice**
