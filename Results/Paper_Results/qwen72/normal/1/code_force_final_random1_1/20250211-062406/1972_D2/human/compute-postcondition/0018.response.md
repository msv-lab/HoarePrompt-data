Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 1, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: The value of `x` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop body.
- **`y`**: The value of `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met. This means `y` will be the smallest integer that causes the loop condition to fail.
- **`cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied. Therefore, `cnt` will be the sum of these increments for all valid pairs `(x, y)`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
