To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Current State:
- `n` must be at least 20
- `m` must be at least 5
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` remains unchanged

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **First Condition: `(x + y) * x <= n`**
   - Substituting the current values: `(4 + 2) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24`
   - The condition becomes: `24 <= n`
   - Since `n` must be at least 20, this condition is already satisfied because 24 is greater than 20.

2. **Second Condition: `(x + y) * y <= m`**
   - Substituting the current values: `(4 + 2) * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12`
   - The condition becomes: `12 <= m`
   - Since `m` must be at least 5, this condition is also satisfied because 12 is greater than 5.

### Conclusion:
Both conditions are already satisfied with the current values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be at least 20, `m` must be at least 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `cnt` remains unchanged**
