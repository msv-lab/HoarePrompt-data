The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 3, so the new value of `y` is 4. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 3) and the new `y` (which is 4) is still 1. Since the GCD of `x` and `y` remains 1, `cnt` is updated to 2.25 + min(n / 18, m // 18). The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged and must still be at least 18.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 4, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1, `cnt` is 2.25 + min(n / 18, m // 18)**
