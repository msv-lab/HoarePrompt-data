To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 20.
- `m` must be at least 5.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:**
   - `x + y = 4 + 1 = 5`
   - `(x + y) * x = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `(x + y) * y = 5 * 1 = 5`

2. **Check conditions:**
   - `(x + y) * x <= n` which is `20 <= n` (true since `n` is at least 20).
   - `(x + y) * y <= m` which is `5 <= m` (true since `m` is at least 5).

3. **Calculate `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`:**
   - `n / ((x + y) * x) = n / 20`
   - `m // ((x + y) * y) = m // 5`

4. **Determine the minimum value:**
   - `min(n / 20, m // 5)`

5. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt += min(n / 20, m // 5)`

### Final Calculation:
- Since `n` is at least 20 and `m` is at least 5:
  - `n / 20` is at least `20 / 20 = 1`
  - `m // 5` is at least `5 // 5 = 1`
- Therefore, `min(n / 20, m // 5)` is 1.

### Updated State:
- `cnt` is incremented by 1.

### Output State:
- `n` must be at least 20.
- `m` must be at least 5.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the original value of `cnt` plus 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 20, `m` must be at least 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the original value of `cnt` plus 1.**
