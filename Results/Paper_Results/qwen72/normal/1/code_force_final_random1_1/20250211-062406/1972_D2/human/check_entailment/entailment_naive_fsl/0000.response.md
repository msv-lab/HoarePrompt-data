Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will contain multiple test cases, and the first line will contain the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` is called directly without considering the number of test cases. This means that the program will only process the first test case and will not handle the remaining test cases as required.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the input for each test case. The `func_1` function reads the input inside the loop, but it should read the input for each test case within the loop in `func_2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(n, m):
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_1(n, m))

func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program processes all test cases and reads the input correctly for each test case.
