To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the current state:
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` must be at least 10
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 2.25
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - Therefore, `18 <= n` must be true for the first condition to hold.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - Therefore, `18 <= m` must be true for the second condition to hold.

Since `n` must be at least 15 and `m` must be at least 10, these values are not sufficient to satisfy the conditions `18 <= n` and `18 <= m`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` and `m` to ensure they are at least 18.

State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 2.25, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1**
