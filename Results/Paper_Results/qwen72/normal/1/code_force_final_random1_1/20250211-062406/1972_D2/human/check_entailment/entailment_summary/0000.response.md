### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to find pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and both \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - For each valid pair, it increments the count `cnt`.
     - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads an integer \(t\) from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then calls `func_1` \(t\) times, effectively running the logic for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: Both functions handle the input correctly. `func_2` reads the number of test cases, and `func_1` reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - **Logic for Valid Pairs**:
     - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
     - The conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) ensure that the pairs \((x, y)\) are within the bounds.
     - The function correctly counts the number of valid pairs and prints the result.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\) correctly, as shown in the example where the output is 0 for \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases and prints the correct number of valid pairs for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
