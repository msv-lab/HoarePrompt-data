Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions for multiple test cases. Let's break down the correctness of each function:

### Function 1 (`func_1`):

- **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the user input, which are within the specified range \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \).
- **Loop Structure**:
  - The outer loop iterates over \( x \) such that \( x \times x \leq n \). This ensures that \( x \) is a reasonable candidate for the gcd condition.
  - The inner loop iterates over \( y \) such that \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \). This ensures that the pairs \((x, y)\) are within the bounds.
- **GCD Condition**: The function checks if \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). If true, it counts the number of valid pairs using the formula \( \min(n / ((x + y) \times x), m // ((x + y) \times y)) \). This correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a = k \times x \) and \( b = k \times y \) for some integer \( k \).
- **Output**: The function prints the count of valid pairs.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):

- **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer \( t \) from the user input, which represents the number of test cases, and ensures \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- **Test Case Execution**: The function calls `func_1` exactly \( t \) times, processing each test case independently.

### Overall Program Correctness:

- **Input Constraints**: Both functions handle the input constraints correctly.
- **Logic and Conditions**: The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described.

Correctness: **True**
