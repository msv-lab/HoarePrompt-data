Functionality: ** The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It calculates and prints the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` such that `1 <= x, y`, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. After the function concludes, the program state includes the original values of `n` and `m`, and the printed count of valid `(x, y)` pairs. **
