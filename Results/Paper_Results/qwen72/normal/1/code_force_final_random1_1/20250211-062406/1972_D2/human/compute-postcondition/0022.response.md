To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `x = 3`
   - `y = 1`
   - Therefore, `(x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`
   - And, `(x + y) * y = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4`

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     - `(x + y) * x <= n` which simplifies to `12 <= n`
     - `(x + y) * y <= m` which simplifies to `4 <= m`

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute at least once, both `n` and `m` must satisfy their respective conditions:
  - `n` must be at least 12.
  - `m` must be at least 4.

### Final State:
Since `n` and `m` are provided by the user and must be positive integers, we need to ensure they meet the minimum requirements for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 12 and `m` must be at least 4**.
