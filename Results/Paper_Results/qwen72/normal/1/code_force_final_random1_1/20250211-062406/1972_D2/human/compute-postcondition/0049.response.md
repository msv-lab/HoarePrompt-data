To solve this, let's break down the given code:

- The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` calculates the minimum of two values:
  - `n / ((x + y) * x)` which is `n / (4 + 3) * 4` = `n / 7 * 4` = `n / 28`
  - `m // ((x + y) * y)` which is `m // (4 + 3) * 3` = `m // 7 * 3` = `m // 21`

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 28
- `m` must be at least 21
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` remains unchanged

Let's calculate the values:
- For `n / 28`: Since `n` is at least 28, the smallest value of `n / 28` is 1.
- For `m // 21`: Since `m` is at least 21, the smallest value of `m // 21` is 1.

The `min` function will return 1 because both expressions evaluate to at least 1.

Therefore, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 28, `m` must be at least 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
