Output State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 2.25 + min(n / 18, m // 18), and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the minimum of two expressions: `n / 18` and `m // 18`.
- The value of `x` is 3, and the value of `y` is 3, so `(x + y) * x` is `18` and `(x + y) * y` is also `18`.
- The first expression `n / 18` is a floating-point division, and the second expression `m // 18` is an integer division.
- Since `n` and `m` are both at least 18, the minimum of these two values will be added to `cnt`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and the greatest common divisor condition remain unchanged.
