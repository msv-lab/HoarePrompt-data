Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 20, `m` must be at least 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. Additionally, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1.**
