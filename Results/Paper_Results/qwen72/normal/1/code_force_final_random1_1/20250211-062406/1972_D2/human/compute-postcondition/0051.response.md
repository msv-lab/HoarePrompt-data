The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `math.gcd(x, y)` (which is `math.gcd(4, 4)`) is not equal to 1, `cnt` does not change.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 28, `m` must be at least 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
