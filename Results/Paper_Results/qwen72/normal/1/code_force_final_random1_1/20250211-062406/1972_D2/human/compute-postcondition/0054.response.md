Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain unchanged as they are input parameters and are not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: The loop continues until `x * x > n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- **`y`**: Inside the inner loop, `y` is reset to 1 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. Since the loop ends when `x * x > n`, the final value of `y` will be 1.
- **`cnt`**: This variable accumulates the count of valid `(x, y)` pairs that satisfy the conditions `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The final value of `cnt` will be the total count of such pairs found during all iterations of the loop.
