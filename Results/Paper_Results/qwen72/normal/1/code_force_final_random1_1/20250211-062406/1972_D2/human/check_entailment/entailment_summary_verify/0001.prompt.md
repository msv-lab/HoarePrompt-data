You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `func_1` has been executed `t` times, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
     - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
     - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1.
     - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
     - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input handling is correct. It reads the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - **Condition Checking**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly checked by ensuring \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and then counting the valid pairs.
   - **Efficiency**: The algorithm uses a nested loop with a complexity of \(O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{m})\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - **Output**: The output is correctly printed for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.
