The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m`: Integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.
  - `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i.
  - `b`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i.

The function processes each test case and returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is impossible for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `m`, the function should return -1.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with the number of people in the queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), the cost to bribe each person (`a`), and the cost to bribe each person between positions (`b`). It returns the minimum total cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is impossible, it returns -1.**
