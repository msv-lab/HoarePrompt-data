Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, all other variables (`b_values`, `y`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `x`, `custos`, `nf`, `a_values`) remain unchanged, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `y` is the first element in `a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer value of the first element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `y` is the second element in `a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer value of the first element in `a` and the integer value of the second element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `y` is the third element in `a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer value of the first element in `a`, the integer value of the second element in `a`, and the integer value of the third element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
