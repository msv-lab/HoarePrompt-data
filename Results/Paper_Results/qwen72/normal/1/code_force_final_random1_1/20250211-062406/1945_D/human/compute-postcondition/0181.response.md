To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `y`, `max_p`, and the range parameters. The loop will execute if `max_p - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and the step `-1` ensures that `y` decreases with each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `y` should start at `max_p - 1`.

Let's break it down:

1. **`y`**: This variable will start at `max_p - 1`.
2. **`max_p`**: This variable must be greater than 1 to ensure that `max_p - 1` is at least 0, allowing the loop to execute at least once.

All other variables mentioned in the initial state (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be greater than 1, `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, `custos` will include the final value of `custo`, `y` will be `max_p - 1` (or less, depending on the number of iterations), all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) will remain unchanged as described in the initial state.**
