You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be adjusted to their respective indices (decremented by 1), and the variable `total` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0. The variable `best` will hold the minimum value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`. The variable `v` will be -1, indicating the loop has completed its iterations. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, followed by two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to `pos_final` using the costs provided in the lists. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Adjusting Indices**: The function adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each to convert them to zero-based indices, which is appropriate for Python lists.
3. **Initialization**: The function initializes `total` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost, and `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost found.
4. **Loop Through People**: The function iterates through the people in reverse order (from the last person to the first). This is necessary because Kirill starts at the end of the line and can only move forward.
5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the desired final position `pos_final`, the function checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - The function then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This ensures that Kirill pays the least amount to either swap or pass through the person at position `v`.
6. **Outside Desired Position**: If the current position `v` is outside the desired final position, the function simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
7. **Output**: After processing all positions, the function prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Correctness:
The logic of the function appears to correctly implement the problem requirements. It iterates through the people in reverse order, calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the desired range, and keeps track of the best cost found. The function handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
