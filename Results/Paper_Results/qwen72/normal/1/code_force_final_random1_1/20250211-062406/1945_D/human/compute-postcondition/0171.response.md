Postcondition: ***`custos` includes the current value of `custo`, which is either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, and `a_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `a`.***
