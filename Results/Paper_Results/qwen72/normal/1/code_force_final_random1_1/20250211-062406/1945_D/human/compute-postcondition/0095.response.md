To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `pos_final` is decreased by the number of iterations.
   - `total` is the cumulative sum of the smaller costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration.
   - `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - `v` is 0.
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `pos_final`: This variable is initially set to some value and is decreased by the number of iterations. The exact initial value and the number of iterations are not provided, but we know it is being decremented.
   - `total`: This variable accumulates the smaller costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration.
   - `best`: This variable starts with an initial value and is updated to the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

3. **Logic of the Print Statement**:
   - The `print(best)` statement will output the final value of `best` after all iterations have been completed.

4. **Final Value of `best`**:
   - Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and the initial `best` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `best`.
   - However, based on the given information, `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration.

Given this information, the output of the `print(best)` statement will be the final value of `best` after all iterations, which is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value between the initial best and the sum of total and custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for each iteration where v is less than or equal to pos_final)**
