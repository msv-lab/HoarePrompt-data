The only objects in the loop head are `y` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 1 string, and `y` is the first string in `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least 2 strings, and `y` will be the second string in `b`.

State: **`custos` still includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` now includes the integer value of the first string in `b`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 2 strings, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `a`, `y` is the second string in `b`.**
