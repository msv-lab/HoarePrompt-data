### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is essential for handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Adjusting Indices**: The function adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each to convert them to zero-based indices. This is appropriate for Python lists and aligns with the problem's requirement.

3. **Initialization**: The function initializes `total` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost, and `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost found. This initialization is correct and ensures that `best` starts with a high value that can be updated.

4. **Loop Through People**: The function iterates through the people in reverse order (from the last person to the first). This is necessary because Kirill starts at the end of the line and can only move forward. The loop correctly processes each person in the queue.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the desired final position `pos_final`, the function checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - The function then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This ensures that Kirill pays the least amount to either swap or pass through the person at position `v`.
   - If the current position `v` is outside the desired final position, the function simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

6. **Output**: After processing all positions, the function prints the minimum cost stored in `best`. This is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
The logic of the function appears to correctly implement the problem requirements. It iterates through the people in reverse order, calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the desired range, and keeps track of the best cost found. The function handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final: **True**
