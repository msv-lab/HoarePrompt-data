The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This means that `custo_pra_trocar_a` now holds a list of integers, each representing the cost to change an element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers read from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
