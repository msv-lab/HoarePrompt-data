The only object in the loop head is the list `custos`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `custos` list. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the `custos` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must have at least three elements.

State: **`custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least three elements**
