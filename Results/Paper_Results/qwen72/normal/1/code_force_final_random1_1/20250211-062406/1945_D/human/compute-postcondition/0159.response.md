To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `y` and the list `b`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.

For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one element. The variable `y` will take the value of the first element in `b` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `b` is not empty and `y` is set to the first element of `b`.

State: **`custos` still includes the current value of `custo` which is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` remains an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces and must have at least 1 string, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `a`, `y` is the first string in `b`**
