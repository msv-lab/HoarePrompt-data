To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over a range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.
- For the loop to execute, the starting value (`num_fila - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the ending value (`max_p - 1`), because the step is `-1` (decrementing).

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `y`: This is the loop variable and will be adjusted internally by the loop.
- `num_fila`: This must be an integer.
- `max_p`: This must be an integer.

### Conditions for Execution:
- The loop will execute if `num_fila - 1 >= max_p - 1`.
- Simplifying this condition: `num_fila >= max_p`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.

### Final State:
- `custos` still includes the current value of `custo` which is 0.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`.
- `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`.
- `b_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `b`.
- `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
- `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged.
- `a_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `a`.
