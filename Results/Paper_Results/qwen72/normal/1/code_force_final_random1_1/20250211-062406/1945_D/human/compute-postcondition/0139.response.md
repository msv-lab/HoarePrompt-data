Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `na_frente` must be at least 1, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The value of `best` is not modified by this code snippet.
