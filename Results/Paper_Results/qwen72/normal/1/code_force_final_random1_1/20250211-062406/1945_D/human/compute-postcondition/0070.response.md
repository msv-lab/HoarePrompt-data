Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, `best` is 1000000000000, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
