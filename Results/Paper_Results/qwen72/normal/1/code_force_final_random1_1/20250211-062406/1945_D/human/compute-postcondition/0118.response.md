Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.** 

The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
