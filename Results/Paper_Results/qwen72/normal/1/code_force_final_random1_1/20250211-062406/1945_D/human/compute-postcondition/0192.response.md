The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` relative to the lower bound of the range, which is 0. The loop decrements `y` by 1 each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 1` or less, and `max_p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, making it `max_p - 2` or less, but still greater than 0.

State: **`y` is `max_p - 2` or less, `max_p` is greater than 1, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, and if `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[max_p - 2] + b_values[max_p - 1]` is greater than `a_values[max_p - 1]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`. `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.**
