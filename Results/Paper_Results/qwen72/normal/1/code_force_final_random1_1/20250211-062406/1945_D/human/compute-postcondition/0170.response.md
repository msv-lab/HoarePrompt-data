Output State: **`custos` still includes the current value of `custo` which is `b_values[y]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `a`. Additionally, `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`.**
