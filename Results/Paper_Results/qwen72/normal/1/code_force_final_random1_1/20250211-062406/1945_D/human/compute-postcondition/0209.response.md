Output State: **`custos` now includes the final value of `custo`, and all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.** 

Explanation: The code appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`. This means that `custos` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `custo` after the loop has completed. All other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
