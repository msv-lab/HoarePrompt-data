Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change `a` at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
