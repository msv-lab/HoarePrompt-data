To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `t-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `t` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
