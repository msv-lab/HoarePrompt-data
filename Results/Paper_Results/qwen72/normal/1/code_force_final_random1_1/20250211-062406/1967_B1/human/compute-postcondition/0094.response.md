Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `m` are the last input integers provided, `t` remains the same as the initial input, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the final value calculated by the loop, which is the sum of `n` and the results of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop for each pair of `n` and `m` inputs. For each pair, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the last input integers provided during the last iteration of the outer loop.
- **`t`**: This remains unchanged from the initial input, as it controls the number of iterations of the outer loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- **`count`**: For each pair of `n` and `m`, `count` will be `m + 1` after the inner loop completes.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` for each pair of `n` and `m` is calculated by the inner loop, which iterates from `2` to `m` and updates `ans` based on the given formula. The final `ans` for each pair is printed.
- **`countmins` and `g`**: These are intermediate variables used within the inner loop. `countmins` is always `m - 1`, and `g` is calculated as `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the inner loop breaks early.
