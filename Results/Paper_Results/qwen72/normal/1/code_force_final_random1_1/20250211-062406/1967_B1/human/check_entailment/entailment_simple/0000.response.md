### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates `countmins` as \(b - 1\) and `g` as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor - (b - 1)\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{g}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The initialization of `ans` to \(n\) is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) will satisfy the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\).
   - The loop correctly iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - The calculation of `countmins` and `g` is intended to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic for updating `ans` seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the expression \(\left\lfloor \frac{g}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\) does not directly correspond to the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.

5. **Flaw in the Algorithm**:
   - The key issue is in the update step: `ans += int(g / count) + 1`.
   - This step does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each \(b\). The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
