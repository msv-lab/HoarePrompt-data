You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` and `m` are the last input integers provided, `t` remains the same as the initial input, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the final value calculated by the loop, which is the sum of `n` and the results of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop for each pair of `n` and `m` inputs. For each pair, `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and incrementing it based on a loop that runs from 2 to `m`. The loop modifies `ans` by adding a computed value derived from `n` and the current loop index. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `ans` for each test case. The state after the function concludes includes `t` remaining unchanged, `n` and `m` being the last input values for the final test case, and `ans` being the final calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
2 2
```
According to the problem, the valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). Therefore, the expected output should be 3.

However, the program outputs 4, which is incorrect. This discrepancy arises because the logic in the program does not correctly account for all valid pairs in this case. Specifically, the loop and the way `ans` is incremented do not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.
