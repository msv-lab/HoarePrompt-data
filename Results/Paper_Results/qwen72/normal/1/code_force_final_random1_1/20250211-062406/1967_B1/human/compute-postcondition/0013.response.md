Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
