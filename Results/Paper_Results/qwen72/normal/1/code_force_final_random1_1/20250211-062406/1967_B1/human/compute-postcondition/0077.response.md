Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `int(count - 1)`, which evaluates to `int(3 - 1)` resulting in `2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
