The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and incrementing it based on a loop that runs from 2 to `m`. The loop modifies `ans` by adding a computed value derived from `n` and the current loop index. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `ans` for each test case. The state after the function concludes includes `t` remaining unchanged, `n` and `m` being the last input values for the final test case, and `ans` being the final calculated value for each test case.
