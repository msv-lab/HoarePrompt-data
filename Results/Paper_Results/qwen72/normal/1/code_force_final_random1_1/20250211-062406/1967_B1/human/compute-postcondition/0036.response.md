To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `count <= m`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is the first input integer,
- `m` is the second input integer,
- `t` must be greater than 1,
- `i` is 1,
- `count` is 2,
- `ans` is `n`,
- `countmins` is `m`,
- `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.

The loop condition is `count <= m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Currently, `count` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Since `m` is the second input integer, it is already given as an integer. To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `ans`, `countmins`, `g`) do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**
