The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within a certain range, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be updated to the new values provided by the input, while the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
