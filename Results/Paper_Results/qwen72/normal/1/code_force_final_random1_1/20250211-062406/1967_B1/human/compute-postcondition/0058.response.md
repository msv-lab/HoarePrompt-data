Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / 5) - 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from its current value. Initially, `g` is `int(n / 5)`, and `countmins` is 4. Therefore, `g` becomes `int(n / 5) - 4`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that if `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, remains valid.
