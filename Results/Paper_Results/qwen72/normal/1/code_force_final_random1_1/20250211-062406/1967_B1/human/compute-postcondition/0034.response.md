Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is the final value calculated by the loop, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `m - 1`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.**
