Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / count)` (which is `int(n / 5)`). If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next part of the code.***
