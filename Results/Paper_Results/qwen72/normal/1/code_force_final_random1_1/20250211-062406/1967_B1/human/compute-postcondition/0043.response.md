Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `ans` was initially set to `n`.
- `g` is calculated as `int(n / 2) - 1`.
- The code snippet updates `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to it.
- Since `count` is 2, the expression `int(g / count)` simplifies to `int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2)`.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged.
