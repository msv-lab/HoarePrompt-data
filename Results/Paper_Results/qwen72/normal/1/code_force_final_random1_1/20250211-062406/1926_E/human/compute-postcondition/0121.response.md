Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\). If `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), then `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left( \left( \frac{n + 1}{2^j} + 1 \right) // 2 \right)\), `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\). Otherwise, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, and `g` is 0.***
