Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is \(-(n + 1)\), `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing \((n + 1) // 2\), \((n + 1) // 2\), and \((n + 1) // 2\), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\).
- The list `L` initially contains two elements, both equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- After executing `L.append(m)`, the list `L` now contains three elements, all equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.
