Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left( \left( \frac{n + 1}{2^j} + 1 \right) // 2 \right)\), and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `s` remains `k` as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, and it remains unchanged after the loop completes.
- The variable `d` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `h` is reduced by \((h + 1) // 2\) in each iteration. After `i` iterations, `h` becomes 0.
- The variable `p` increments by 1 in each iteration, so after `i` iterations, `p` is equal to `i`.
- The variable `g` accumulates the value of \((h + 1) // 2\) in each iteration. After `i` iterations, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left( \left( \frac{n + 1}{2^j} + 1 \right) // 2 \right)\).
- The condition that `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\) remains true throughout the loop.
