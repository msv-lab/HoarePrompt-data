Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is `k`, `i` must be at least 3, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 3, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + ((n + 1) // 4 + 1) // 2 + ((n + 1) // 4 - ((n + 1) // 4 + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).**

Explanation: The value of `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
