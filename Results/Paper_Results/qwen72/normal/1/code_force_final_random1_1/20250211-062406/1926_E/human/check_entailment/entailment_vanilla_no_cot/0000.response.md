Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes the input to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules. The program iterates through the possible groups of cards (odd numbers, twice odd numbers, etc.), calculates the size of each group, and keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down. When it finds the group that includes the k-th card, it calculates and prints the correct card number. The solution efficiently handles the constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples.
