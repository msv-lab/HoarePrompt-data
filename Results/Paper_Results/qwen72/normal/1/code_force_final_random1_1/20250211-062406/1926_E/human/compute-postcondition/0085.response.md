The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\), the new value of `n` will be:

\[ n - (n + 1) // 2 \]

Since `n` is \(-(n + 1) // 2\) and must be non-zero, let's simplify the expression:

\[ n - (n + 1) // 2 = -(n + 1) // 2 - (n + 1) // 2 = -((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2) = -((n + 1)) \]

Therefore, the new value of `n` is \(-(n + 1)\).

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is \(-(n + 1)\), `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing \((n + 1) // 2\) and \((n + 1) // 2\), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**
