To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing at least one element.
- `tot` is 0.
- `pow` is 1.
- `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0.
- The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `pow`:**
   - According to the initial state, `pow` is 1.

2. **Value of `k - tot`:**
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `tot` is 0 (from the initial state).
   - Therefore, `k - tot` simplifies to `k - 0`, which is just `k`.

3. **Expression Inside the Parentheses:**
   - The expression inside the parentheses is `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.
   - Substituting `k - tot` with `k`, we get `2 * k - 1`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substituting the values, this becomes `1 * (2 * k - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
