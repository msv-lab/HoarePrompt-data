Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which means `m` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
