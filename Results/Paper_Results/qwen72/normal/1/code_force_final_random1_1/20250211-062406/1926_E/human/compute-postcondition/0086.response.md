The code snippet `L.append(m)` adds the value of `m` to the end of the list `L`. Given that `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `L` initially contains two elements, both equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), after appending `m`, `L` will contain three elements, all equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is \(-(n + 1)\), `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing \((n + 1) // 2\), \((n + 1) // 2\), and \((n + 1) // 2\), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
