Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers where each element is `(n + 1) // 2` from each iteration, and the sum of the elements in `L` equals the initial value of `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero.
- In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is then updated to `n - m`.
- The value of `m` is appended to the list `L` in each iteration.
- The loop will terminate when `n` becomes 0.
- After the loop finishes, `n` will be 0, and `L` will contain a sequence of integers where each integer is the result of `(n + 1) // 2` from each iteration.
- The sum of the elements in `L` will equal the initial value of `n` because each `m` is subtracted from `n` in each iteration until `n` reaches 0.
