Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2` before the update, `tot` is the sum of all elements in the original `L` (which was 0), `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of original } L}\) (which was 1), `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\) before the update.**
