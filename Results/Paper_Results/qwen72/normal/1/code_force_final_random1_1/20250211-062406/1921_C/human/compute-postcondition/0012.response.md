Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` is either empty or contains one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` if the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of `arr` is less than `b / a`.***
