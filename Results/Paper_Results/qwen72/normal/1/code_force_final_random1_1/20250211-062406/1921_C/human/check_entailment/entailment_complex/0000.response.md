Reasoning:  
The function `func` aims to determine if Stepan can send all messages without his phone's battery running out. It processes multiple test cases, reading the necessary parameters for each case and calculating the feasibility of sending all messages based on the initial charge, charge consumption rates, and the moments when messages need to be sent.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Charge Consumption**:
   - The function calculates the charge consumption for intervals where the phone is on continuously (`(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`). However, it only considers these intervals if they are shorter than the time it takes to turn the phone off and on (`b / a`). This approach might miss some critical intervals where turning the phone off and on would be more efficient.
   - The function should consider the total charge consumption for all intervals, including the cost of turning the phone off and on, to ensure the phone has enough charge to send all messages.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Printing 'Yes'/'No'**:
   - The condition `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:` is incorrect. It assumes that the phone will turn off and on for every interval not included in `array2`, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the total charge consumption for all intervals, considering both continuous usage and the cost of turning the phone off and on, and compare it to the initial charge `f`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases well, such as when the initial charge `f` is very large or when the number of messages `n` is small.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
