t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of messages, f is the initial charge of the phone, a is the charge consumption per unit of time, and b is the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9, m_i < m_{i+1}), representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
