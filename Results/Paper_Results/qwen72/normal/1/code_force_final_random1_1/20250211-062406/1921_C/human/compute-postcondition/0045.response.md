Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` must be greater than `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
  - `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0.
  - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
  - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
  - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from a new input.
- `array2` is a list containing the results of \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) \times a\) for all \(j\) in the range \([1, n-1]\) where the condition \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < \frac{b}{a}\) is true.
- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of \((n - \text{len}(array2))\) and `b` is less than `f`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0.
   - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
   - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
   - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `array2` is constructed based on the condition \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < \frac{b}{a}\).

2. **Condition for `array2`:**
   - For each \(j\) in the range \([1, n-1]\), if \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < \frac{b}{a}\), then \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) \times a\) is added to `array2`.

3. **Final Condition:**
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of \((n - \text{len}(array2))\) and `b` must be less than `f`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute if the final condition is met. Since the problem states that the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of \((n - \text{len}(array2))\) and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is satisfied.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
