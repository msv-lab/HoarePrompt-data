The code snippet reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `feat`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers read from input.**
