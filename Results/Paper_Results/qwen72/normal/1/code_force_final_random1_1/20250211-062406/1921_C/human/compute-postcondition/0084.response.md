Output State: **`array2` is no longer an empty list; it now contains the value `arr[0] * a`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is 0. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`.**
