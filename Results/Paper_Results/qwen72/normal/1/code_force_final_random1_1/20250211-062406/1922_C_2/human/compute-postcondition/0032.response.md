The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to have run at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 4`. However, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-4`, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.**
