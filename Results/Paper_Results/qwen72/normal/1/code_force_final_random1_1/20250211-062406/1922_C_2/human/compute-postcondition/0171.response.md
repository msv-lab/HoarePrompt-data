Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities `n`, their positions on the number line as a list of integers, the number of queries `m`, and a list of query pairs. For each query pair (x_i, y_i), the function returns the distance between the two cities specified by the indices x_i and y_i. The function processes all test cases and returns the results for all queries.**
