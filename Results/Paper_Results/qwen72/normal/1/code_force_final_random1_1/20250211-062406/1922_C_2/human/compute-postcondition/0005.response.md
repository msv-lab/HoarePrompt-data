Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`.** 

The value of `d1[2]` is set to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
