Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`. Additionally, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**
