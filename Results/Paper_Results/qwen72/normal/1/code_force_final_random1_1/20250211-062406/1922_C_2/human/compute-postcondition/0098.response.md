To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
   - `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are a new pair of integers provided by user input, and the current value of `y` is greater than `x`.

2. **Relevant Code:**
   ```python
   print(d1[y] - d1[x])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, which means any key that is not explicitly set will have a default value of 0.
   - We know that `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are provided by user input, and it is given that `y > x`.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is any other value, `d1[x]` will be 0 because no other keys are explicitly set in `d1`.
   - Similarly, if `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is any other value, `d1[y]` will be 0.

5. **Calculation:**
   - If `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `x` is 2 and `y` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If `x` is not 2 and `y` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `x` is not 2 and `y` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

Given that `y > x`, the only scenario where both `x` and `y` could be 2 is not possible. Therefore, the possible outcomes are:
- If `x` is 2 and `y` is not 2, the output will be `-1`.
- If `x` is not 2 and `y` is 2, the output will be `1`.
- If `x` is not 2 and `y` is not 2, the output will be `0`.

Since `y > x`, the most likely scenarios are:
- `x` is not 2 and `y` is 2, resulting in `1`.
- `x` is not 2 and `y` is not 2, resulting in `0`.

However, without specific values for `x` and `y`, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. The most precise description based on the given conditions is:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a defaultdict with default factory int, d1[2] is 1, and y > x)**
