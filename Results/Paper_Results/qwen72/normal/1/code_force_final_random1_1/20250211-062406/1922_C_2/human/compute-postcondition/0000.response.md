To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`.

For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `t` is the number of test cases and the loop is iterating over the input, it is reasonable to assume that the input value should be equal to `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1, and `i` starts from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0**
