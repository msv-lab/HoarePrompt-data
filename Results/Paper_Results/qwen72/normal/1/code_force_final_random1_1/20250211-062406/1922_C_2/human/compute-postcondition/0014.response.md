Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `d1[i + 2]` to be `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
- Given `i` is 2, `d1[4]` is updated to `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.
- The previous values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1[2]`, and `d2` remain unchanged.
- `d1[3]` was previously set based on the condition involving the differences between elements of `l`, and now `d1[4]` is calculated using the updated value of `d1[3]`.
