To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are a new pair of integers provided by the user input.
- If `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1`**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory `int`, meaning any key that is not explicitly set will have a default value of 0.
   - We know that `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
   - The relationship between `x` and `y` is either `y > x` or `y ≤ x`.

3. **Expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`**:
   - `d1[y]` will return the value associated with the key `y` in `d1`. If `y` is not explicitly set, it will default to 0.
   - `d1[x]` will return the value associated with the key `x` in `d1`. If `x` is not explicitly set, it will default to 0.
   - The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will subtract the value of `d1[x]` from the value of `d1[y]`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `y == 2` and `x != 2`**:
  - `d1[y]` will be 1 (since `d1[2]` is 1).
  - `d1[x]` will be 0 (since `x` is not 2 and defaults to 0).
  - The result will be `1 - 0 = 1`.

- **If `y != 2` and `x == 2`**:
  - `d1[y]` will be 0 (since `y` is not 2 and defaults to 0).
  - `d1[x]` will be 1 (since `d1[2]` is 1).
  - The result will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

- **If `y == 2` and `x == 2`**:
  - `d1[y]` will be 1.
  - `d1[x]` will be 1.
  - The result will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

- **If `y != 2` and `x != 2`**:
  - `d1[y]` will be 0.
  - `d1[x]` will be 0.
  - The result will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the possible values of `x` and `y`, the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y` provided by the user input. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the value of d1 at key y and d1[x] is the value of d1 at key x, with d1[2] being 1 and other keys defaulting to 0)**
