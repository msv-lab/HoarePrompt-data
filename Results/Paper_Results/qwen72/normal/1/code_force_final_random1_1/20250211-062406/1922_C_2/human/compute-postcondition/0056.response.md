The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the new value of `i` should still be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the new state of `i` will be 2. The value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input. If the last `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If the last `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true. The value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 2.**
