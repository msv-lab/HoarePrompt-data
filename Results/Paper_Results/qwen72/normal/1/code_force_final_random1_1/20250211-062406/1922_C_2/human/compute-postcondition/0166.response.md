To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `x` and `y` are a new pair of integers provided by user input.
   - `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.
   - If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d1`:**
   - `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n`.
   - The values in `d1` are determined by some loop logic, but the specific logic is not provided. Therefore, we need to assume that `d1` is populated with some values for keys from 2 to `n`.

3. **Understanding `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Given the initial state and the lack of specific details about how `d1` is populated, we can only describe the output in terms of the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the value of d1 at key y and d1[x] is the value of d1 at key x)**

This output describes the result of the subtraction of the value at key `x` from the value at key `y` in the dictionary `d1`.
