Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is 2, `d1[4]` is 3, `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2]` set to 1.
- The code snippet `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` is executed.
- Since `i` is 3, `i + 2` is 5, and `i + 1` is 4.
- The value of `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]`.
- Before this line, `d1[4]` was already set to 2 (as per the initial conditions).
- Therefore, `d1[5]` is set to `1 + 2`, which is 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
