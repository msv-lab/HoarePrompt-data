The code snippet `m = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables or their values. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer.**
