Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`. Additionally, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d1[3]` is calculated as `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
