You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        d1[2] = 1
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        m = int(input())
        for j in range(m):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities positioned on a number line and a series of queries about distances between specific pairs of cities. It calculates and prints the minimum travel distance between the specified cities for each query. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program state with the last processed test case's data in memory, including the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the last query pair.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the cost to move from one city to another can be calculated using precomputed values stored in dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. However, these dictionaries do not correctly capture the minimum cost for all possible scenarios.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following example:
- Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
- Query: `(1, 4)`

According to the problem description, the optimal path from city 1 to city 4 is:
1. Move from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin).
2. Move from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin).
3. Move from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin).

Total cost: 3 coins.

However, the program calculates the cost using the precomputed values in `d1` and `d2`, which may not always reflect the correct minimum cost. For instance, the program might incorrectly compute the cost as the direct distance between the cities, leading to an incorrect result.

### Specific Issue:
The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the closest city is not the next or previous city in the list. For example, if the cities are `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]` and the query is `(1, 4)`, the program might incorrectly use the direct distance between city 1 and city 4, instead of the optimal path through the closest cities.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
