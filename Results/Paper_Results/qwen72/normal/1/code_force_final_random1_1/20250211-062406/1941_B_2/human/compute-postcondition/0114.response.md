Output State: **`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is 0, `a[3]` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `opNum` is 0, `stop` is False, `a[3]` is reduced by 0.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` updates the value of `a[3]` (since `i` is 2) by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is 0, `2 * opNum` is also 0, so `a[3]` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
