Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string. The first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.**
