You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the variable `_` has been incremented up to the value of `t`. For each iteration, the input integer `a` and the list of integers `b` were processed based on the conditions specified in the loop. If the first element of `b` was odd and the second element was not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` was odd and the second-to-last element was not equal to the last element plus 2, the program printed 'NO'. Otherwise, it printed 'YES'. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain as they were provided in the input, but the loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
