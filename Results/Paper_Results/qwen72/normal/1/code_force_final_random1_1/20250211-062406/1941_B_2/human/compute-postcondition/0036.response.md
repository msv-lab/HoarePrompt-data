Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` has been updated to `0`, `a[n-2]` has been updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` has been updated to `a[n-1] - opNum`. If `stop` is set to True, at least one element in `a` became less than 0 during the loop execution, and the loop skips the rest of its body and moves to the next iteration.**
