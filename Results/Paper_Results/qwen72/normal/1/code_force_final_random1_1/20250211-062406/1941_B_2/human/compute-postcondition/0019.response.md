Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`. If `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` or `(b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)`, the same conditions hold true. Otherwise, the same conditions also hold true.**
