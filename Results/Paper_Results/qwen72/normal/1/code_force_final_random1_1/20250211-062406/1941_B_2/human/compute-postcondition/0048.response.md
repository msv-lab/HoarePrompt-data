Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is less than 0.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, or `a`.

Output: **NO**
