Output State: **`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input with `a[0]` now equal to 0, `a[1]` is decreased by 2 times the original value of `a[0]`, `a[2]` is decreased by the original value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `opNum` is the original value of `a[0]`, `stop` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
