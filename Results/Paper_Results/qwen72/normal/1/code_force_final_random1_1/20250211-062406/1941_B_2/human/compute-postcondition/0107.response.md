Based on the initial state provided:

- `numTest` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers where:
  - `a[0]` is now 0.
  - `a[1]` is now 0.
  - `a[2]` is decreased by the original value of `a[0]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `opNum` is 0.
- `a[3]` is decreased by 0 (no change).
- `stop` is False.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
