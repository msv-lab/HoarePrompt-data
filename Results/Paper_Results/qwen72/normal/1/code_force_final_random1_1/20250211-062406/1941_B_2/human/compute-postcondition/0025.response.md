Based on the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `a`, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `numTest` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `opNum` is equal to `a[1]`.
   - `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`.
   - `a[1]` is updated to `-a[1]`.
   - `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - a[1]`.
   - `a[1]` is now `-2 * a[1]`.
   - `a[2]` is now `a[2] - 2 * opNum`.
   - `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - opNum`.
   - `stop` remains False unless `a[1]` becomes less than 0, in which case `stop` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

2. **Transformations:**
   - `opNum = a[1]`
   - `a[0] = a[0] - a[1]`
   - `a[1] = -a[1]`
   - `a[2] = a[2] - a[1]`
   - `a[1] = -2 * a[1]`
   - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 * opNum`
   - `a[3] = a[3] - opNum`

3. **Analysis:**
   - After the first transformation, `opNum` is set to the value of `a[1]`.
   - `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`.
   - `a[1]` is negated, so `a[1]` becomes `-a[1]`.
   - `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - (-a[1])`, which simplifies to `a[2] + a[1]`.
   - `a[1]` is then updated to `-2 * a[1]`, which means it becomes `-2 * (-a[1]) = 2 * a[1]`.
   - `a[2]` is further updated to `a[2] - 2 * opNum`, which simplifies to `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`.
   - `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - opNum`, which simplifies to `a[3] - a[1]`.

4. **Final State:**
   - `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`.
   - `a[1]` is `2 * a[1]`.
   - `a[2]` is `a[2] + a[1] - 2 * a[1] = a[2] - a[1]`.
   - `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1]`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the transformations and the final state of the variables, the print statement will always print 'NO' regardless of the values of `a`.

Output: **NO**
