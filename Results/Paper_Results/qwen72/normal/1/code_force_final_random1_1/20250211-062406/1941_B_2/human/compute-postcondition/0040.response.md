Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `numTest` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each ranging from 0 to 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `i` is set to `n - 3`.
- `opNum` is the value of `a[n-3]`.
- `a[n-3]` has been updated to 0.
- `a[n-2]` has been updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`.
- `a[n-1]` has been updated to `a[n-1] - opNum`.
- If `stop` is set to True, at least one element in `a` became less than 0 during the loop execution, and the loop skips the rest of its body and moves to the next iteration.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0.
- `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'. The state of the variables and the list `a` does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
