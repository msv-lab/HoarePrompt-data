To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

### Initial State:
- The loop iterates over the array `a` from index `0` to `n - 3`.
- During each iteration, the following updates are made:
  - `a[i] -= a[i]`
  - `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[i]`
  - `a[i + 2] -= a[i]`
- The loop terminates if:
  - `i` reaches `n - 3`, or
  - Any `a[i]` becomes less than 0.
- If the loop terminates because any `a[i]` becomes less than 0, the variable `stop` is set to `True`.
- If the loop completes normally without any `a[i]` becoming less than 0, `stop` remains `False`.
- After the loop, either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0, or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0.

### Analysis:
- The `print('NO')` statement is executed after the loop has completed.
- The output of the `print` statement is a fixed string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the array `a` or the variable `stop`.

Output: **NO**
