Reasoning:  
The provided solution checks specific conditions at the boundaries of the array (first and last elements) but does not fully consider the constraints and the nature of the operations described in the problem. The key insight to solve this problem is to recognize that the operation modifies three consecutive elements in a way that the total sum of the array decreases by 4. Therefore, for the array to be reduced to all zeros, the initial sum of the array must be divisible by 4. Additionally, the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements plays a crucial role because the operation affects the parity of the elements in a specific pattern.

The current implementation only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros. It fails to account for the sum of the array and the parity of the elements throughout the array, which are essential for determining the possibility of reducing the array to all zeros.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
