Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the array is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the array is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further changes are made to the input variables. **
