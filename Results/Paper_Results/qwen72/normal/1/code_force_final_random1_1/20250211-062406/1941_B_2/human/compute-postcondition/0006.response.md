Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the execution.
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting an input string.
- The first element of `b` is even or the second element of `b` is equal to the first element plus 2.
- The last element of `b` is even or the second-to-last element of `b` is equal to the last element plus 2.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute and print 'YES'. The conditions described in the initial state ensure that the list `b` meets certain criteria, but they do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
