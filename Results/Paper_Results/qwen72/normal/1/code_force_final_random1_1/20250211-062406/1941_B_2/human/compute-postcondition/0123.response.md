Based on the initial state provided:

- `numTest` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is a list of integers where the first `n-2` elements are set to 0.
- `a[n-1]` and `a[n]` remain unchanged.
- `i` is `n-3`.
- `opNum` is 0.
- If `stop` is True, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0.
- `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the state of the program.

Output: **YES**
