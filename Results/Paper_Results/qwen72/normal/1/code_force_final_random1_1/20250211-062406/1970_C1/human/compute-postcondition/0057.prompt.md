Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and the tree is represented as a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree. `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, where `distance` is the distance from the `start` node. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`. All neighbors of `start` that are reachable and not already in `visited` have been added to `queue` and `visited`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree. `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. The loop has processed all reachable nodes from `start` until either `target` is found or there are no more nodes to process. If `target` is found, the program returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If `target` is not found, `queue` is empty, and the loop terminates without returning a distance.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree. `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and may be empty or contain elements representing unprocessed nodes and their distances from the `start` node. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is the last node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. The loop will continue until either the `queue` is empty or the `current` node equals `target`, at which point the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `current` node is returned.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
