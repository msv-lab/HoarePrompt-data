#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters but is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of multiple lines: the first line contains two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t=1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing an edge between nodes u and v in the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, indicating the starting node for the round.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    lst = defaultdict(list)
    rev = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst[a].append(b)
        
        rev[b].append(a)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop. The variable `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`), and `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`). The loop has executed `x - 1` times, so the lists in `rev` will contain `x - 1` elements each, corresponding to the pairs `(a, b)` read from the input.
    z = int(input())
    tmp = z
    one = True
    while lst[tmp] != []:
        one = not one
        
        tmp = lst[tmp].pop()
        
    #State: `rev` remains a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `True` or `False` depending on the parity of the number of iterations; `lst[z]` and all lists accessed through `lst` during the loop have been emptied; `tmp` is the last element removed from the last non-empty list in `lst`.
    two = True
    tmp = z
    while rev[tmp] != []:
        two = not two
        
        tmp = rev[tmp].pop()
        
    #State: `two` is the opposite of its value before the initial state if the number of iterations is odd, or the same as its value before the initial state if the number of iterations is even; `rev[z]` initially contained enough elements to allow all iterations to complete, and now it is empty; `tmp` is the last value removed from `rev[z]` during the final iteration of the loop.
    print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')
    #This is printed: 'Hermione' if both `two` and `one` are True, otherwise 'Ron' (where `two` is the value after the iterations and `one` is a boolean value)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input a description of a tree with `n` nodes and a starting node `u_1`. It constructs two dictionaries, `lst` and `rev`, representing the adjacency lists of the tree in both directions. The function then determines the parity of the path lengths from the starting node to the leaves of the tree using two separate loops. If both paths have an even number of edges, it prints 'Hermione'; otherwise, it prints 'Ron'. The function does not return any value.
