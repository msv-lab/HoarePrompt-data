Output State: **`rev` remains a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `True` or `False` depending on the parity of the number of iterations; `lst[z]` and all lists accessed through `lst` during the loop have been emptied; `tmp` is the last element removed from the last non-empty list in `lst`; `two` is `True`.**
