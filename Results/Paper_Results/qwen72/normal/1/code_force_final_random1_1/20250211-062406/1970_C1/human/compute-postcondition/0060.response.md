Functionality: ** The function `bfs` performs a breadth-first search in a tree structure to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node. It accepts two parameters: `start` (the starting node) and `target` (the target node), both integers. The function returns the distance (number of edges) between the start and target nodes if the target is found. If the start node is the same as the target node, it returns 0. If the target node is not found in the tree, it returns -1. After the function concludes, the `visited` set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node, and the `queue` is empty. **
