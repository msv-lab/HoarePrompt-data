Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists, `x` is the first integer from the input (which is `n`), `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`), and the rest of the input remains unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- `rev` is initialized as a `defaultdict` of lists, meaning it will automatically create a list when a new key is accessed.
- `x` is assigned the first integer from the input, which is `n`.
- `y` is assigned the second integer from the input, which is `t`.
- The rest of the input (edges and starting node) remains unchanged and is not yet processed.
