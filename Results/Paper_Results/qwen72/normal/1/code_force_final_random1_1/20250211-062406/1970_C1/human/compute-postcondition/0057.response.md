Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `queue` is now empty, indicating that all reachable nodes from `start` have been processed. `visited` contains all the nodes that were reachable from `start`. If `target` was found during the processing, the function would have returned the distance from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop has terminated without returning a distance, and `queue` is empty.**
