Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and is now one element shorter, `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `current` is the node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor.***
