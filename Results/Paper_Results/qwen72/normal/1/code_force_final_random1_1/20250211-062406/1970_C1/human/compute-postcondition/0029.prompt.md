Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop. The variable `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`), and `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`). The loop has executed `x - 1` times, so the lists in `rev` will contain `x - 1` elements each, corresponding to the pairs `(a, b)` read from the input. `z` is an input integer, and `tmp` is equal to `z`. `one` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `False`; `lst[z]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `True`; `lst[z]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`; `lst[tmp]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[tmp]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `False`; `lst[z]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`; `lst[tmp]` has two less elements; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[tmp]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
