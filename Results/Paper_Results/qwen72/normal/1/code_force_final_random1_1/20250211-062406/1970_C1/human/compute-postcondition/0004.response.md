The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists.
- `x` is greater than 1.
- `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- The rest of the input remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the second integer from the input.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists.
- `x` is greater than 1.
- `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `b` is the second integer from the input.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`), `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
