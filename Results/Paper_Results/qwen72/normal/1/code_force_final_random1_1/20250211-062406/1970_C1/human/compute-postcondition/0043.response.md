The function `func` does not take any parameters but reads input from standard input (stdin). The input includes multiple lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t=1`, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next `n-1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v`, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer `u_1`, where `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`, indicating the starting node for the round.

The function processes this input and returns the result based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function reads from standard input a description of a tree with `n` nodes and a starting node `u_1`. It then processes this input and returns a result based on the structure of the tree and the specified starting node.**
