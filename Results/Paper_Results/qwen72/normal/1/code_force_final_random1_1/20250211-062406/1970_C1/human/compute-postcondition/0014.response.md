The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list associated with the key `a` in the dictionary `lst`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` includes `b` as its last element twice, and the list at key `b` includes `a` as its last element three times.
- `x` is greater than 2.
- `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- `a` is the first integer from the new input.
- `b` is the second integer from the new input.

After executing `lst[a].append(b)`, the list at key `a` in `lst` will have `b` appended to it. Since the list at key `a` already contains `b` twice, it will now contain `b` three times.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` includes `b` as its last element three times, and the list at key `b` includes `a` as its last element three times; `x` is greater than 2; `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `a` is the first integer from the new input; `b` is the second integer from the new input.**
