Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` remains a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`.
- The variable `a` remains a non-empty iterable.
- The list `freq` is reset to a list of 7 zeros.
- The variable `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`. Since `freq` is a list of zeros, `missing` will be equal to `m` if `m` is positive, or 0 if `m` is 0 or negative.
- The list `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.
