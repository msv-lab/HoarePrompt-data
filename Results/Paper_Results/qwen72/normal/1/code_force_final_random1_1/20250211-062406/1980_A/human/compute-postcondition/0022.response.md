The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob` and the iterable `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `a` having elements left to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining, and `prob` is the next element of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least one element remaining, and `prob` will be the next element of `a`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining, `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the next element of `a`**.
