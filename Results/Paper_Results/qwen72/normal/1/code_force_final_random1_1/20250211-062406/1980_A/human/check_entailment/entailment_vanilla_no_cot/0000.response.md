Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by calculating the frequency of each difficulty level in the given set of problems, then determines how many additional problems are needed to meet the requirement for the specified number of rounds. The solution efficiently computes the minimum number of new problems required for each test case.
