The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, m)` with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and `m` being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the `missing` value calculated for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` with `t` elements, where each element is the `missing` value calculated for each test case.**
