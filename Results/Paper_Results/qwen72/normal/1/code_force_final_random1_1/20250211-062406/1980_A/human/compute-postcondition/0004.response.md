Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is managed by the `range` function, `n`, `m`, and `a` are the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.** 

Explanation: The code initializes a list `freq` with 7 elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
