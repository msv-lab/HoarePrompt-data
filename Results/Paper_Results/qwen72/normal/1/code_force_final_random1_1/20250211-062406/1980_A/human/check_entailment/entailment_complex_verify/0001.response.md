### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds, and each round requires one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - Vlad has a bank of `n` problems with known difficulties.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.
   - The output should be the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - For each test case:
     - Count the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given string `a`.
     - Determine how many more problems of each difficulty level are needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.
     - Sum the number of additional problems needed for all difficulty levels.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `m`, and `a` from the test case tuple.
   - It initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 zeros (one for each difficulty level).
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each character.
   - It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level using `max(0, m - f)` and sums these values to get the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly counts the frequency of each difficulty level.
   - It correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.
   - The logic for summing the missing problems and appending the result to the `results` list is correct.
   - The annotated code confirms that the state of the program is as expected at key points, ensuring that the frequency counting and missing problem calculation are performed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
