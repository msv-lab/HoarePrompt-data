The only objects in the loop head are the variable `prob` and the iterable `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `prob` was the first element of `a`, and `a` is a non-empty iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least one element remaining, and `prob` will be the next element in `a`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least one element remaining, `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the next element of `a`.**
