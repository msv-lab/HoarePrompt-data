Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.** 

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`.
- `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining (this part remains unchanged).
- `freq` is reset to a list of 7 zeros.
- `missing` is recalculated as the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, which will be `m` since all `f` are 0.
- `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.
- `prob` is the last element of `a` (this part remains unchanged).
