Output State: **_ is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the count of corresponding characters (A to G) in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes, indicating the next test case will be processed.
- `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`.
- `a` is a non-empty iterable but has no elements remaining after the loop completes, meaning all elements have been processed.
- `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the count of corresponding characters (A to G) found in `a`.
- `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, representing how many more of each character are needed to meet the requirement `m`.
- `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, reflecting the result of the current test case.
- `prob` is the last element of `a`, which was the last character processed in the loop.
