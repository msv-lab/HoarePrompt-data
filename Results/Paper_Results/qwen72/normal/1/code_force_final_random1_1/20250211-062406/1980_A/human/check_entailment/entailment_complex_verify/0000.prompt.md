You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It returns a list `results` with `t` elements, where each element represents the number of additional problems required for the corresponding test case. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The program calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given string `a` using a list `freq`.

2. **Missing Problems Calculation**: For each difficulty level, it calculates the number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. This is done using the expression `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. The `max` function ensures that if there are already enough problems (`f >= m`), no additional problems are counted.

3. **Summing Missing Problems**: The total number of missing problems is the sum of the additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the list of test cases and applying the above logic to each one.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program seems to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
