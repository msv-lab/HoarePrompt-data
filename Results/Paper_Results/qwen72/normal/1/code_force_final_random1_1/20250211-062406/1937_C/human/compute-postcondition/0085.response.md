Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
