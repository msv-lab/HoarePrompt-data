Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `i`, `k`, and `best` remain unchanged from their initial state.
