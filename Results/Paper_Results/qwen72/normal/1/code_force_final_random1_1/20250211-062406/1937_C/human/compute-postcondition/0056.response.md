The value of `k` is now assigned the value of `i`, which is 4. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `res` is a new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 4; otherwise, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `res` is a new input string. `k` is 4.**
