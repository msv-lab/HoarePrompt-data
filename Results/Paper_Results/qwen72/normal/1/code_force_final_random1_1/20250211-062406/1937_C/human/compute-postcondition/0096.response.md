Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `res` is a new input string. If `res` is '<', `k` is 4. Otherwise, `k` is 3 if the new `res` is '<', 1 if the new `res` is not '<', or 2 if neither condition is met.***
