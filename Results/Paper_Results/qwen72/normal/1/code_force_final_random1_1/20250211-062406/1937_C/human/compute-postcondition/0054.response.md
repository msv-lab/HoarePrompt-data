Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 4.
- `i` is 4.
- `res` is a new input string.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

Given this information, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

1. The first argument is the string `'?'`.
2. The second argument is the integer `0`.
3. The third argument is the variable `k`. According to the precondition, if `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3. If `res` is not `<`, then `k` remains unchanged. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `k`, we assume it remains unchanged from its default or undefined state. However, since the problem does not provide a default value for `k`, we will consider the case where `res` is `<` and `k` is 3.
4. The fourth argument is the integer `0`.
5. The fifth argument is the variable `i`, which is 4.
6. The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 3 0 4** (assuming `res` is `<` and `k` is 3)
