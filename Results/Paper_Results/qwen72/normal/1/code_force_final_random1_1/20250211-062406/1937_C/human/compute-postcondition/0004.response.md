Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is 1.
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `'?'`: This is a string literal.
- `0`: This is an integer literal.
- `k`: This is the value of the variable `k`, which is 1.
- `0`: This is another integer literal.
- `i`: This is the value of the variable `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:

Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
