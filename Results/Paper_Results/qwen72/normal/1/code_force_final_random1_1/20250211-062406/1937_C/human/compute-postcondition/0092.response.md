The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 1 if `res` is not '<', otherwise `k` is 2.**
