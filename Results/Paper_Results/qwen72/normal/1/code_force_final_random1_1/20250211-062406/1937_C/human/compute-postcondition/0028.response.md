Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `res` is the input string provided by the user.
- If `res` is '<', `best` is set to 1. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**:
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If no such `i` exists, `k` is set to 1.
   - Given that `i` starts at 2 and `n` is greater than 2, `k` will be either 1 or 2 depending on whether `res` was ever '<' for any value of `i`.

2. **`best`**:
   - `best` is set to 1 if `res` is '<'.
   - Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

3. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `res` was '<' at some point:
  - `k` will be the last value of `i` where `res` was '<'.
  - `best` will be 1.
- **Scenario 2**: If `res` was never '<':
  - `k` will be 1.
  - `best` will be 0.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

- If `res` was '<' at some point:
  - `k` will be the last value of `i` where `res` was '<'.
  - `best` will be 1.
  - Output: **? [k] 1 [k] 2**

- If `res` was never '<':
  - `k` will be 1.
  - `best` will be 0.
  - Output: **? 1 0 1 2**

Since the exact value of `k` depends on the input `res`, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where [k] is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists, and [best] is 1 if `res` is '<' and 0 otherwise)**
