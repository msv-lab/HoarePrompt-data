Precondition: **The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a hidden permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} by specifying four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a comparison result between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The goal is to find indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation, and the total number of test cases and the sum of n across all test cases are bounded.**
