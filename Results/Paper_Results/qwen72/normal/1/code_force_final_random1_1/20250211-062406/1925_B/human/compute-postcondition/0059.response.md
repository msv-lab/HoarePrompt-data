Postcondition: ***`x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i` (i.e., `(x - n * i) % i == 0`), then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (1) and `i` (1). Otherwise, the values of `x`, `i`, `n`, `q`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.***
