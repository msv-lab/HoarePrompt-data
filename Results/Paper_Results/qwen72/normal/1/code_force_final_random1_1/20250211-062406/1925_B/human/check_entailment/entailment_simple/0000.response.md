Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of the sub-problems that sum up to `x` when divided into `n` parts. The approach taken by the program involves iterating through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to check if they can be used to form a set of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum to `x`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `x` and `n`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD. This ensures that if no better solution is found, the default answer is 1, which is correct since the GCD of any set of positive integers is at least 1.

3. **Divisor Search**: The program iterates over potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
   - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`).
   - It then checks if it is possible to form `n` sub-problems with a common difference of `i` such that their sum is `x` (`x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`).
   - Similarly, it checks the same conditions for the complementary divisor `x // i`.

4. **Updating the Answer**: If the conditions are met, the program updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

5. **Output**: After processing all potential divisors, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

The logic is sound because:
- The program correctly identifies the divisors of `x`.
- It ensures that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x`.
- It maximizes the GCD by checking both `i` and `x // i`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to handle all edge cases and provides the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
