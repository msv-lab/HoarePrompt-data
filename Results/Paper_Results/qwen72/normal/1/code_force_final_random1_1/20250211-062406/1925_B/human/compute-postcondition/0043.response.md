Postcondition: ***`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` holds true, in which case `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `x // i`.***
