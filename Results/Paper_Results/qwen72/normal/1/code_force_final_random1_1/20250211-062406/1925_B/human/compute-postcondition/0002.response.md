Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8 (new value from input), `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x (new value from input), `ans` is 1.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, while the values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
