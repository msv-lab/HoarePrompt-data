To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer where \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `i` is defined as `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the following conditions:
     - `x % i == 0`
     - `x - n * i >= 0`
     - `(x - n * i) % i == 0`
     - `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`
     - `x // i > 0`
     - `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`

2. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - `x % i == 0`: `i` must be a divisor of `x`.
   - `x - n * i >= 0`: The product of `n` and `i` must not exceed `x`.
   - `(x - n * i) % i == 0`: The remainder of `x - n * i` when divided by `i` must be zero.
   - `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`: The product of `n` and `x // i` must not exceed `x`.
   - `x // i > 0`: The quotient of `x` divided by `i` must be positive.
   - `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`: The remainder of `x - n * (x // i)` when divided by `x // i` must be zero.

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - We need to find the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies all the conditions.
   - Since `i` is defined as `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, it is a value close to the square root of `x`.
   - We need to check both `i` and `x // i` to see which one satisfies all the conditions and is the maximum.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the constraints and the conditions, the value of `ans` will be the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that meets all the specified conditions.
   - Without specific values for `x` and `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`, but we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of i or x // i that satisfies all the given conditions)**
