The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x.

The function's output is not specified in the given information, so I cannot provide a detailed description of what the function returns. However, based on the parameters and their constraints, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 10^3, `x` is between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is between 1 and `x`. The function's return value is not specified.**
