### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`. The approach taken by the program is to iterate through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and check if they can be used to form a valid set of sub-problems.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `x` and `n`.

2. **Divisor Search**: The program iterates through potential divisors `i` of `x` from 1 to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because any divisor larger than the square root would have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `x % i == 0` to ensure `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - It then checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` to ensure that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the `n` sub-problems.
   - Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` for the corresponding larger divisor `x // i`.

4. **Max GCD Calculation**: The program updates `ans` with the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions, ensuring the maximum possible GCD.

5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the maximum GCD of the sub-problems.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems for each test case. The conditions and calculations are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
