Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will have reached `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` will hold the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, so after all iterations, `i` will have reached `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- During each iteration, if the conditions `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` are met, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
- Similarly, if the conditions `x % i == 0`, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` are met, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.
- The values of `x`, `n`, and `t` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
