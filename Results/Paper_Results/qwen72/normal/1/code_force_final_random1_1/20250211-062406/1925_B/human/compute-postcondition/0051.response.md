To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `i` will have reached `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` after all iterations.
- `ans` will hold the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the following conditions:
  - `x % i == 0`
  - `x - n * i >= 0`
  - `(x - n * i) % i == 0`
  - `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`
  - `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`
- The values of `x`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.

### Explanation:
- The variable `i` iterates from 1 up to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- For each value of `i`, the code checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`).
- It then checks additional conditions involving `n` and `i` or `x // i`.
- If all conditions are satisfied, the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` is stored in `ans`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies all the given conditions. Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans` as described.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of i or x // i that satisfies the conditions x % i == 0, x - n * i >= 0, (x - n * i) % i == 0, x - n * (x // i) >= 0, and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)**
