Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, and `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 3. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
