You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import sqrt

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer where 1 <= n <= x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `i` will have reached `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` for each pair of `x` and `n` processed. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors `i` (from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))`) that satisfy the conditions: `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, and `x // i > 0`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` will remain 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged for each iteration, but `q` will have incremented from 0 to `t-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It iterates through potential divisors of \( x \) up to the square root of \( x \), checking if they can form a valid set of \( n \) sub-problems whose difficulties sum to \( x \). The program ensures that the chosen divisor maximizes the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Divisor Search**: It searches for divisors of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \) to optimize the search process.
3. **Valid Sub-problem Check**: For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( x \) can be divided into \( n \) sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of \( i \).
4. **Max GCD Calculation**: It updates the maximum GCD found so far if a valid set of sub-problems is found.
5. **Output**: It prints the maximum GCD for each test case.

The program handles edge cases and constraints effectively, ensuring that the solution is optimal for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
