The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop can execute if `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to the next value in the range, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. However, since the loop is about to start, `i` should actually be set to the next value in the sequence, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1 - 1 = int(sqrt(x))`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1 - 1 = int(sqrt(x))`.
- `x` must still be at least 1 for the loop to potentially execute.

Since the loop condition is `i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1)`, the loop will not execute if `i` is equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, the correct state for the next iteration is:

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` holds true, in which case `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `x // i`.**
