Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 1, and `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` without a remainder, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
