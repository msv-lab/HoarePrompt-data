The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then calculates the largest divisor `ans` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x` within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1. The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are not modified during the function's execution.
