Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.
- The code updates `m` to `15 * z - y * 4`.
- Since `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, substituting this into the equation for `m` gives `m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if m < a` is not checked in the given code snippet, so `z` and `m` retain their updated values.
