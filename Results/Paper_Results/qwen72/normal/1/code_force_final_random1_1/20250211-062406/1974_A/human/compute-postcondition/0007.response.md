Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is initially `(y + 1) // 2`. If `m` (which is `15 * z - y * 4`) is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` and `m` is updated to `15 * z - y * 4`, ensuring that the new value of `m` is still less than `a`. Otherwise, the values of `z` and `m` remain unchanged.***
