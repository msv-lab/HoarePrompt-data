Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula is used to determine the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the formula ensures that we account for the fact that a single 2x2 icon cannot be split across screens. This part is correct.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. This calculation is correct because it multiplies the number of screens by 15 (total cells per screen) and subtracts the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

4. **Adjustment for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space `m` is less than the number of test cases `a`, the program adjusts the number of screens `z` to accommodate the 1x1 icons. The adjustment is done using the formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on additional screens if necessary. However, there is a potential issue here: the comparison `if m < a` should actually be `if m < x` because `m` represents the remaining space for 1x1 icons, not the number of test cases.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final number of screens `z` for each test case. This part is correct.

Given the above analysis, the main issue is in the condition `if m < a`. It should be `if m < x` to correctly check if there is enough space for the 1x1 icons.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
```

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect condition in the if statement).
