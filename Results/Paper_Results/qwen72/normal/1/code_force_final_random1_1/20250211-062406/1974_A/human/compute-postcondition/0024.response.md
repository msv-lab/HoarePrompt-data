The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (indicated by `t`) where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y` within the range [0, 99]. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such functions would process each test case and return a result for each.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature and the typical structure of such problems, the function likely processes the test cases internally and returns results accordingly. Since the exact output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the common pattern for such problems.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99 and returns a result for each test case.**
