The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the user and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the user's input. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user within the range 0 to 99. After executing the code, the new values of `x` and `y` are set according to the user's input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `z`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`. If `m < a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15` and `m` is updated to `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. Otherwise, `z` and `m` retain their original values.**
