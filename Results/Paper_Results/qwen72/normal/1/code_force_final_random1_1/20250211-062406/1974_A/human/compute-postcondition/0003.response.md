Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which means `z` is the integer division of `y + 1` by 2. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
