You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the variable `_` has been incremented up to the value of `t`. For each iteration, the input integer `a` and the list of integers `b` were processed based on the conditions specified in the loop. If the first element of `b` was odd and the second element was not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` was odd and the second-to-last element was not equal to the last element plus 2, the program printed 'NO'. Otherwise, it printed 'YES'. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain as they were provided in the input, but the loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the first two and the last two elements of the array to determine if the operation can make all elements zero. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire array and the cumulative effect of the operations.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output "YES" because it only checks the first two elements (`1` and `2`) and the last two elements (`4` and `5`), which do not violate the conditions in the program. However, it is impossible to make all elements of this array zero using the given operation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider the sum of the elements and the parity of the elements in the array. A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and if the elements can be adjusted to zero through the operations. The provided program does not perform these checks, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
