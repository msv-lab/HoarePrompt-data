Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
