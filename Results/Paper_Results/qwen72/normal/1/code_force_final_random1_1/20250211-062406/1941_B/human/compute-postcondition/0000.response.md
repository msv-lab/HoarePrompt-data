The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the input must be a positive integer because the loop iterates based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, which corresponds to the value of `t`. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, specifically within the range of 1 to 10^4.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input must be a positive integer within this range for the loop to execute.**
