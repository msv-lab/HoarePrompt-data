Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `a[i] -= opNum` updates `a[1]` by subtracting `opNum` (which is `a[1]`) from `a[1]`.
- Since `a[1]` was already updated to `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` in the initial state, `a[1]` is now `a[1] - 2 * a[1] - a[1]`, which simplifies to `-2 * a[1]`.
- Given that `a[1]` is initially `a[1]` and is then updated to `-2 * a[1]`, `a[1]` becomes a negative value.
- Since `a[1]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
