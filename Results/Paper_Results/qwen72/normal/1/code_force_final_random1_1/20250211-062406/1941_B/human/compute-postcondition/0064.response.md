The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `opNum` is `a[1]`
- `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`
- `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * a[1]`
- `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`
- `a[1]` is less than 0
- `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 1, so `i + 2` is 3.
2. `opNum` is `a[1]`.
3. `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - a[1]`.

Since `a[1]` is less than 0, subtracting `a[1]` from `a[3]` will increase the value of `a[3]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` (and is less than 0), `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * a[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1]`, `stop` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
