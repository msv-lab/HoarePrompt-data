Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4, `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[1]` (and is less than 0), `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * a[1] - opNum` (and is less than 0), `a[3]` is `a[3] - a[1] - 2 * opNum - opNum`, and `stop` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[4]` (since `i` is 2) by subtracting `opNum` from it.
- Since `opNum` is `a[2]`, the new value of `a[4]` is `a[4] - a[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
