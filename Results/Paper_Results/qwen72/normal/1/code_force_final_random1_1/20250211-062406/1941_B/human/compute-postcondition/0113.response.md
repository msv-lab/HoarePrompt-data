The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from its current value. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `opNum` is 0.
- `a[3]` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it remains the same).

Since `2 * opNum` is 0 (because `opNum` is 0), the value of `a[3]` does not change.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is 0, `a[3]` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `opNum` is 0, `stop` is False.**
