To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions:

- `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot know the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`.

The code snippet returns `d` and `c` in that order.

Output State: **The program returns the values `d` and `c`, which are the second and first values, respectively, returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`.**
