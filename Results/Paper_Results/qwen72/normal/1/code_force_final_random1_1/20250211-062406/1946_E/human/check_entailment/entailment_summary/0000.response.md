### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The code starts by precomputing factorials up to \(200,000\) and storing them in the list `facts`. This is done to efficiently compute combinations later.
   - The factorial values are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, and if the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is 1 and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to compute combinations. The `func_2` function itself uses the `func_1` function to find the modular inverse of a number.
   - The combination formula used is \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{facts[n]}{facts[k] \times facts[n-k]} \), but since we are working modulo \(10^9 + 7\), the division is replaced by multiplication with the modular inverse.

5. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements.
   - It multiplies the results of the combination calculations and the factorials of the gaps between the maximums to get the final count of permutations.
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to avoid overflow.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. It handles edge cases and ensures that the results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
