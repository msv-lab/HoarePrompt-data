Correctness: **False**

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums, and the provided functions seem to be related to modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are not directly applicable to solving the permutation counting problem without additional context or integration into a solution that addresses the specific requirements of the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need a function that takes into account the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations. The provided functions do not appear to perform this task.
