    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)

        #The program returns the values `d` and `c`, which are the second and first values, respectively, returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -((a // b) - 1)), where 'a' is an integer greater than or equal to 'b', 'b' is a positive integer, and 'a' is divisible by 'b' with no remainder. The second element of the tuple is the negative of the quotient of 'a' divided by 'b' minus 1.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` is the second value returned by `func_1(b, a % b)` and `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the first value `c` returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`, the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following conditions: If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0). If `a` is less than `b`, it returns a tuple with the second and first elements swapped from the result of `func_1(b, a)`. If `a` is divisible by `b` with no remainder, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the length of b is at least 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, `a` is an integer, and `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters: an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a length of at least 1). It returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. After the function concludes, the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function has no side effects on any other variables or the program state.
