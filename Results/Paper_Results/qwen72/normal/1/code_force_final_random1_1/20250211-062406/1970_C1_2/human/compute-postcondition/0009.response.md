The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. This updates the values of `a` and `b` to the new input values.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` includes `b` as its last element, and the list at key `b` now includes `a` as its last element; `x` is greater than 2; `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `a` is the first integer from the new input; `b` is the second integer from the new input.**
