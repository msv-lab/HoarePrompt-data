Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the new user's input, `b` is the second integer from the new user's input, `m` is the third integer from the new user's input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mn` is updated to be the sum of the minimum of `a` and `b` and the value of `m`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`) remain unchanged.
