Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    mn = min(a, b) + m
    if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:
        print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
    else:
        print(mn // a + mn // b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the conditions for divisibility and non-unity of `a` and `b` are met. Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the user's input, `b` is the second integer from the user's input, `m` is the third integer from the user's input, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the conditions for divisibility and non-unity of `a` and `b` are met. Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the new user's input, `b` is the second integer from the new user's input, `m` is the third integer from the new user's input, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the postcondition remains as described. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
