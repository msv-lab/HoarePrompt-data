Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time, given the firing intervals of two installations and the visibility duration of each firework. Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation of `mn`**:
   - `mn = min(a, b) + m`: This variable `mn` represents the time when the first overlap of fireworks from both installations could occur, considering the visibility duration `m`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. This condition is intended to handle special cases where the visibility duration `m` is a multiple of both firing intervals, which might lead to additional overlaps.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Overlaps**:
   - The calculation `mn // a + mn // b` does not correctly account for the number of fireworks visible at the same time. It simply counts how many times each installation fires within the period `mn`, but it doesn't consider the actual visibility overlap.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1` is overly restrictive and doesn't cover all cases where overlaps can occur.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points where both installations fire simultaneously.
   - We also need to consider the visibility duration `m` to determine the total number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
