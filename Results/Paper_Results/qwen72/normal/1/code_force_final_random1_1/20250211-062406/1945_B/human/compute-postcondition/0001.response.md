To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `t`.
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` should start at 0.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0**.
