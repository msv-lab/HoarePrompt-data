To determine what will be printed by the `print(mn // a + mn // b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - Either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.

2. **Calculation of `mn`:**
   - `mn = min(a, b) + m`

3. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression `mn // a + mn // b` involves integer division of `mn` by `a` and `b`, and then summing the results.

4. **Understanding the Values:**
   - `mn` is the sum of the minimum of `a` and `b` and `m`.
   - `mn // a` gives the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - `mn // b` gives the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

5. **Conditions:**
   - The conditions ensure that either `m` is not divisible by `a` or `b`, or one of `a` or `b` is 1. This affects the divisibility but does not change the fundamental arithmetic operations.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - The result of `mn // a + mn // b` will be the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b`.

Output: **(mn // a + mn // b) (where mn is the minimum of a and b plus m, and a, b, and m are integers derived from the user's input)**
