Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the new user's input, `b` is the second integer from the new user's input, `m` is the third integer from the new user's input, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the postcondition remains as described. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
