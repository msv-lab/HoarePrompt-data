To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input.
- `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
- `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`.
- Neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mn`:**
   - `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - Let's denote the minimum of `a` and `b` as `min(a, b)`.
   - Therefore, `mn = min(a, b) + m`.

2. **Calculate `mn // a` and `mn // b`:**
   - Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, `m` can be expressed as \( m = k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \) for some integer \( k \).
   - `mn` can be rewritten as \( mn = \min(a, b) + k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \).

3. **Evaluate `mn // a` and `mn // b`:**
   - `mn // a` is the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - `mn // b` is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

4. **Sum the Results:**
   - The expression `mn // a + mn // b + 1` needs to be evaluated.
   - Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, `k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)` is also divisible by both `a` and `b`.
   - Therefore, `mn // a` and `mn // b` will be integers.

### Final Calculation:
- `mn // a` is the number of times `a` fits into `mn`.
- `mn // b` is the number of times `b` fits into `mn`.
- Adding 1 to the sum of these two values gives the final result.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `m = 6` (since 6 is divisible by both 2 and 3).
- `mn = min(2, 3) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8`.
- `mn // a = 8 // 2 = 4`.
- `mn // b = 8 // 3 = 2`.
- The final result is `4 + 2 + 1 = 7`.

### General Case:
- For any valid `a`, `b`, and `m` where `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the expression `mn // a + mn // b + 1` will always yield a specific integer value based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

### Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `mn // a + mn // b + 1`, where `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, and `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

Output: **mn // a + mn // b + 1 (where mn is the minimum of a and b plus m, and m is divisible by both a and b)**
