Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after all iterations. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This remains an integer within the specified range, indicating the total number of test cases.
- **`_`**: After all iterations, `_` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs `t` times, and the loop variable `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time.
- **`n`**: For each test case, `n` is an input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
- **`ar`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user input for each test case.
- **`res`**: After processing each test case, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- **`mex`**: The variable `mex` is updated in each iteration of the inner loop to be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after all iterations.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is `-1` after the inner loop completes, as it decrements from `len(ar) - 1` to `-1`.

This output state reflects the final condition of the variables after all test cases have been processed.
