Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` using the MEX operation. The key part of the logic is to calculate the value of `p[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of the permutation up to index `i`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initialization of `mex`:**
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation. This is because initially, all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are potential candidates for the MEX.

2. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The program iterates backward from the last element to the first element of the array `ar`. This is crucial because the MEX of a larger prefix can be determined more easily when we know the values of the smaller prefixes.

3. **Updating `mex`:**
   - The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of the permutation up to the current index `i`.

4. **Constructing `res`:**
   - The result list `res` is constructed by setting `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the resulting permutation `res` for each test case.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- The logic of updating `mex` and constructing `res` aligns with the problem's definition of the MEX operation and the construction of the array `a`.
- The backward iteration ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each prefix of the permutation.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

- **First Test Case:**
  - `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - `mex = 5`
  - `res = [None, None, None, None, None]`
  - Backward iteration:
    - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
    - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
    - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4` (but `mex` should be 2, so no change)
    - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
    - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `ar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `mex = 5`
  - `res = [None, None, None, None, None]`
  - Backward iteration:
    - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
    - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
    - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
    - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
    - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `ar = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - `mex = 3`
  - `res = [None, None, None]`
  - Backward iteration:
    - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
    - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
    - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 2` (but `mex` should be 0, so no change)
  - Output: `2 0 1`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the MEX operation. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem requirements.
