To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `ar`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`, where:
   - `start` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `stop` is `-1`
   - `step` is `-1`

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the `start` value must be greater than or equal to the `stop` value. In this case, `len(ar) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `len(ar) - 1` must be at least 0, which means `len(ar)` must be at least 1.
   - Therefore, `ar` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `_` is 1 (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `n` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` (this does not affect the loop execution).
   - `mex` is now equal to `n` (this does not affect the loop execution).

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `ar` must have at least one element. The initial state of `i` should be `len(ar) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
