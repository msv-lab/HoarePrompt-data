To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[j]` is `mex - ar[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `[n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))]`.
- `i` is `-1` (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mex`**:
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `[n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))]`.
   - This means we need to compute the list `[n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))]` and find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in this list.

2. **Constructing `res`**:
   - For each element `ar[j]` in the list `ar`, the corresponding element in `res` is `mex - ar[j]`.

3. **Printing `res`**:
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space, then prints the resulting string.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 5`
- `ar = [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]`

#### Step 1: Compute the list `[n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))]`:
- `n - ar[0] = 5 - 1 = 4`
- `n - ar[1] = 5 - 3 = 2`
- `n - ar[2] = 5 - 4 = 1`
- `n - ar[3] = 5 - 2 = 3`
- `n - ar[4] = 5 - 5 = 0`

So, the list is `[4, 2, 1, 3, 0]`.

#### Step 2: Find `mex`:
- The smallest non-negative integer not in `[4, 2, 1, 3, 0]` is `5`.

#### Step 3: Construct `res`:
- `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 5 - 1 = 4`
- `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 5 - 3 = 2`
- `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 5 - 4 = 1`
- `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 5 - 2 = 3`
- `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = 5 - 5 = 0`

So, `res` is `[4, 2, 1, 3, 0]`.

#### Step 4: Print `res`:
- The `print` statement will join the elements of `res` with a space and print the result.

### Final Output:
Output: **4 2 1 3 0**

This output is based on the specific example provided. In general, the output will be the elements of `res` joined by spaces, where each element is `mex - ar[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
