Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar[len(ar) - 3]` is greater than 0, `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` which is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `mex` is set to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
- The code snippet updates `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, and `ar[len(ar) - 3]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
- Therefore, `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which simplifies to `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
