Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` which is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `res[len(ar) - 3]` which is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
