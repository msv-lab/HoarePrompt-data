Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` no longer holds true.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `ar[i]` is the last element of the list `ar`.
- The new value of `mex` is `n - ar[i]`.
- The condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` no longer holds true because `mex` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
