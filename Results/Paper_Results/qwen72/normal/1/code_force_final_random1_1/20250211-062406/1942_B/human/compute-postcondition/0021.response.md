Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of integers where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `mex` is the result of repeatedly subtracting each element of `ar` from the initial value `n` as long as `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is now assigned the value of an integer input provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `n` is determined by the user's input, but it is now an integer.
- The conditions and relationships defined for `t`, `_`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` remain valid and unchanged.
