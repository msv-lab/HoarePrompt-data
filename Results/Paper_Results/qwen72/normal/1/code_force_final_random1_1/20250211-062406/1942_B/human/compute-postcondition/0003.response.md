Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n`.** 

The code initializes a new list `res` with a length equal to the value of `n`, and each element in the list is set to `None`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
