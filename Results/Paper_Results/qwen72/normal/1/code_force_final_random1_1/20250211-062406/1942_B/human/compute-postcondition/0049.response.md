Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, and `ar[i]` is greater than 0.***
