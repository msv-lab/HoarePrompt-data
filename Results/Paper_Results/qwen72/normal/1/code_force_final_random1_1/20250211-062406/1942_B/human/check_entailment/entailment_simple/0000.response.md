Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a[i]` is defined as the difference between the MEX of the prefix `p[1:i+1]` and the value `p[i]`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm initializes `mex` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The initialization of `mex` to `n` is appropriate because the MEX of a full permutation of size `n` is `n` (since all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present).
   - The reverse iteration ensures that the MEX is correctly updated based on the values already placed in `res`.
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is updated only when necessary, which helps maintain the correct MEX value for the next iteration.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, which is valid according to the problem constraints.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The final output is a list of integers that should match the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The program prints the result for each test case, ensuring that the output format is correct.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The program correctly reconstructs a valid permutation `p` from the given array `a`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
