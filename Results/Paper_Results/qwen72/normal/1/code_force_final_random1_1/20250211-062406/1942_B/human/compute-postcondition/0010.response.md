To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element.
- `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`.
- `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` held true.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- The loop variable `i` is adjusted by the loop itself, decrementing by 1 each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(ar) - 2`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `_` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains unchanged.
- `mex` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `len(ar) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` held true, and `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
