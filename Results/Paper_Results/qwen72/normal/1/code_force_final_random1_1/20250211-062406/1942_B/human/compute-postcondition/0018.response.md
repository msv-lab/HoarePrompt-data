Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of integers where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `mex` is the result of repeatedly subtracting each element of `ar` from the initial value `n` as long as `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true. The final value of `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The list `ar` remains the same list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `res` is now fully populated with integers, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- The variable `mex` is updated during the loop to be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after all iterations.
