Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is indeed not used in the provided code, so we will focus on `func_2`.
2. `func_2` takes a string `s` as input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
3. It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the cumulative balance of parentheses, the index, and the character at that index.
4. It iterates over the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of parentheses. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
5. After the loop, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by the position (in descending order). This sorting ensures that the characters are ordered according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.
6. Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement for performing the balanced shuffle operation. The sorting criteria ensure that the sequence is shuffled according to the specified rules, and the resulting string is a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
