Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Class Definition**: The `BalanceInfo` class is used to store the balance, position, and character information for each character in the input string. This helps in organizing the data needed for the sorting step.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes the `balance` variable to 0 and creates an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - **Loop**: The loop iterates over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list with the current balance, position, and character. It then updates the `balance` based on whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis.
   - **Sorting**: The `balance_info` list is sorted using a custom key. The key sorts primarily by the balance in ascending order and secondarily by the position in descending order (using `-x.position` to achieve this).
   - **Result Construction**: The sorted `balance_info` list is used to construct the result string by joining the characters in the order they appear after sorting.
   - **Output**: The result string is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not directly used in the main logic but serves as a comparison function for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position, which aligns with the sorting requirements specified in the problem.

The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem statement to produce the balanced shuffle of the input string. The sorting and construction of the result string ensure that the output is a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

Correctness: **True**
