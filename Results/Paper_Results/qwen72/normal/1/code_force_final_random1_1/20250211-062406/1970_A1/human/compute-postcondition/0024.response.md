Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s` and remains unchanged. `balance_info` is now a sorted list of `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object. The list is sorted first by increasing `balance` and then by decreasing `position` in case of ties. `result` is a string constructed by concatenating the `character` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in `balance_info`.**
