### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task requires transforming a balanced parentheses sequence into its "balanced shuffle" by sorting the characters based on their prefix balances and positions.
   - The prefix balance is calculated as the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses up to that point.
   - The sorting criteria are:
     - First, by the prefix balance in ascending order.
     - Second, by the position in descending order (to break ties).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function is used as a custom comparator for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
     - If the balances are different, it returns the difference in balances.
     - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in positions (in reverse order to sort by position in descending order).
     - This function is not directly used in the main logic but could be used as a custom key in sorting.

   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - This function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - Each `BalanceInfo` object contains:
       - `balance`: the cumulative balance of parentheses up to that point.
       - `position`: the index of the character in the original string.
       - `character`: the character itself ('(' or ')').
     - The function then sorts this list using a lambda function that sorts by `balance` and `-position`.
     - Finally, it constructs a new string from the sorted list and prints it.

3. **Validation Using the Function Summary**:
   - The function summary confirms that `func_2` correctly processes the input string, calculates the prefix balances, and sorts the characters based on the specified criteria.
   - The sorting criteria ensure that the characters are rearranged to form a valid balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The function prints the rearranged string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
   - The sorting logic and the construction of the new string are consistent with the requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
