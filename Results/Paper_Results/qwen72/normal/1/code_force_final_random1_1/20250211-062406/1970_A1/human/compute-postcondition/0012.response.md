The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the `balance` attribute of the `BalanceInfo` objects by 1. Since both `BalanceInfo` objects in the `balance_info` list have their `balance` attribute set to the same value (either 1 or -1 depending on the second character of `s`), both `balance` attributes will be incremented by 1.

Let's break down the changes:

- The `balance` attribute of the first `BalanceInfo` object was initially 1 if the second character of `s` is '(', or -1 if the second character of `s` is ')'. After the increment, the `balance` attribute of the first `BalanceInfo` object will be 2 if the second character of `s` is '(', or 0 if the second character of `s` is ')'.
- Similarly, the `balance` attribute of the second `BalanceInfo` object was initially the same as the first `BalanceInfo` object's `balance` attribute. After the increment, the `balance` attribute of the second `BalanceInfo` object will also be 2 if the second character of `s` is '(', or 0 if the second character of `s` is ')'.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 1, `s[i]` set to the second character of `s`, and `balance` set to 2 if the second character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to 0. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to the same value as the first object's `balance`, `i` set to 1, and `s[i]` set to the second character of `s`.**
