The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list by 1. Let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`, and `balance` set to 2 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -2.
     - The second `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to the same value as the first object's `balance`, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`.
     - The third `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to the same value as the first object's `balance`, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list is incremented by 1.

3. **Updated State**:
   - The `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object is now increased by 1.
   - If the third character of `s` is '(', the initial `balance` for each `BalanceInfo` object was 2, so after incrementing, the new `balance` is 3.
   - If the third character of `s` is ')', the initial `balance` for each `BalanceInfo` object was -2, so after incrementing, the new `balance` is -1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`, and `balance` set to 3 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -1. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to 3 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -1, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`. The third `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to 3 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -1, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`.**
