Reasoning:  
The program is designed to perform the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**: This class is used to store the balance, position, and character information for each character in the input string. This is essential for keeping track of the necessary data during the processing.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is a comparison function used for sorting. It ensures that the `BalanceInfo` objects are sorted primarily by their balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, by their position in descending order. This matches the requirement of the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function performs the main logic of the program:
   - It iterates through the input string `s`, maintaining a running balance of parentheses.
   - For each character, it creates a `BalanceInfo` object and appends it to a list.
   - After processing the entire string, it sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects using the custom comparison function `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the shuffled string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the output is a valid balanced parentheses sequence, and the sorting criteria are applied correctly to achieve the desired rearrangement.

Correctness: **True**
