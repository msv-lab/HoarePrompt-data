Output State: **`s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` (the second character in the original `s`) with `unique_chars[j]` (where `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` if `char` is in `unique_chars`, otherwise `j` is `len(unique_chars)`), `i` is 0 if `char` is in `unique_chars` and 1 if `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` if `char` is in `unique_chars` and `len(unique_chars)` if `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s` with `char` added at index 0 if `char` was not originally in `unique_chars`.**
