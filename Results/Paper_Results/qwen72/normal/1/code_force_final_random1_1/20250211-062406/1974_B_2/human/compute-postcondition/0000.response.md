The code snippet creates a set of unique characters from the string `s`, converts this set into a list, and then sorts this list alphabetically. This sorted list of unique characters is stored in the variable `unique_chars`.

- The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
- After executing the code, `unique_chars` will contain a sorted list of unique characters found in `s`.
- The length of `unique_chars` will be less than or equal to the number of unique lowercase Latin letters (which is 26), and it will be sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`.**
