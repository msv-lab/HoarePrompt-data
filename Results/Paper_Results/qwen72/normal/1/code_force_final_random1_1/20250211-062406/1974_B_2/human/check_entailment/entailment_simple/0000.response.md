Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Character Replacement**: The loop inside `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with characters from the `unique_chars` list. However, the logic for replacing characters is flawed. Specifically, the `replace` method is used to replace all occurrences of a character in the string `s` with another character, which is not the intended behavior for decoding. The decoding process should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string based on the symmetric positions in the `unique_chars` list.

2. **Modification of `unique_chars` List**: The program incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters that are not in the original `unique_chars` list. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the decoding process.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is not the decoded string but rather a string of unique characters in the order they were processed. This is not the correct output for the problem.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:

- Construct the `unique_chars` list from the encoded string.
- Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string based on the symmetric positions in the `unique_chars` list.
- Use this mapping to construct the decoded string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected version correctly decodes the string by creating a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string and then using this mapping to construct the decoded string.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
