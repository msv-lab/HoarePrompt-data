You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

The indices `i` and `j` will be such that `i` is equal to the number of unique characters that were not originally in `unique_chars` and were added during the loop, and `j` will be `len(unique_chars) - 1` minus the number of unique characters that were replaced in `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the specified algorithm. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `func_1` function handles the replacement of characters. The function attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with a corresponding character from the `unique_chars` list, but it does not correctly maintain the mapping between the original characters and their symmetric counterparts.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
The actual output will not match the expected output because the function incorrectly manipulates the `unique_chars` list and does not correctly map the characters in the string `s` to their symmetric counterparts.

To illustrate, let's walk through the function step-by-step with the input "serofedsoc":

1. `unique_chars` is initialized as `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`.
2. The function iterates over each character in the string "serofedsoc":
   - For 's': It replaces 's' with 'c' and updates `j` to 5.
   - For 'e': It replaces 'e' with 'r' and updates `j` to 4.
   - For 'r': It replaces 'r' with 'o' and updates `j` to 3.
   - For 'o': It replaces 'o' with 'f' and updates `j` to 2.
   - For 'f': It replaces 'f' with 'e' and updates `j` to 1.
   - For 'e': It replaces 'e' with 'd' and updates `j` to 0.
   - For 'd': It replaces 'd' with 'c' and updates `j` to -1.
   - For 's': It replaces 's' with 'c' and updates `j` to -2.
   - For 'o': It replaces 'o' with 'c' and updates `j` to -3.
   - For 'c': It replaces 'c' with 'c' and updates `j` to -4.

As you can see, the function does not correctly handle the symmetric replacement, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
