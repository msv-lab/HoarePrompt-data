The code `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` into the list `unique_chars` at the position specified by `i`. This affects the list `unique_chars` by adding a new element at the index `i`, shifting all elements after this index one position to the right.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s`.
- `char` is the next character in `s`.
- `i` is 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the previous condition.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1` depending on the previous condition.

After executing the code:
- The list `unique_chars` now includes the character `char` at the index `i`.
- The length of `unique_chars` is increased by 1.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the insertion operation.
- The values of `s` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `char` is the next character in `s`, `i` is 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the previous condition, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1` depending on the previous condition, and `unique_chars` has a new length of `len(unique_chars) + 1`.**
