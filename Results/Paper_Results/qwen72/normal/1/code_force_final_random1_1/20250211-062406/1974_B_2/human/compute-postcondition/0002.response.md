Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.**

Explanation: The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 and the length of `unique_chars` minus 1, respectively. The initial state of `s` and `unique_chars` remains unchanged.
