The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If there are elements left in `numbers`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the first element of `numbers`, and `numbers` had at least one element (since the loop executed).

For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still have elements remaining. After the last iteration, the first element of `numbers` would have been processed, so for the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in `numbers`.

State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` remains a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, but it has one less element than before.
- `group_a` now contains `[num]`.
- `group_b` and `group_c` remain empty lists.
- `sum_a` is now `num`.
- `sum_b` and `sum_c` remain 0.
- `num` is the second element of `numbers` (which is now the first element of the updated `numbers`).**
