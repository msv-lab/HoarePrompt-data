Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is an empty list. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` contain the elements from the original `numbers` list distributed according to the `distribute_number` function. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list, which initially has `n` elements.
- After each iteration, the current number (`num`) is distributed among `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c` based on the `distribute_number` function.
- The `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` variables accumulate the sum of the elements added to `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively.
- Once the loop completes, `numbers` is empty because all elements have been processed.
- The variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The final state of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` will depend on how the `distribute_number` function distributes the elements, but the total number of elements in these groups will still sum up to `n`.
