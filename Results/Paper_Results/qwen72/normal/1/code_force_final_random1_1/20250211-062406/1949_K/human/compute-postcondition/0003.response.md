The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must contain at least one element. Since the initial state already specifies that `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer, this condition is already met.

However, for the loop to start, the first element of `numbers` should be assigned to `num`. Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to set `num` to the first element of `numbers`.

State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all initialized to 0, `num` is the first element of `numbers`**
