Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list of indices, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and the length of `final` is 0, and `c1` is less than 50.**
