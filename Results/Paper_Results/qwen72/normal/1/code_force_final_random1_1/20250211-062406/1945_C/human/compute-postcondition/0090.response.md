Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in the new `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in the new `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` if the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 if the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `c1` is less than 50 if the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is less than 50, and `t` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 0, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 1.
- Therefore, `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // 1`, which simplifies to `zero * 100`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
