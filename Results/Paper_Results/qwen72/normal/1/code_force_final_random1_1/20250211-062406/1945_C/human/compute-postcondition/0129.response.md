Postcondition: ***`lst` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, and `mini` is updated to the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` contains the first element of `lst` and `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.***
