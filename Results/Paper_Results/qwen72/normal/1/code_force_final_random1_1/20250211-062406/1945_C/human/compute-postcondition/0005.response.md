The value of `pk` is assigned the result of `n / 2`. Since `n` is an even input integer, `pk` will be a floating-point number that is half of `n`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that is even, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2` (a floating-point number).**
