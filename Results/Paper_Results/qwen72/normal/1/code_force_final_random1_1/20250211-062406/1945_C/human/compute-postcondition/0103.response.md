The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and `n` is the total number of iterations allowed plus one.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- If `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes the value `i + 1`

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1
- `n` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (i + 1) - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, and if `s[i + 1]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes the value `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
