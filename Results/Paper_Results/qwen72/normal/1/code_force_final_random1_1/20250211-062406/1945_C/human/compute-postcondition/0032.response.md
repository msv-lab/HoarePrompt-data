The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is `n / 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`
- `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`
- `lst` is an empty list
- `mini` is 100000000
- `i` is 1
- `zero` is 2 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 1
- `one` is 0 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is 1
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which is 50 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 33
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`
- If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [1]

After executing `lst.append(i + 1)`:
- `i + 1` is 2
- `lst` is now `[1, 2]` if `lst` was initially `[1]`, or `[2]` if `lst` was initially `[]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is `[2]` if `lst` was initially `[]` or `[1, 2]` if `lst` was initially `[1]`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `zero` is 1, `one` is 0 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50 if the character at index `1` in `s` is '0' otherwise `zero_perc` is 33, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**
