The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a sequence of preferences for living on the left or right side of a road in a village. However, the function definition provided is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of houses `n` and the sequence of preferences `a`. For example, the function might be defined as `def func(n, a):`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of houses (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', representing the preferences of the residents.
