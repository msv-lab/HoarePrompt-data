### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` is defined without any parameters, but it should take `n` and `a` as parameters according to the problem description. This is a significant issue because the function needs to process these inputs to solve the problem.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over them. For each test case, it reads `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences.

3. **Road Position Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the midpoint `pk` as `n / 2` (which should be `n // 2` to ensure it is an integer).
   - It initializes `zero` and `one` to count the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string `s` to find positions where the road can be placed such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This is done by checking the percentage of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.
   - It appends valid positions to the list `lst`.

4. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function then finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the midpoint `pk`.
   - If no valid positions are found, it checks the overall satisfaction of the entire village and decides whether to place the road before the first house (0) or after the last house (`n`).

5. **Output**: The function prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition**: The function should be defined as `def func(n, a):` to match the problem description.
- **Midpoint Calculation**: `pk` should be calculated as `n // 2` to ensure it is an integer.
- **Percentage Calculation**: The percentage calculation is unnecessary and can be simplified to directly check if the counts meet the required conditions.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the function definition and the unnecessary complexity in the percentage calculation, the program is not fully correct. However, the logic for finding the optimal position is generally sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
