Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, and if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes the value `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
