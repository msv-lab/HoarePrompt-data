Output State: **`lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. `ele` is the last element processed in `lst`. `mini` is the minimum of its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. All other variables (`final`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`lst`**: This list contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. The loop iterates over these indices.
- **`ele`**: After the loop finishes, `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst`.
- **`mini`**: Initially set to a large value (100000000), `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n / 2`) and each element in `lst`. By the end of the loop, `mini` will hold the smallest of these differences.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
