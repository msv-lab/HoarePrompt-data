Output State: **`lst` has all its original elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `lst` remains unchanged, `ele` still holds the last element of `lst`, `mini` is set to the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, and `final` contains all the elements from `lst` that have this smallest absolute difference with `pk`.
