Output State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last `ele` processed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- The values of `lst` and `ele` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `mini` is the smaller of the original `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.
