Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The variable `elem` is the last element processed in `lst`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, `ele`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `final` will contain all the elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to the minimum value `mini`. The variable `elem` will hold the last element processed from `lst`. All other variables that were not modified within the loop remain unchanged.
