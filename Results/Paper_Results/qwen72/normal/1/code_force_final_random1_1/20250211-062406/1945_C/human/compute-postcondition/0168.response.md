Output State: **`lst` is an empty list or a list containing `[1]` based on whether `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50. `ele` is undefined, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 50. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0. In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.**
