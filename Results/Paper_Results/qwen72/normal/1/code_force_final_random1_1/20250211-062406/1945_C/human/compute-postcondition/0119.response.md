Output State: **`lst` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `final`. This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `lst`, `ele`, and `mini` remain unchanged, while `final` is now an empty list.
