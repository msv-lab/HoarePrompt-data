Postcondition: ***`lst` has all its original elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, `final` now includes either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively, and the length of `final` is 1.***
