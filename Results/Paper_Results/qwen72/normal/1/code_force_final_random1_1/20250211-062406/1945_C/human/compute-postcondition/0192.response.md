Postcondition: ***`lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 1 element. `elem` is the first element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `[elem]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, `ele`) remain unchanged.***
