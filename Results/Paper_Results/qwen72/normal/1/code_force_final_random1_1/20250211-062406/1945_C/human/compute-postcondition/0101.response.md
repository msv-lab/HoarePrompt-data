The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1, `lst` now includes the value `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
