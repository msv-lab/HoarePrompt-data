Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a sequence of preferences for living on the left or right side of a road in a village, but the function definition is incomplete. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n / 2
    else:
        pk = n / 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
        one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list of indices, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`. If the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50. If `c1` is less than 50, the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is less than 50.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` has all its original elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, `final` now includes either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively, and the length of `final` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The variable `elem` is the last element processed in `lst`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, `ele`) remain unchanged. If the length of `final` is 0, then `final` contains either the element 0 (if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50) or the value `n` (if `c1` is less than 50). Otherwise, the length of `final` remains as it was before the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
