Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + 2 * y`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd, and is sorted in ascending order, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, and is sorted in ascending order, `y` is 0, `gap` is the first element in `even`, and the current value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
