The code snippet updates the value of `t2` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`.

The other variables (`i`, `x`, `t1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The conditions for updating `ans` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
