Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `tmp` is an empty list. If the difference between the current element `a[ii]` and the previous element `a[ii - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is updated to contain the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If the difference is not 2 and does not meet the above conditions, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`, and `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list or contains one element equal to `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition `(a[1] - a[0]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` is met, `i` is 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is either undefined or set to `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition `(a[1] - a[0]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` is met, and `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is met, `tmp` now contains the first element `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` and the second element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`. If the condition is not met, `tmp` remains as it was initially, and `ans` and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
