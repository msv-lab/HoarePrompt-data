Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd and must have at least 1 element, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order, `odd` is also sorted in ascending order, `gap` is the first element in the list `odd`, `y` is `y - gap // 2`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
