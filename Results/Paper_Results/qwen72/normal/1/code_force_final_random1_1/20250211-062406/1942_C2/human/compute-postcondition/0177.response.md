Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd`, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division).**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: Remains `x - 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`next_elem`**: Remains `a[0] + n` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`gap`**: After all iterations, `gap` will be the last element in the `odd` list because the loop iterates over each element in `odd`.
- **`odd`**: Remains a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order.
- **`even`**: Remains a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order.
- **`ans`**: Increases by the sum of all elements in `odd` because for each `gap` in `odd`, `ans` is incremented by `gap`.
- **`y`**: Decreases by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (using integer division) because for each `gap` in `odd`, `y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. If `y` becomes less than `gap // 2` at any point, the loop breaks, and `y` is set to 0. However, if the loop completes without breaking, `y` will be reduced by the total sum of these halves.
