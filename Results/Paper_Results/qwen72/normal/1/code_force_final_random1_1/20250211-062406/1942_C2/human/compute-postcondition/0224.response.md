The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `x` must still be greater than `i` (so `x` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
