### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of vertices `a` chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we start with the assumption that all chosen vertices can form triangles.

3. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of vertices `a` to handle gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it increments `ans` by 1 because a triangle can be formed.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, it checks if there are enough remaining vertices `y` to fill the gap. If so, it adds the number of triangles that can be formed and decrements `y` accordingly.

4. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex:**
   - The function also handles the gap between the last and first vertex in the sorted list.
   - Similar to the previous step, it checks if the gap is exactly 2 or even and greater than 2, and updates `ans` and `y` accordingly.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The function adds any remaining vertices `y` to `ans` to account for additional triangles that can be formed.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in an `n`-sided polygon is `n - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for handling gaps between vertices and the special case of the gap between the last and first vertex is correctly implemented.
- The initial answer calculation and the final adjustment ensure that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is correctly computed.
- The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately.
