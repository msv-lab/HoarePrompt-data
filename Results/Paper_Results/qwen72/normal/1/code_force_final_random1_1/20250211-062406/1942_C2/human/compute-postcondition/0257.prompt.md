Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing one element which is `gap`, and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or even, `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is an empty list if `gap` is less than or equal to 1, or `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`, `gap` is `a[x + 1] - a[x] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing two instances of `gap`, and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is a list containing `gap`. If `gap` is 1 or less, `odd` is a list containing one instance of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[0 - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0 - 1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `a[1] - a[0] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing two instances of `gap`, and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is a list containing `gap`. If `gap` is 1, `odd` is a list containing one instance of `gap`, and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is 0 or less, `odd` and `even` are both empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
