Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is equal to the initial value of `tt`, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list of integers, and `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop's operations for all iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer within the specified range.
- **`x`**: Remains an input integer within the specified range.
- **`y`**: Remains an input integer, but its value changes during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions inside the loop.
- **`tt`**: Remains the same as the initial value, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ii`**: After the loop completes, `ii` will be `tt - 1`, because the loop runs from `0` to `tt - 1`.
- **`i`**: Inside the loop, `i` is always `len(a) - 1` after the inner loop completes.
- **`a`**: Remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order, as it is sorted at the beginning of each iteration.
- **`tmp`**: Remains a list of integers, which may contain values added during the loop based on the conditions.
- **`ans`**: After all iterations, `ans` will be the final computed value based on the loop's operations, including the final addition of `y` in each iteration.
