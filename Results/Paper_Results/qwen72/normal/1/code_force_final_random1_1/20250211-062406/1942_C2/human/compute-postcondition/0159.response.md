Output State: **`i` is the last element of `val`, `val` remains a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is the last element of `val` divided by 2, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c` (if such a condition occurs) or the sum of all elements in `val` plus any additional adjustments based on the `y < c` condition, `y` is reduced by the sum of the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 up to the point where the loop breaks (if it does), `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.**
