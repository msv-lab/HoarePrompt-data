Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, and `ans` is initially `x + y - 2`. If the difference between the second and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. If the difference is not 2 and not even, or if `y` is not greater than half of the difference minus 1, then `ans` remains `x + y - 2`.***
