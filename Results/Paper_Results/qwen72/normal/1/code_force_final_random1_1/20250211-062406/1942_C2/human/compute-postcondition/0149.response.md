Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + i`, `y` is `y - 2 * c`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y -= c` is executed, which subtracts the value of `c` from `y`.
- Since `c` is already defined as `i // 2`, the new value of `y` becomes `y - c`.
- The rest of the variables (`i`, `val`, `x`, `c`, and `sx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Therefore, the updated value of `y` is `y - 2 * c` because the initial state already mentioned `y` is `y - c`, and the code further subtracts `c` from `y`.
