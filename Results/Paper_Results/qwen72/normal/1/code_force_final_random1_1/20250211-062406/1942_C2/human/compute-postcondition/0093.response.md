The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, and the difference between the second element and the first element of the list `a` is 2.**
