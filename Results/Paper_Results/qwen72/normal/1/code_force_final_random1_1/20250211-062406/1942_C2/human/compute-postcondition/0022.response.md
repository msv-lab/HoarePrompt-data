Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition `(a[1] - a[0]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` is met, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list or contains one element equal to `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition is met, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either undefined or set to `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition is met.***
