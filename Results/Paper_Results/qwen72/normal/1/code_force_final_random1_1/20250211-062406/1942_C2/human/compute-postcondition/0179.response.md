Postcondition: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd`, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division), and the current value of `y` is less than half of the last element in `odd` (`gap // 2`).**
