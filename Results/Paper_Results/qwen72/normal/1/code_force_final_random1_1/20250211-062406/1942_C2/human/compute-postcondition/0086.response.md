Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list containing values that satisfy the condition `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for some indices `j`, and `ans` is the final value after all updates based on the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`.**

Explanation:
- The line `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively.
- The values of `t`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the input, and they must satisfy the given constraints.
