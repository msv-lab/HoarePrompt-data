Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop plus `y * 2` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was 1 during the loop, and `sx` is now `sx + i + y * 2`, `y` is `y - c`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
