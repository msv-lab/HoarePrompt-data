Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is either unchanged or updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `tmp` is a list that may contain the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` in addition to its previous contents, and `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
