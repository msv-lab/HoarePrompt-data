The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the second element of `a`, and `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(a[0] / 2) + math.floor(a[1] / 2)`, `x` is the third element of `a`.**
