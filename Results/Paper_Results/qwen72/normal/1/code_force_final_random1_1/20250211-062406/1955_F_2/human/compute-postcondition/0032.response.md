Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt` is 1, `x` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`t`, `p_i`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
