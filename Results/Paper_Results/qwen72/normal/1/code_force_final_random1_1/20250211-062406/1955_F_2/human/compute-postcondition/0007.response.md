The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and then maps each element to its nearest even number by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. This effectively ensures that all numbers in the list `p` are even.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `p` is a list of even integers derived from the current input
- The loop counter is incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value of `int(input())`

After executing the code snippet:
- `p` is updated to a new list of even integers derived from the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of even integers derived from the new input, the loop counter is incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value of `int(input())`.**
