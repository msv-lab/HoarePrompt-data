Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of even integers derived from the new input.
- The loop counter is incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value of `int(input())`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `p`**: 
   - `p` is a list of even integers. This means every element in `p` is even, i.e., \( p[i] \% 2 == 0 \).

2. **Expression `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])`**:
   - This maps each element in the first three elements of `p` to a boolean value indicating whether the element is odd.
   - Since all elements in `p` are even, \( x \% 2 > 0 \) will always be `False`.
   - Therefore, `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))` will be `[False, False, False]`.

3. **Expression `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`**:
   - Summing a list of booleans treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0.
   - Therefore, `sum([False, False, False])` is 0.

4. **Expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`**:
   - This checks if the sum of the list of booleans is 3.
   - Since the sum is 0, this expression evaluates to `False`.

5. **Expression `sum(p) // 2`**:
   - This calculates the sum of all elements in `p` and then performs integer division by 2.
   - Since all elements in `p` are even, their sum will also be even, and dividing an even number by 2 will result in an integer.

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression is `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`.
   - We already determined that `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is `False`, which is equivalent to 0.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `0 + sum(p) // 2`, which is just `sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer result of `sum(p) // 2`.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
