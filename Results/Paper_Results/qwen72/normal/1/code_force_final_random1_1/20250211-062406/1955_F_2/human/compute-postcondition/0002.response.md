Let's break down the given code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of even integers derived from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Extract the first three elements of `p`:**
   ```python
   p[:3]
   ```
   This will give us the first three elements of the list `p`.

2. **Map the lambda function to check if each element is odd:**
   ```python
   map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])
   ```
   Since `p` is a list of even integers, each element in `p` is even, and thus `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False` for each element in `p[:3]`.

3. **Convert the map object to a list:**
   ```python
   list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))
   ```
   This will result in a list of `False` values because all elements in `p` are even.

4. **Sum the list of boolean values:**
   ```python
   sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))
   ```
   Since all values in the list are `False`, the sum will be `0`.

5. **Check if the sum is equal to 3:**
   ```python
   sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3
   ```
   Since the sum is `0`, this condition will be `False`.

6. **Convert the boolean result to an integer:**
   ```python
   (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)
   ```
   `False` is equivalent to `0` in integer form.

7. **Calculate the sum of all elements in `p` and divide by 2:**
   ```python
   sum(p) // 2
   ```
   This will give us the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

8. **Add the two results:**
   ```python
   (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2
   ```
   Since the first part is `0`, the final result will be `sum(p) // 2`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
