Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` which starts at 0. If the first three integers are equal and odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Then, for each integer in the test case, `cnt` is increased by the integer divided by 2 (using floor division). The function prints the value of `cnt` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
