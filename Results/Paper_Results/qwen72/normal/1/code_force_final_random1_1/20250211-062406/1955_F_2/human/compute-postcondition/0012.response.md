Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least three elements, `cnt` is now 1 + floor(x / 2) + floor(x / 2) + floor(x / 2), `x` is the third element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value.
- The initial value of `cnt` was either `1 + floor(x / 2) + floor(x / 2)` or `floor(x / 2) + floor(x / 2)`.
- After executing the code, `cnt` becomes `1 + floor(x / 2) + floor(x / 2) + floor(x / 2)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `p_i`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
