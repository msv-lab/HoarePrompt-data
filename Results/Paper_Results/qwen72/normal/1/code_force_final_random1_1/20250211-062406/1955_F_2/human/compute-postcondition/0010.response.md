The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the given context, it seems to operate under the assumption that it processes a series of test cases, each containing four integers (`p_i`), where each `p_i` is an integer within the range 0 to 200, inclusive. The total number of test cases, denoted as `t`, is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, inclusive.

Given this context, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `p_i` for each case. However, without further details on the specific output or logic, the exact return value cannot be precisely defined. 

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing four integers (`p_i`), where each `p_i` is an integer between 0 and 200. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The function returns a result based on the values of `p_i` for each test case.**
