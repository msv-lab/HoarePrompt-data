The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.

None of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
