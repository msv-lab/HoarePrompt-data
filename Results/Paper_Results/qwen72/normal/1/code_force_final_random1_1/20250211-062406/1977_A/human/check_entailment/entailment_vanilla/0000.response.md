Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Parsing Input**: For each test case, the program parses two integers `n` and `m` from the input. This is done correctly using list comprehension.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if n == m:` This checks if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif m > n:` This checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. If true, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif m == n - 1:` This checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is one less than the number of moves `n`. If true, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add one cube in each move except the last one.
   - **Condition 4**: `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` This checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If true, it prints 'Yes' because an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes.
   - **Condition 5**: `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` This checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. If true, it prints 'Yes' because an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.
   - **Else**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `m` is greater than `n` or when `m` and `n` have different parities correctly.

5. **Output**: The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
