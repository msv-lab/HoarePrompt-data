### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower.

#### Program Logic:
The program uses the following conditions to decide whether to print "Yes" or "No":
1. If `n == m`, print "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, print "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, print "Yes".
4. If both `n` and `m` are even, print "Yes".
5. If both `n` and `m` are odd, print "Yes".
6. Otherwise, print "No".

#### Evaluation of Conditions:
1. **If `n == m`:**
   - This is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired height, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.

2. **If `m > n`:**
   - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

3. **If `m == n - 1`:**
   - This is correct because Nikita can add one cube per move and then remove one cube at the end to achieve the desired height.

4. **If both `n` and `m` are even:**
   - This is correct because if both `n` and `m` are even, Nikita can alternate between adding and removing cubes to reach the desired height.

5. **If both `n` and `m` are odd:**
   - This is correct because if both `n` and `m` are odd, Nikita can also alternate between adding and removing cubes to reach the desired height.

6. **Otherwise, print "No":**
   - This is incorrect. The program fails to consider the possibility of reaching the desired height through a combination of adding and removing cubes when `n` and `m` do not satisfy the above conditions.

#### Example Case:
- **Input:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes`
- **Actual Output:** `No`

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "No" because it doesn't account for the possibility of reaching the desired height through a combination of adding and removing cubes. The correct logic should be that if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it is always possible to reach the desired height.

#### Corrected Condition:
To fix the program, we need to add a condition that checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even:
```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **accurate**. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically the case where the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
