Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, either `m` is not even or `n` is not even. If both `m` and `n` are odd, then the condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true. Otherwise, either `m` is even or `n` is even.***
