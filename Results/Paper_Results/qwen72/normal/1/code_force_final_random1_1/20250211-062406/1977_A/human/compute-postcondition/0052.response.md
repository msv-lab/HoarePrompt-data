Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) from the input. It then evaluates the relationship between `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the following conditions: if `n` equals `m`, or `m` equals `n - 1`, or both `n` and `m` are even, or both `n` and `m` are odd, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the values of `t`, `i` (which is `t - 1`), `n`, and `m` from the last test case. The function does not return any value. **
