Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and if both `m` and `n` are even, then both `m` and `n` are even numbers. If both `m` and `n` are odd, then the condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.***
