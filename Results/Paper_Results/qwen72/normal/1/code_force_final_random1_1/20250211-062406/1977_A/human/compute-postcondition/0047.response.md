Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `m` is the second integer from the new input. If `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `m` and `n` remain unchanged. If `m` does not equal `n - 1`, the values of `m` and `n` are maintained regardless of whether they are even or odd.***
