Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'Yes'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **Yes**
