Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is equal to `n - 1`.

### Analysis:
- From the conditions, we know that `m` is exactly one less than `n`. This means `m = n - 1`.
- The conditions `n` is not equal to `m` and `m` is less than or equal to `n` are satisfied by the relationship `m = n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
