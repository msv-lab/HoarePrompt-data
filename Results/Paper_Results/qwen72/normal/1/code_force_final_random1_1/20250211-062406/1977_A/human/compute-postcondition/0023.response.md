Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` == `m`, then `n` is equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `m`, and the following conditions hold: if `m` > `n`, then `m` is greater than `n`; if `m` <= `n`, then `m` is less than or equal to `n`; if `m` == `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`; if both `m` and `n` are even, then both `m` and `n` are even numbers; if both `m` and `n` are odd, then `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.***
