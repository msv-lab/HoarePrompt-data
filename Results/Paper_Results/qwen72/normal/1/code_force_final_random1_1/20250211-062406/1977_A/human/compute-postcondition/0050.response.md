Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the last input, and `m` is the second integer from the last input. The values of `n` and `m` will depend on the final input provided during the last iteration of the loop. If `n` == `m`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` > `n`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` <= `n`, and specifically if `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` does not equal `n - 1`, the values of `n` and `m` are maintained regardless of whether they are even or odd.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The values of `n` and `m` will reflect the last input provided during the final iteration of the loop, and the conditions checked within the loop (such as `n == m`, `m > n`, etc.) will have been evaluated for each pair of inputs. The final values of `n` and `m` will be based on the last input, and the loop will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each pair of inputs according to the conditions specified in the loop.
