Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given that `mex` is equal to `n` and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the last element of `res` (at index `i`) is updated to `n - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
