You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), where n is the length of both p and a, and a is constructed based on the MEX operation on p. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):

                mex = mex - ar[i]

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after all iterations. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar` of length `n`. It then computes a new list `res` of the same length, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, with `mex` initially set to `n` and updated during the computation. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where the MEX value needs to be updated correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating `mex` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `mex`**: The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation. This is incorrect because the MEX of an empty array is 0, not `n`.

2. **Updating `mex`**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than `mex`. This means `mex` is always updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which can lead to incorrect values.

3. **Handling MEX correctly**: The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence. The program does not correctly maintain this property. It should keep track of the smallest missing integer as the permutation is being constructed.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect permutation because it does not correctly update the MEX value.

To fix this, the program should use a set to keep track of the elements that have been used and correctly compute the MEX at each step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected version maintains a set of used elements and updates the MEX correctly, ensuring that the permutation is constructed as required.
