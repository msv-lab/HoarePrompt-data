Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`, the second-to-last element which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and the third-to-last element which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `res` list at index `i` (which is `len(ar) - 3`) with the value `mex - ar[i]`. After this update, the `res` list now has the third-to-last element set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it `len(ar) - 4`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
