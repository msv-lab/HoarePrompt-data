Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is now equal to `n - sum(ar)`. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- **`_`**: Remains 1.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer.
- **`ar`**: Remains the list of integers provided by the user input.
- **`res`**: After the loop completes, each element `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
- **`mex`**: After the loop completes, `mex` is updated to `n - sum(ar)`, where `sum(ar)` is the sum of all elements in the list `ar`.
- **`i`**: The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`, so after the loop completes, `i` is `-1`.
