Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` held true, and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]` was true, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]` and the condition no longer holds.***
