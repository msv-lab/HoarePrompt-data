The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from the current value of `mex`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element
- `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]` and the second-to-last element which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`
- `mex` is either `n` or `n - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex > mex - ar[i]` held true
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, the value of `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]` and the second-to-last element which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
