The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by the user input. The loop will execute based on the value of this range.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, indicating that the loop has run once. For the loop to execute one more time, the range must allow for another iteration. Since the loop iterates over `range(int(input()))`, the number of iterations is determined by the user input at the start of the loop. However, since the loop has already run once, the user input must have been at least 2 for the loop to run again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the user input must be at least 2, and `_` will increment to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is now equal to `n - sum(ar)`. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.**
