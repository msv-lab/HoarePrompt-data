Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s`. If `char` (the second character in the original `s`) is in `unique_chars`, `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j-1]` where `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at index 0 of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars` and the else part is executed, `s` remains unchanged, `unique_chars` has `char` inserted at index 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`.***
