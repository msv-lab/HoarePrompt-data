Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the list `unique_chars`. However, it does not correctly handle the replacement process. Specifically, the logic inside the loop is flawed because it modifies the string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The program incorrectly inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which is not part of the decoding algorithm. The `unique_chars` list should only contain the distinct characters from the input string `s`, and these characters should be used to perform the symmetric replacement.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**: The function returns `unique_chars` joined as a string, which is not the decoded string. The decoded string should be the result of replacing each character in the input string `b` with its symmetric counterpart from the `unique_chars` list.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
```

This corrected version:
- Constructs the `unique_chars` list containing all distinct characters from the input string `s` in sorted order.
- Creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
- Uses the mapping to decode the input string `s` by replacing each character with its corresponding value from the mapping.

This should correctly decode the string as per the problem description.
