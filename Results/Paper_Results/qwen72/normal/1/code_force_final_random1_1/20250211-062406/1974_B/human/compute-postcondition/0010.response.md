Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index `0`, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`, and `char` is not in `unique_chars` (except for the insertion).**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `len(unique_chars) - 1` to `len(unique_chars)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
