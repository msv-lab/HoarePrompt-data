Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index `0`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`, and `char` is not in `unique_chars` (except for the insertion).**

Explanation:
- The code `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` at the beginning of the list `unique_chars` (since `i` is 0).
- The list `unique_chars` now includes `char` at the first position, making the list one element longer.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `j` is updated to `len(unique_chars) - 1`, which is now one more than its previous value because `unique_chars` has one additional element.
- The string `s` and the condition that `char` is not in `unique_chars` (before the insertion) remain unchanged.
