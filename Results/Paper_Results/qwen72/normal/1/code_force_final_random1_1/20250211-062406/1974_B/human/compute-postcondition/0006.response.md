Output State: **`s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j-1]`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original string `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`, and `char` is in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is decremented by 1, changing from `len(unique_chars) - 1` to `len(unique_chars) - 2`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
