Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is 1, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`. If `suf[1] - smin[1]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.***
