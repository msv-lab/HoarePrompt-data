Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(t):
    b = input().split()
    n = int(b[0])
    k = int(b[1])
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    suf = []
    suf.append(0)
    for i in range(n):
        suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
    smin = [0]
    for i in range(n):
        if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
            smin.append(suf[i + 1])
        else:
            smin.append(smin[i])
    sm = -111
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
            sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
    sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
    sm += suf[n]
    if sm < 0:
        a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
        sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
    else:
        sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    print(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`. If `sm` (which is initially `2 + suf[n]`) is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `2 + suf[n] + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`. If `sm` (which is initially `suf[n] + 2`) is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + 2 + 1,000,000,007` and `a` is set to 0. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(suf[n] + 2) % 1,000,000,007`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. If `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (abs(sm) // 10 + 1) * 10`. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `sm % 10`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
