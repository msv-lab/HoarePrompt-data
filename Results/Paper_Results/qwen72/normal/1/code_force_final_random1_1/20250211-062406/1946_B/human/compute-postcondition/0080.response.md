Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 2, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is 2, `sm` is updated based on the condition described in the initial state. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated to `[0, suf[1], suf[2], suf[3]]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains `[0, 0, 0, smin[2]]`.***
