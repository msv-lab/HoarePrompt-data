The code snippet `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.
- If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0].

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. The value of `i` is 1.
2. The value of `smin[i]` is either `suf[1]` or 0, depending on the condition `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`.
3. The code appends `smin[i]` to the list `smin`.

Therefore, the new state of `smin` will be:

- If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` will be [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[1]`].
- Otherwise, `smin` will be [0, 0, 0].

The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `suf`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[1]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is [0, 0, 0].**
