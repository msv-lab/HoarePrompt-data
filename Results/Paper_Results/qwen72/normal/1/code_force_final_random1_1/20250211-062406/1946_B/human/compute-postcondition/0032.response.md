To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n + 1):
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `range(n + 1)` must generate at least one value, which means `n + 1` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `j` is 0
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace
- `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]
- `i` is n-1
- `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to n) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`
- `sm` is -111

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` in the loop head will start from 0 and go up to `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` must be at least 0
- `i` is 0 (as it will start from 0 in the loop)

All other variables and lists remain as they are, as they are not directly involved in the loop head.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` must be at least 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is 0, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to n) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is -111**
