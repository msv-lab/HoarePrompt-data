Postcondition: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index, `sm` is now `sm * 2 + suf[n]`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**
