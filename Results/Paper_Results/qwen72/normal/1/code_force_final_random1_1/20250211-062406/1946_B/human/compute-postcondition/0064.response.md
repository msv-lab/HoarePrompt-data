Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is now a list containing four elements `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]]`, `i` is 2, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is updated based on the condition described in the initial state.**
