The code snippet updates the value of `sm` to be the difference between the `i`-th element of `suf` and the `i`-th element of `smin`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` must be at least 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.
- `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index.
- If `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[0] - smin[0]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

The code snippet:
```python
sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
```
- This line sets `sm` to the value of `suf[1] - smin[1]`.

Since `i` is 1, the new value of `sm` is `suf[1] - smin[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index, `sm` is `suf[1] - smin[1]`.**
