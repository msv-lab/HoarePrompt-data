The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is 1, and `smin` is [0, `suf[i + 1]`] if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`. Otherwise, `smin` is [0, 0].**
