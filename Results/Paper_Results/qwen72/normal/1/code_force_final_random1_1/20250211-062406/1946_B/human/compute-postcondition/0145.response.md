Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`, inclusive.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
- The variable `sm` is updated during each iteration if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is still -111.
- By the end of the loop, `sm` will hold the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n`.
- The lists `suf` and `smin` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
