Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is updated based on the conditions described, and `a` is set to 0 if `sm` was originally less than 0.**
