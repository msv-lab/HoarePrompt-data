Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 2, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is 2, and `smin` is [0, `suf[i + 1]` if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` else `smin[i]`]. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin[i]` is updated to `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin[i]` remains unchanged.***
