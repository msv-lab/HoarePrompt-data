Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index, `sm` is -111, and the condition `(suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111)` is true.**
