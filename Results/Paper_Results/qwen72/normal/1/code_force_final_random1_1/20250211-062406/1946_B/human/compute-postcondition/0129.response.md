The code snippet `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.
- If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`].

After executing the code snippet, the value of `suf[i + 1]` (which is `suf[3]`) is appended to the list `smin`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.
- `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`, `suf[3]`] if `suf[3]` is not less than `smin[2]`.
- `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`, `suf[3]`] if `suf[3]` is less than `smin[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`, `suf[3]`] if `suf[3]` is not less than `smin[2]`, otherwise `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`, `suf[3]`].**
