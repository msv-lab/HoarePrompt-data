Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`].***
