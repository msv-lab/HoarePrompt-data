Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is equal to `t`, `b` is the last list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the last `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the last `b`, `l` is the last list of integers obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in the last `l`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in the last `suf`, and `sm` is the final computed value after applying the given operations, which is printed out. All other variables remain unchanged as they were before the loop started.**
