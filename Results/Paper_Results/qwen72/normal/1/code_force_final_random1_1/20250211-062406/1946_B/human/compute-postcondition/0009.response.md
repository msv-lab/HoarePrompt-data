Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0]], `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of the current element in `suf` (which is 0) and the first element in `l` to the list `suf`.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.
