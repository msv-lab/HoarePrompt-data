Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is 1, `smin` is [0, `suf[i + 1]` if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` else 0, `smin[i]`].**

Explanation:
- The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`.
- Initially, `smin` is [0, `suf[i + 1]` if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` else 0].
- After appending `smin[i]`, the list `smin` becomes [0, `suf[i + 1]` if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` else 0, `smin[i]`].
- All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `i`) remain unchanged.
