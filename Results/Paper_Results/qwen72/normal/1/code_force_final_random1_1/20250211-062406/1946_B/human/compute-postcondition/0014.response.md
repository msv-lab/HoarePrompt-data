Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]], `i` is n-1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `j` remains 0.
- The list `b` remains the same as it was initially, containing the strings from the user input split by whitespace.
- The variable `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `b`.
- The variable `k` remains the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- The list `l` remains the same as it was initially, containing the integers from the user input split by whitespace.
- The list `suf` now contains `n` elements, starting with 0 and each subsequent element being the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`.
- The loop index `i` reaches `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
