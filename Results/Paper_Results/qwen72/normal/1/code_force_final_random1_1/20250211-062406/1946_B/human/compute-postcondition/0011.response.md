Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]], `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `suf` being a list with two elements: `[0, 0 + l[0]]`.
- The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of `suf[1]` and `l[1]` to the list `suf`.
- Since `i` is 1, `suf[1]` is `0 + l[0]`, and `l[1]` is the second element of the list `l`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `suf` is `suf[1] + l[1]`, which is `0 + l[0] + l[1]`.
- The updated `suf` list is now `[0, 0 + l[0], 0 + l[0] + l[1]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
