Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 2, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing the elements [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]], `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of the third element in `suf` (which is `suf[2]`) and the third element in `l` (which is `l[2]`) to the list `suf`.
- Before the code execution, `suf` was [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]].
- After the code execution, `suf` becomes [0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]].
- All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.
