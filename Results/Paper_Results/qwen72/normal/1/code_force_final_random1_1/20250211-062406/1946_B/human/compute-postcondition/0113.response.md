Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `suf` is updated by appending `suf[1] + l[1]` to it.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is 1, the new element appended to `suf` is `suf[1] + l[1]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
