The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each part into an integer, storing the result in the list `l`.

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `j` remains 0.
- `b` remains a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `b`.
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- A new list `l` is created, which contains integers derived from the new user input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace.**
