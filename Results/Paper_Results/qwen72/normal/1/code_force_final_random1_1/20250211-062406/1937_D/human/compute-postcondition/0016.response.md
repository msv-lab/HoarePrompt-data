Output State: **If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[0]`, `A` is `[x, x + 1]`, and `x` is `x + 1`. If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists, and the code snippet will raise an error.**

Explanation:
- If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[0]`, `A` is initially `[x]`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
- The code `A.append(x)` appends the new value of `x` (which is `x + 1`) to the list `A`.
- Therefore, `A` becomes `[x, x + 1]`.
- The value of `x` remains `x + 1` after the append operation.
- If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists, and attempting to append to `A` will raise an error.
