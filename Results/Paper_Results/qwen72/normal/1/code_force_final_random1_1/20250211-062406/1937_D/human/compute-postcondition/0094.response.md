Output State: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `l` is not equal to 0. `a` is now equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and the conditions regarding `s`) remain unchanged.
