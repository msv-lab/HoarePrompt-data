Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[1, 2]` if `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>', and `idx_A` remains `[1]` if `s[1]` is not '>' and `s[0]` is '>'. `A` remains `[0]` if `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>', otherwise `A` is `[0, 1]` if `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>', and `A` remains unchanged as an empty list if `s[0]` and `s[1]` are not '>' and `len(idx_A) != 0`. If `s[2]` is not '>', `idx_A` and `A` remain unchanged from their previous states.***
