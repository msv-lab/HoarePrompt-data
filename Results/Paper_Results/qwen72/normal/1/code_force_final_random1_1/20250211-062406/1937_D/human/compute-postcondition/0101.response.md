To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 0.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'.
- `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Variables Involved in the Print Statement:
- `a`: This is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b`: This is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
- `i`: This is 0.

### Calculation:
1. **Value of `a`**:
   - `A[l - 1]` is the value of the list `A` at index `l - 1`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the value of the list `idx_A` at index `l - 1`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `a = A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.

2. **Value of `b`**:
   - `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b = b + idx_B[r] * l`.

3. **Expression in the Print Statement**:
   - The expression is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a * 2 = (A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2`
     - `b * 2 = (b + idx_B[r] * l) * 2`
     - `i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`

### Final Expression:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = (A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2 + (b + idx_B[r] * l) * 2 + 1`

### Simplified Output:
- The exact numerical value depends on the specific values of `A`, `idx_A`, `b`, and `idx_B`, but the structure of the output is clear.

### Final Output:
Output: **(A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2 + (b + idx_B[r] * l) * 2 + 1 (where A, idx_A, b, and idx_B are as defined in the initial state)**
