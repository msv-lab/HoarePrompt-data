Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It processes the input string `s` to precompute the movements and times for pinballs starting at each position, considering the inversion of directions after each move. The program handles the different scenarios for pinballs moving left or right and calculates the time until they leave the grid. The solution is designed to efficiently handle multiple test cases and large input sizes, adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
