The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. The function processes this string and returns a specific value based on the content of the string.

To determine the functionality, let's break down the possible outputs:

- The function might count the number of '<' and '>' characters.
- It could check for balanced pairs of '<>'.
- It might return a boolean indicating whether the string is valid in some context.

However, without the exact output logic, we can only generalize based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and returns a value based on the content of the string. The exact nature of the return value depends on the internal logic of the function, but it processes the string to determine some property or result related to the sequence of '<' and '>' characters.**
