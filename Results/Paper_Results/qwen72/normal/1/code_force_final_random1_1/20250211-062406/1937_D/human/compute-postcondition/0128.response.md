Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is not '>', which means `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- The code updates `a` using the formula `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, `idx_B`, `B`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
