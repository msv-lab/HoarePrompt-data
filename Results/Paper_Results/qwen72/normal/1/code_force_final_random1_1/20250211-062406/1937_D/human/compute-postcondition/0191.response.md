To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 2.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `n`: This is the same as `j`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 2.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]`: This is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`. Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1. In Python, indexing with -1 refers to the last element of the list. Therefore, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last element of `idx_A`.

2. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - `n - i`: This is `n - 2`.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This is `(2 - idx_A[-1]) * 2`.

3. **Combine the Results:**
   - The final expression is `n - 2 + (2 - idx_A[-1]) * 2`.

### Final Calculation:
- Let's denote the last element of `idx_A` as `last_idx_A`.
- The expression becomes: `n - 2 + (2 - last_idx_A) * 2`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `n - 2 + (2 - last_idx_A) * 2` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **n - 2 + (2 - last_idx_A) * 2 (where n is the value of n, and last_idx_A is the last element of idx_A)**
