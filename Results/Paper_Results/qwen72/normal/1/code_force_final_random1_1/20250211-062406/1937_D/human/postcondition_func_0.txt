The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a series of integers to the console, where each integer represents a specific value derived from the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the results to the console. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the string `s` remains unchanged, and the console contains the printed integers.
