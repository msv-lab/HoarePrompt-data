The code snippet `B.append(0)` adds a 0 to the list `B`. Given the initial state, `B` starts as `[0, 0]`. After appending 0, `B` becomes `[0, 0, 0]`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.**
