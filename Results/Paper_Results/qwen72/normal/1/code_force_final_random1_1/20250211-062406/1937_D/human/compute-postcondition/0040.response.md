Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`. If `idx_B` was initially empty, `B` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, if `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.***
