Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the string `s`). The list `idx_A` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '>' in the string `s`. The list `A` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '>' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty lists.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` will have reached the last index of the string `s`, which is `n-1`.
- The list `idx_A` will store the indices of every occurrence of the character '>' in the string `s`.
- The list `A` will store the results of the calculations performed each time a '>' character is encountered, using the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty.
