Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is 0, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `l` is 1, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.***
