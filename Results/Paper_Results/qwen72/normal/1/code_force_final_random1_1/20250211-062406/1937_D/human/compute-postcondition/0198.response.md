To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 2.
- `a` is equal to `B[r]`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **`a`**: This is the value of `B[r]`, where `r` is the length of `B` minus 2. So, `a` is the third-to-last element of the list `B`.

2. **`b`**: This is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1, which means `idx_A[-1]` would refer to the last element of `idx_A` if it were a valid index. However, since `idx_A` is not defined in the initial state, we need to assume it is a valid index. Let's denote the last element of `idx_A` as `idx_A_last`.

   Therefore, `b` is updated to:
   \[
   b = b + (i - \text{idx\_A\_last}) \times (r + 1)
   \]
   Given `i` is 2 and `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `r + 1` is the length of `B` minus 1.

3. **`n`**: This is the value of `j`, which is given as `n`.

4. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 2.

### Expression in the `print` Statement:
The expression to be printed is:
\[
a \times 2 + b \times 2 + (n - i)
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
a \times 2 + b \times 2 + (n - 2)
\]

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The final output will be:
\[
2a + 2b + (n - 2)
\]

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **2a + 2b + (n - 2) (where a is the third-to-last element of B, b is updated to b + (i - idx_A_last) * (r + 1), n is the value of j, and i is 2)**
