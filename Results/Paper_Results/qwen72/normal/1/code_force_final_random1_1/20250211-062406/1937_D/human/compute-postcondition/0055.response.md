The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial conditions:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is `n - 3`
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`.
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Additionally, if `len(idx_B) != 0`, `x` is 0.

Since `idx_B` already contains `[i]` (if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`), appending `i` again will add another `i` to the list. If the character at index `i` is not `<`, `idx_B` remains unchanged, and appending `i` will add `i` to the list.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is `n - 3`
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i, i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`.
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Additionally, if `len(idx_B) != 0`, `x` is 0.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i, i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`; if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. Additionally, if `len(idx_B) != 0`, `x` is 0.**
