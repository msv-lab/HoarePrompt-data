Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is the number of '>' characters in the string `s`, and `r` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: Remains equal to `n` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`idx_B` and `B`**: These lists are initialized before the loop and are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
- **`l`**: This variable counts the number of '>' characters encountered in the string `s`. Each time a '>' character is found, `l` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after the loop completes, `l` will be equal to the total number of '>' characters in `s`.
- **`r`**: This variable starts as the length of `B` and is decremented each time a '<' character is encountered. Since the loop iterates through the entire string `s`, `r` will eventually reach 0, assuming there are any '<' characters in `s`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
