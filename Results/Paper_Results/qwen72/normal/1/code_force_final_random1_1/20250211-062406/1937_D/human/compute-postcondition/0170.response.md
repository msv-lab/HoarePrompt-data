Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `j` being equal to `n`, `i` being 2, `idx_B` containing the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` containing the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- The code snippet updates the value of `a` using the formula `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- The values of `l` and `r` are not directly modified by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values: `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- The value of `b` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `B`) retain their initial values.
