Output State: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'. `a` is now equal to the first element of `A` (i.e., `A[0]`). `b` is now equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` updates the value of `b`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last element in the list `idx_B`, which contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `i` is 0, as specified in the initial state.
- `l` is 0, as specified in the initial state.
- Therefore, `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
