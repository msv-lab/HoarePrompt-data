Output State: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1`, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.**

Explanation: The code `r = len(B)` assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `r` is now the number of elements in the list `B`.
