Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2] - (idx_B[r - 2] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 1)`, `x` is `r - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated using the formula `b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
- The previous value of `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2]`.
- The value of `x` is `r - 2`.
- Therefore, the new value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2] - (idx_B[r - 2] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
