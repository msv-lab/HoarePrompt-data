Postcondition: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'. Additionally, `l` is not less than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, and `l - r > 0`. `a` is equal to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1]`.**
