Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists.***
