Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`. If `idx_B` was initially empty, `B` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, if `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 1`.
- The code `i = n - 1 - j` updates the value of `i` to `n - 2` because `j` is 1.
- The conditions regarding `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged unless the character at the new index `i` (which is now `n - 2`) in the string `s` is `<`. If the character at this new index is `<`, `idx_B` and `B` will be updated accordingly. If the character is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.
