Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `a` is `A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes the values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b`.
- The code snippet `b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` updates the value of `b`.
- Since `l` is 0, the term `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` evaluates to 0, so `b` remains unchanged as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the updated value of `b` as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
