Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is `r - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`.
- Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, the expression simplifies to `x = (length of B - 1) - 2`, which is `x = length of B - 3`.
- All other variables (`a`, `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
