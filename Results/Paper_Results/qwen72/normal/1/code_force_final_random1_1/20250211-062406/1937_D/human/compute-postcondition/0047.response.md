Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`.
- Initially, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]` if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<` and `idx_B` was initially empty.
- After appending `i` to `idx_B`, `idx_B` now contains `[i]`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 2`.
- The lists `B` and `idx_B` are updated, but the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition about the character at index `i` in the string `s` being `<` is assumed to be true based on the initial state, so `idx_B` and `B` are modified accordingly.
