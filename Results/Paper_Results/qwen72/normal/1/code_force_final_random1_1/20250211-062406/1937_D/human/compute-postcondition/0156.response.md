To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `a` is equal to `B[r]`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

### Explanation:
1. **`a`**: This is the last element of the list `B`, which contains values based on the positions of '<' in the string `s`.
2. **`b`**: This is a running total that is updated based on the formula `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Here, `idx_A` is not explicitly defined, but it is likely a typo and should be `idx_B`. The value of `b` depends on the current value of `i`, the previous index of '<' in `s`, and the length of `B`.
3. **`n` and `i`**: `n` is the total length of the string `s`, and `i` is the current position in the string, which is 1.
4. **`l`**: This is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not. Since `i` is 1, `l` will be 0 if `s[1]` is not '>', and 1 if `s[1]` is '>'.
5. **`r`**: This is the length of `B` minus 1, which means it is the index of the last element in `B`.

### Calculation:
- `a * 2`: This is twice the value of the last element in `B`.
- `b * 2`: This is twice the value of `b`.
- `(n - i)`: This is the difference between the total length of the string `s` and the current position `i`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Given the initial state, the precise values of `a`, `b`, and `n` depend on the specific values in `B` and the string `s`. However, we can describe the output in general terms:

Output: **(2 * B[r] + 2 * b + (n - 1))**

This is the final output, where:
- `B[r]` is the last element of the list `B`.
- `b` is the updated value of `b` based on the formula.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is 1.
