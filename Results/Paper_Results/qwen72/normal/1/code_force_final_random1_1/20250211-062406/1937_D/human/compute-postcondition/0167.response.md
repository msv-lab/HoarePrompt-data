Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` updates the value of `b`.
- `i` is 2, and `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, so `r - 1` is the last index of `B`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last element in `idx_B`, which is the index of the first occurrence of '<' in the string `s` when considering `idx_B` in descending order.
- Therefore, `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`, which simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1] - 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
