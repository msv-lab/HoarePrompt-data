Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`. If the length of the list `idx_B` is 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it.***
