Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. `x` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is 0, regardless of the condition.
- The code appends `x` to the list `B`.
- Since `x` is 0, the new value of `B` is `[0, 0, 0]`.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, `i`, `idx_B`) remain unchanged.
