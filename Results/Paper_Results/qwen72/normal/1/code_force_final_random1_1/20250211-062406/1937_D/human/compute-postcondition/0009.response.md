Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `A` is an empty list.
- The code appends `x` to `A`.
- After appending, `A` now contains one element, which is `x`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. Since `A` was initially empty, `A[len(A) - 1]` is 0 (as there were no elements before).
- Therefore, `x` is equal to `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
