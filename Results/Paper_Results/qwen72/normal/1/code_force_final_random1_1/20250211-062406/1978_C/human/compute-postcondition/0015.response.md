Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)` where `l` was modified from its initial state.** 

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to the result of `func_3(1, l)` before being returned. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, `i`) are also updated but do not affect the final return value of `l`.
