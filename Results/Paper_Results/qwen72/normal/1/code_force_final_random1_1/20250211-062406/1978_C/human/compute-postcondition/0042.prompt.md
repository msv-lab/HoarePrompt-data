You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains a positive integer, `i` is -1, `k` is 0, and `l` is a modified list where the elements have been rearranged according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, the last elements of the original list `l` have been moved to the beginning of the list, and the positions of these elements within the list may have been adjusted based on the value of `k` during each iteration. The final list `l` will not contain any elements that were originally at the end of the list in their original positions, and the value of `k` will be 0, indicating that the required number of rearrangements has been completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. It returns a modified list `l` based on specific conditions involving the insertion and removal of elements, particularly focusing on the position `-k` and the presence of the element `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `l`, but since `l` was not defined or modified in the given code snippet, its value is unknown.

Case_2: The program returns the list `l` which has the element `x` inserted at the position `-k`. The list `l` contains elements from its original state, plus the element `x` at the specified position.

Case_3: The program returns the list `l` which has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed, ensuring `x` is no longer the last element of `l`.

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` which has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed, and `x` is also inserted at the position `-k`. The value of `k` is such that `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is.

Case_5: The program returns the modified list `l` where `x` has been inserted at the beginning, the last two elements have been removed, and if `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element.

Case_6: The program returns the list `l` which now has `x` inserted at the beginning and at the position `-k`, and the last three elements removed. The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
