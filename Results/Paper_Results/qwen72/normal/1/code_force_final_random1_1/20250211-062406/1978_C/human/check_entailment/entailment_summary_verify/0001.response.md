### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, the program should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4:** This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value must be even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is greater than this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
     - **Correctness:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - **func_1:** This function attempts to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value `k`. It uses a greedy approach to swap elements to increase the Manhattan value.
     - **Correctness:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements. The logic for determining the number of swaps and the positions to swap is complex, but it seems to follow a structured approach. However, the correctness of this function depends on the specific implementation details.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps in the permutation list to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - **Correctness:** These functions perform the swaps as intended, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.
   - **func_5:** This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
     - **Correctness:** The function correctly prints the permutation.
   - **func_6:** This function orchestrates the entire process by calling the other functions in sequence.
     - **Correctness:** The function correctly handles the flow of the program.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **func_4:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct.
   - **func_1:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements. The logic for determining the number of swaps and the positions to swap is complex, but it seems to follow a structured approach. However, the correctness of this function depends on the specific implementation details.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform the swaps as intended, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.
   - **func_5:** The function correctly prints the permutation.
   - **func_6:** The function correctly handles the flow of the program.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is odd correctly by returning "No".
   - The program also handles the case where `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value correctly.
   - The construction of the permutation in `func_1` may not always produce a valid permutation for all valid inputs of `n` and `k`, particularly for larger values.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program has a logical structure and handles edge cases correctly.
   - However, the permutation construction in `func_1` may not always produce a valid permutation for all valid inputs of `n` and `k`, particularly for larger values.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program may not always produce a valid permutation for all valid inputs of `n` and `k`, particularly for larger values. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed for all test cases.
