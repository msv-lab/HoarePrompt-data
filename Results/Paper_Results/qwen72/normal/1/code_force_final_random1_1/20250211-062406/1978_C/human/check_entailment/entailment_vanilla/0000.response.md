### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4:** This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value must be even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is greater than this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
   - **func_1:** This function attempts to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value `k`. It uses a greedy approach to swap elements to increase the Manhattan value.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps in the permutation list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5:** This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - **func_6:** This function orchestrates the entire process by calling the other functions in sequence.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **func_4:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \( \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - **func_1:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements. However, the logic for determining the number of swaps and the positions to swap is complex and may not always produce the correct result, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is odd correctly by returning "No".
   - The program also handles the case where `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value correctly.
   - However, the construction of the permutation in `func_1` may not always produce a valid permutation for all valid inputs of `n` and `k`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program has a logical structure and handles edge cases correctly.
   - However, the permutation construction in `func_1` may not always produce a valid permutation for all valid inputs of `n` and `k`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program may not always produce a valid permutation for all valid inputs of `n` and `k`, particularly for larger values. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed for all test cases.
