Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 3, and `i` is `n - 4`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, the program does not return anything from the if-else block.***
