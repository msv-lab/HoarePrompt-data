You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
```
def func_1(n, k):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns `l`, but since `l` was not defined or modified in the given code snippet, its value is unknown.

Case_2: The program returns the list `l` which has the element `x` inserted at the position `-k`. The list `l` contains elements from its original state, plus the element `x` at the specified position.

Case_3: The program returns the list `l` which has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed, ensuring `x` is no longer the last element of `l`.

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` which has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed, and `x` is also inserted at the position `-k`. The value of `k` is such that `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is.

Case_5: The program returns the modified list `l` where `x` has been inserted at the beginning, the last two elements have been removed, and if `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element.

Case_6: The program returns the list `l` which now has `x` inserted at the beginning and at the position `-k`, and the last three elements removed. The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
