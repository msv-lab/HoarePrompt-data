The code snippet `x = l[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `l` to the variable `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `k` is `k - (n - 3) + 1`.
- The list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last two elements removed.
- If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element.
- If `1 + i` is greater than `k` and `k` is not 0, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`, and the last three elements are removed.
- The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position.

After executing the code snippet `x = l[-1]`:
- The variable `x` is now assigned the value of the last element of the list `l`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 3) + 1`, the list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last two elements removed. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element. If `1 + i` is greater than `k` and `k` is not 0, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`, and the last three elements are removed. The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position. `x` is the last element of the list `l`.**
