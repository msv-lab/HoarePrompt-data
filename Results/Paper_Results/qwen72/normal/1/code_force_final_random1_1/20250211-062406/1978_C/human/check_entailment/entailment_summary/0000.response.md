### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_4`)**:
   - `func_4` reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating an invalid input.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating an invalid input.
   - If `k` is valid, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates through the list, attempting to reduce `k` by swapping elements.
   - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current list `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, it calls `func_2` to perform a specific swap.
   - Otherwise, it continues modifying the list through calls to `func_3` and adjusting `k`.

3. **Swapping Elements (`func_2` and `func_3`)**:
   - `func_2` swaps elements at specific positions to achieve the desired reduction in `k`.
   - `func_3` performs another type of swap to adjust the list.

4. **Output (`func_5`)**:
   - `func_5` prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` if a valid permutation is found.
   - If no valid permutation is found, `func_6` prints "NO".

5. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - `func_6` orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print the result.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and checks for the validity of `k`.
- It generates a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value if possible.
- The output format matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
