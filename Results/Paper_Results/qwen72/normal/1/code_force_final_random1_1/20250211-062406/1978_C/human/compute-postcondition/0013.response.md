The function `func_4` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the described cases, it seems that the function might internally prompt the user for two values, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative even integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function then processes these values according to the following rules:

- Case_1: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_2: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_3: The function returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer provided by the user, and `k` is an even integer also provided by the user. Additionally, `max_k` is set to `n` (regardless of whether `n` is odd or even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the first two cases both result in returning (0, 0), and only one case is fulfilled, the third case must be the primary operational case when the conditions are met.

Functionality: **The function may prompt the user for two values, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative even integer. It returns (0, 0) in some cases. In another case, it returns the values of `n` and `k`, ensuring that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
