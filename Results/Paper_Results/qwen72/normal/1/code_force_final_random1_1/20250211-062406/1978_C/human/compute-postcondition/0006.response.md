To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

- `n` and `k` are integers with specific ranges.
- `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`.
- The code snippet calls `func_5(l)`.

Since the functions `func_1` and `func_5` are not defined in the provided context, we can only infer the following:

1. `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, which means `l` is some value derived from `n` and `k`.
2. `func_5(l)` is called, which means `func_5` is executed with `l` as its argument.

Without the definitions of `func_1` and `func_5`, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` or what `func_5` does. However, we can state that `func_5` has been called with `l` as its argument.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` has been called.**
