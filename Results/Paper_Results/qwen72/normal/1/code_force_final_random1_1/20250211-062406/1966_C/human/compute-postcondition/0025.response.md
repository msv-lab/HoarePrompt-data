The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust these.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. The loop iterates over the indices from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(arr)`. Therefore, `arr` must have at least 4 elements (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`).

Given that `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 2 elements, the updated state should reflect that `arr` now must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp` is `True` if `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 2 < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` was `False`, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is 3; `tc` is greater than 0; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 4 elements.**
