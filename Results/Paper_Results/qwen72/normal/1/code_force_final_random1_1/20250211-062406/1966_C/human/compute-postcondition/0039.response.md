The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `arr` must still have enough elements for the loop to continue, meaning `arr` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`dp` is `True`, `i` is 3, `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, and `arr` must have at least 4 elements.**
