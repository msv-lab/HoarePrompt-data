Output State: **`dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(input())`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, based on the new input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `arr` variable by reading a space-separated list of integers from the input, converting them to a set to remove duplicates, sorting them in descending order, and appending a `0` at the end.
- The initial state of `dp`, `i`, `tc`, and `n` remains unchanged.
- The new `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, based on the input provided.
- The length of `arr` is now updated to include the new elements plus the appended `0`.
- The condition for `dp` remains the same, checking if any difference between consecutive elements in the new `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1.
- The value of `i` is updated to `len(arr) - 1`, reflecting the new length of `arr`.
- The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, but it must remain greater than 0.
- The value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
