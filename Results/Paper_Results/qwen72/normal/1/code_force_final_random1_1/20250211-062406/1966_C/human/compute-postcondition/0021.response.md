To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is determined by the range `range(1, len(arr))`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, len(arr))` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(arr)`. If `len(arr)` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. **Current State**: 
   - `dp` is `True`
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`
   - `tc` is greater than 0
   - `n` is `len(arr) - 1`
   - `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input in descending order, followed by a `0`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`len(arr)` must be greater than 1**: For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
- **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from 1, as specified in the range.

### Final State:
- `dp` remains `True` (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is 1 (as it will start from 1 in the loop).
- `tc` remains greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` remains `len(arr) - 1` (not relevant to the loop head).
- `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

### State:
**`dp` is `True`, `i` is 1, `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 2 elements.**
