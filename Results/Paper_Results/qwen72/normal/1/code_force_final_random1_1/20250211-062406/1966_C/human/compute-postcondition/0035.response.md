To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

1. The loop iterates over `range(1, len(arr))`, meaning `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(arr)` must be greater than 1 (so that the range from 1 to `len(arr) - 1` is not empty).

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is `True` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1` (this is the initial value but will be reset by the loop)
- `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`

For the loop to execute:
- `arr` must have at least 2 elements (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`).
- `i` will be set to 1 by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`dp` is `True`, `i` is 1, `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements**
