Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0, `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
- Given `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]` and `arr[i + 1]` is `arr[2]`.
- The condition `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` is evaluated.
- If `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` is true, `dp` becomes `True`.
- If `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` is false, `dp` becomes `not True`, which is `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.
