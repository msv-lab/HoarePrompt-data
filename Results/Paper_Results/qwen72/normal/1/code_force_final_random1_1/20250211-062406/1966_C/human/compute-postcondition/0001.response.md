The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4. Since `tc` is already within a range that ensures it is greater than 0, no adjustment is necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
