Output State: **`dp` is `True` if `arr[3] - (arr[4] if 3 < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` was `False`, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is 3; `tc` is greater than 0; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0` and must have at least 4 elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`.
- Given `i` is 3, the condition checks if `arr[3] - (arr[4] if 3 < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` was `False`.
- If `3 < n`, the condition evaluates to `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1`. If `3 >= n`, the condition evaluates to `arr[3] - 0 > 1`.
- The new value of `dp` is determined by whether this condition is true or false, or if `dp` was already `False`.
- All other variables (`i`, `tc`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
