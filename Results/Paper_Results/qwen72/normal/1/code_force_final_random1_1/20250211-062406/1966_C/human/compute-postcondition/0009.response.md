The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` starting from 1 up to but not including the length of `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- If `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1`, then `dp` remains True.
- If `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, then `dp` becomes False.
- All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the loop condition must still be satisfied (i.e., `i` must be less than `len(arr)`).

Given that `i` was previously unchanged, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the new state is:

State: **`dp` is determined by the condition `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1`, `tc` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `len(arr)`**.
