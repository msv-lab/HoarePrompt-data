To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0
- `dp` is True

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- `t` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `tc` remains as an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0
- `dp` remains True
- `i` is 1

### State:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0, `dp` is True, `i` is 1**
