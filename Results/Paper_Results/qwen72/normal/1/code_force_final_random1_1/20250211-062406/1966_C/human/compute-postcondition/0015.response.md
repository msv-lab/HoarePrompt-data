Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `dp` will be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is 1 or less. Otherwise, `dp` will be `True`. The value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`, and the variables `tc`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged, except `tc` is now `tc - 1`.**
