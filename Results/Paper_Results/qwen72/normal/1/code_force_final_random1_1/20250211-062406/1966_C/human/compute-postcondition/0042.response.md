Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `dp` is `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) such that their difference is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, `dp` is `True`.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.

### Analysis:
1. **`arr`**: Since `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order followed by a `0`, it looks something like this: `[a, b, c, ..., 0]` where `a > b > c > ... > 0`.

2. **`dp`**: To determine the value of `dp`, we need to check if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) such that their difference is less than or equal to 1.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and contains unique integers, the difference between any two consecutive elements (excluding the last `0`) will always be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `dp` will be `True`.

3. **`i`**: `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in `arr`, which is `0`.

4. **`tc`**: `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0. This is a condition that affects the loop or the context in which this code is running, but it does not directly affect the value of `dp` or the output of the `print` statement.

5. **`n`**: `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the same as `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement checks the value of `dp`.
- If `dp` is `True`, it prints `'Alice'`.
- If `dp` is `False`, it also prints `'Alice'`.

Since `dp` is `True` based on the initial state, the `print` statement will always print `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
