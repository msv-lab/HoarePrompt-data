Output State: **`dp` is `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) such that their difference is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, `dp` is `True`. `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `dp` will be `False` if there is any pair of consecutive elements in the array `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) where the difference between them is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `dp` will remain `True`.
- The variable `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the second-to-last element in the array.
- The variable `tc` will be `tc - 1`, and it must still be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` will remain `len(arr) - 1`.
- The array `arr` will still be a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.
