Output State: **`dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tc` is greater than 0; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`; `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` starting from 1 up to `len(arr) - 1`.
- In each iteration, `dp` is updated based on whether the difference between the current element and the next element (or 0 if it's the last element) is greater than 1, or if `dp` was already `False`.
- After all iterations, `dp` will be `True` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) where the difference is greater than 1. Otherwise, `dp` will be `False`.
- The variable `i` will be `len(arr) - 1` after the loop completes.
- The variables `tc`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
