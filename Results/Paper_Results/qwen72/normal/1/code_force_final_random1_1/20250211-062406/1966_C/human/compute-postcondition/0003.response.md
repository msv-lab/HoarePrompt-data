The code snippet reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts them to a list of unique integers, sorts this list in descending order, and appends a 0 to the end. The resulting list is stored in the variable `arr`.

- The variable `arr` is now a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
- The values of `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0.**
