The code snippet modifies the `arr` list by first converting the input (which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers) into a list of unique integers, sorting this list in descending order, and then appending a `0` to the end of the list. This operation does not affect the values of `dp`, `i`, `tc`, or `n`.

Output State: **`dp` will be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is 1 or less. Otherwise, `dp` will be `True`. The value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is now a sorted list of unique integers from the input in descending order, followed by a `0`.**
