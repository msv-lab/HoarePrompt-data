The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of `i`. If `i` has more characters, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N` (which is 200001), and `j` is '2'. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is 200001, its string representation is "200001", which has 6 characters. After the last iteration, `j` was '2', which is the first character of "200001". For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next character in the string "200001".

Therefore, the next character after '2' is '0'.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j` plus 2, `i` is `N`, `j` is '0'**
