Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` set to the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1`, `i` is `N`, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`.** 

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` updates the value of `pd[i]` to be the sum of its current value (which is the sum of the digits of `i`) and the value of `pd[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `N`, which is 200001, `pd[200001]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[200000]` and the sum of the digits of 200001. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
