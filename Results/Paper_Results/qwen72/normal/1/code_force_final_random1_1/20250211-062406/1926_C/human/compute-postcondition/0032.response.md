The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate the number of iterations based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables and lists mentioned (`n`, `N`, `pd`, and `i`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given that the loop variable `_` is a placeholder, the key to ensuring the loop executes is the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
