Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of `j`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`.
- Since `i` is currently `N`, the value of `pd[N]` is updated to `pd[N] + int(j)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
