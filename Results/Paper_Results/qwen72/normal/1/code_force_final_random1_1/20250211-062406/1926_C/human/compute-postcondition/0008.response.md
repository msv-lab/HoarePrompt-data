Output State: **`num` is a positive integer with one more digit removed from the end, `a` is updated to `a + num % 10` (with the new value of `num`), and `num` must not be 0.** 

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding the last digit of the current value of `num` to it (`num % 10`). After this operation, `num` remains a positive integer with one more digit removed from the end, and it must still not be 0. The value of `a` is now `a + num % 10` with the new value of `num`.
