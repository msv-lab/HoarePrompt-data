The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of its original value by 10, effectively removing the last digit from `num`. Since `a` is the last digit of the original `num`, after this operation, `num` no longer includes `a`. The value of `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, with the last digit removed; `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
