To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `pd`**: The variable `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. This means we don't have any information about what `pd` contains. It could be a list, a dictionary, or any other data structure.
2. **Variable `n`**: `n` is an input integer. This means `n` can be any integer value, but it must be within the valid range for indexing `pd`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If `pd` is a list, `pd[n]` will access the element at index `n` of the list.
- If `pd` is a dictionary, `pd[n]` will access the value associated with the key `n`.
- If `pd` is not defined or does not contain a valid index/key `n`, this will result in an error (e.g., `IndexError` for lists or `KeyError` for dictionaries).

### Conclusion:
Since the initial state does not provide enough information about the contents of `pd`, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the value at index n in the list pd or the value associated with key n in the dictionary pd, assuming pd is defined and n is a valid index/key)**

If `pd` is not defined or `n` is not a valid index/key, the code will raise an error.
