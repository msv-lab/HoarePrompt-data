Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, and the loop has executed `t` times, printing the value of `pd[n]` for each input `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` must be at least 1, as the loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration of the loop, an integer `n` is read from the input.
- The value of `pd[n]` is printed for each input `n`.
- After the loop completes all `t` iterations, the state of the program reflects that the loop has executed `t` times, and the values of `pd[n]` have been printed for each input `n`.
