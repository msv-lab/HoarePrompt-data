To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the characters of the string representation of `i`.
   - The variable `j` will take on each character of `str(i)`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `str(i)` is not an empty string.
   - For `str(i)` to be non-empty, `i` must be a positive integer (since `i` is an integer).

3. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is `N`, which is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list of length 200001 with specific values.
   - `pd[N]` is the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is already set to 200001, which is a positive integer, `str(i)` will not be empty.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is a positive integer, which it is.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is already a positive integer (200001), no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state before the loop is already sufficient to ensure the loop runs.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` set to the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1`, `i` is `N`, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`**.
