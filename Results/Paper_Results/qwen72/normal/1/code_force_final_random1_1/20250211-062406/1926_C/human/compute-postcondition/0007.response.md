The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer with one more digit removed from the end, and `num` must not be 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0).

State: **`num` is a positive integer with one more digit removed from the end, `a` is updated to `a + num % 10` (with the new value of `num`), and `num` must not be 0**
