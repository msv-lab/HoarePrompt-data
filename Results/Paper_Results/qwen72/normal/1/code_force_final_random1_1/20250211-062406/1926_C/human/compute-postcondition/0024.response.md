The loop head involves the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be a non-negative integer, and converting `i` to a string should result in a non-empty string. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `N`, which is 200001. This value is valid and will convert to a non-empty string.

However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `i` is indeed a valid integer that can be converted to a string. Since `i` is already set to `N` (200001), this condition is met. The variable `j` will take on each character of the string representation of `i` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `i` or `j` for the loop to execute. The state remains as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`**
