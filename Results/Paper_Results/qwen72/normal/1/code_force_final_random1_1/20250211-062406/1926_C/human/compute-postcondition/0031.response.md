Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to 200000, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. The loop variable `i` is 200001, indicating the loop has completed its execution.**

Explanation:
- The initial state sets `pd` as a list of zeros of length 200001.
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 200000`.
- In each iteration, `pd[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.
- After the loop completes, `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented to 200001, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
