Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the next character `j` in `str(i)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of the next character `j` in the string representation of `i`.
- Since `i` is currently `N`, and `N` is 200001, the next character `j` in `str(i)` (which is "200001") is "2".
- Therefore, `pd[i]` (which is `pd[200001]`) is incremented by 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0
- `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]` plus 2
- `i` is `N`
- `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus 2
