The given code snippet updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of the character `j` to it. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0.
- `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`.
- `i` is `N`.
- `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the next character `j` in `str(i)`.
- `j` is '0'.

The code snippet:
```python
pd[i] += int(j)
```

Impact of the code:
- `pd[i]` is incremented by the integer value of `j`.
- Since `j` is '0', `int(j)` is 0.
- Therefore, `pd[i]` remains unchanged.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`, `i`, `j`) remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`, `pd[i]` is unchanged, `j` is '0'.**
