To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its nature from the context.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`**: This variable is mentioned but not directly used in the `print` statement. It only needs to be at least 1, which doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is an input integer. The value of `n` will determine the index used to access the `pd` list.
3. **List `pd`**: This list is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Without knowing the contents of `pd`, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we can describe it in terms of the list and the index `n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(pd[n])` statement will print the element at index `n` of the list `pd`. Since the exact contents of `pd` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list and the index.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd is the list and n is the input integer)**
