Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j` plus 2 plus the integer value of `j`, `i` is `N`, `j` is '0'.**

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`.
- Given that `j` is '0', `int(j)` evaluates to 0.
- Therefore, `pd[i]` is incremented by 0, which means its value remains unchanged.
- The initial value of `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) was the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j` plus 2.
- After executing the code, `pd[i]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j` plus 2 plus the integer value of `j` (which is 0).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes and retains the initial conditions for all other variables.
