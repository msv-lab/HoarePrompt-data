Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` contains the elements it had before. For each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `n-1`), if the difference between the current element and the previous element is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`. Additionally, the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.**
