Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer, each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` contains the elements it had before. For each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `n-1`), if the difference between the current element and the previous element is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the results of `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After the loop has executed all its iterations, `array2` will contain the values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) will retain their original values as they were before the loop started. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
