Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 3, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input. If the difference between the fourth element of `arr` and the third element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, `array2` is a list containing the result of `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` along with its previous elements. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.***
