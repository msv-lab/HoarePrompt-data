The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer, each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
