To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` must be greater than `n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
- `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0.
- `f` is the second element of `feat`.
- `a` is the third element of `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.
- `array2` is an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range is from 1 to `n-1`).
- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and should start at 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `t` remains as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` must be greater than `n`.
- `i` is 1 (initial value for the loop).
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
- `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is the second element of `feat`.
- `a` is the third element of `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.
- `array2` is an empty list.

### Final State in Text Format:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is an empty list**
