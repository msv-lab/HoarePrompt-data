Based on the initial state provided:

- `array2` contains the values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) retain their original values as they were before the loop started.
- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

Given this information, the `print('Yes')` statement will simply print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
