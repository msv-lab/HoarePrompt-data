Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m` at which messages need to be sent. For each test case, it determines whether the phone can successfully send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge required to send all messages is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate responses have been printed. **
