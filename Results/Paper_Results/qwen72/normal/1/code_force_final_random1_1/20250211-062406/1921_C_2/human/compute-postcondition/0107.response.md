Postcondition: **`array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i` is 0 and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is appended to `array2`. For any other index `i`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`. The final state of `array2` will contain all such values that meet these conditions. The other variables `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Additionally, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
