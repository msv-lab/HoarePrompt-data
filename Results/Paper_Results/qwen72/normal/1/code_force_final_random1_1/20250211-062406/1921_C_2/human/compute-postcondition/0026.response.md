The provided Python code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `feat`. This impacts the values of `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` as they are derived from the elements of `feat`.

Let's break down the changes:

1. **`feat`**: The new value of `feat` is a list of integers read from the input.
2. **`n`**: The value of `n` is updated to the first element of the new `feat` list.
3. **`f`**: The value of `f` is updated to the second element of the new `feat` list.
4. **`a`**: The value of `a` is updated to the third element of the new `feat` list.
5. **`b`**: The value of `b` is updated to the last element of the new `feat` list.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `arr`, `array2`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` contains the elements it had before.**
