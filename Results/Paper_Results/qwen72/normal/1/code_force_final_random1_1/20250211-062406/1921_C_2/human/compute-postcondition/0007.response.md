The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, storing these integers in the list `arr`.

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
- `n` is the first element of `feat`.
- `f` is the second element of `feat`.
- `a` is the third element of `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
