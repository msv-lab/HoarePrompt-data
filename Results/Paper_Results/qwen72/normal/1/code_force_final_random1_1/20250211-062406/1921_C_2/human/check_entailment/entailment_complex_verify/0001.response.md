### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
   - It also reads the list of moments `arr` when messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for intervals where the phone cannot be turned off and on.
   - It iterates through the list of moments `arr` and checks if the interval between consecutive messages is less than `b / a`. If it is, it calculates the charge consumption for that interval and appends it to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The function calculates the total charge consumption for intervals where the phone cannot be turned off and on by summing the elements in `array2`.
   - It also calculates the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on for the remaining intervals.
   - Finally, it checks if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumption is less than `f`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues:
- **Case Sensitivity:** The problem description mentions that the output can be in any case (e.g., "YES", "yes", "Yes"). However, the function always prints "Yes" in lowercase. This should be corrected to ensure the output matches the problem requirements.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle edge cases where `n` is 1. In such cases, the loop `for i in range(1, n)` will not run, and `array2` will be empty. This could lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == 1:
            if arr[0] * a <= f:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
            continue
        
        array2 = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        total_charge_needed = sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b
        if total_charge_needed <= f:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Evaluation:
- **Original Code:**
  - The original code does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
  - The output is always in lowercase, which does not fully comply with the problem's requirement that the output can be in any case.

- **Corrected Code:**
  - The corrected code handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
  - The output is now in uppercase, which complies with the problem's requirement.

### Final Answer:
- **Original Code:** Final: **False**
- **Corrected Code:** Final: **True**
