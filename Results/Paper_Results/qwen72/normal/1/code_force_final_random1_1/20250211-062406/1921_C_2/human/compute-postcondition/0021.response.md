To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
     - `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0.
     - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
     - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
     - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `array2` contains the elements it had before.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `n-1`):
     - If the difference between the current element and the previous element is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Conditions to Check:**
   - The code will print 'Yes' if the conditions described in the initial state are met.

Given the conditions:
- The code checks if the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.
- If this condition is true, the code will print 'Yes'.

Since the initial state explicitly states that the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
