Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the results of `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**

Explanation:
- The code `feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `feat`.
- The initial state specifies that `feat` is a list of integers, and the first element of `feat` is `n`, which must be greater than 0.
- The second element of `feat` is `f`, the third element is `a`, and the last element is `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `array2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The conditions related to `array2` and the sum of its elements plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` compared to `f` remain as specified in the initial state.
