The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default factory of `int`, the default value for any key not explicitly set is 0. Therefore, `d2[i + 1]` is 0 unless it has been explicitly set to another value. Since `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `i` is `n - 2`, `d2[i + 1]` (which is `d2[n - 1]`) is 1. Thus, `d2[i]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is 2, and the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
