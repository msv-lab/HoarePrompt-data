You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    0 8 12 15 20

    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        d1[2] = 1
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        m = int(input())
        for j in range(m):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities positioned on a number line and a series of queries about distances between specific pairs of cities. It calculates and prints the minimum travel distance between the specified cities for each query. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program state with the last processed test case's data in memory, including the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the last query pair.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - There are two types of moves:
     - Move to the closest city for 1 coin.
     - Move to any other city for the distance between the two cities in coins.
   - The closest city for each city is unique and determined by the smallest distance to another city.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum cost to travel from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively.
   - `d1` is built from left to right, and `d2` is built from right to left.

3. **Building `d1`:**
   - `d1[2] = 1` initializes the cost to move from the second city to the first city.
   - For each city `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, update `d1[i + 2]` to be 1 more than `d1[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, update `d1[i + 2]` to be the distance to the next city plus `d1[i + 1]`.

4. **Building `d2`:**
   - `d2[n - 1] = 1` initializes the cost to move from the last city to the second-to-last city.
   - For each city `i` from `n-2` to 1:
     - If the distance to the previous city is less than the distance to the next city, update `d2[i]` to be 1 more than `d2[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, update `d2[i]` to be the distance to the previous city plus `d2[i + 1]`.

5. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`:
     - If `y > x`, the cost is `d1[y] - d1[x]`.
     - If `y < x`, the cost is `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given limits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the given rules. The approach of building `d1` and `d2` ensures that the minimum cost is calculated efficiently for each query.
