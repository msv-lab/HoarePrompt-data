To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `x` and `y` are the new pair of integers provided by the user input.
   - `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.
   - If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d2`:**
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, which means any key that does not exist in `d2` will return 0.
   - `d2` contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.

3. **Evaluating `d2[y] - d2[x]`:**
   - `d2[y]` will return the value associated with the key `y` in `d2`. If `y` is not a key in `d2`, it will return 0.
   - `d2[x]` will return the value associated with the key `x` in `d2`. If `x` is not a key in `d2`, it will return 0.
   - The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will subtract the value of `d2[x]` from the value of `d2[y]`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `y == n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `x == n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If neither `y` nor `x` is `n - 1`, both `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 0.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `x == n - 1` and `y != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If neither `y` nor `x` is `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

Given the above scenarios, the output will depend on the values of `y` and `x` relative to `n - 1`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n - 1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n - 1, otherwise 0)**
