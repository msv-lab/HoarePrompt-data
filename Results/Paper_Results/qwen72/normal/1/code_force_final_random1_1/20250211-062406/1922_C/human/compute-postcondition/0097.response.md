Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are the new pair of integers provided by the user input, and the current value of `y` is greater than `x`.**
