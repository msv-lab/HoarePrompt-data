The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new integer input provided by the user. This new value of `n` replaces the previous value which was equal to `t`. The new value of `n` must be greater than 2 as specified in the precondition. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input. If the last `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If the last `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.**
