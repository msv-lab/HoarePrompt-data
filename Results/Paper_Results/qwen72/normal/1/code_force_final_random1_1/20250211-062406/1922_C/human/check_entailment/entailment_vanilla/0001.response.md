### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the queries and processes them.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city.
   - The function initializes an array `prog_cities` to store the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program creates prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` for the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - These arrays are used to efficiently compute the total cost of traveling from one city to another.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (from `a` to `b`).
   - It then uses the appropriate prefix sum array to compute the total cost of the travel.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the boundary conditions. Specifically, when `i == 0` or `i == n-1`, it should handle these cases differently.
  - The function also incorrectly sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 when the distance to the next city is smaller. Instead, it should set it to the actual distance if the next city is the closest.

- **Reversing the Cities:**
  - The program reverses the cities to compute the backward prefix sums. However, the function `func_1` is called with the reversed cities, which might lead to incorrect results if the function is not designed to handle reversed input.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum arrays are calculated correctly, but the logic in `func_1` needs to be fixed to ensure the correct values are stored in `prog_cities`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly in the `func_1` function, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
