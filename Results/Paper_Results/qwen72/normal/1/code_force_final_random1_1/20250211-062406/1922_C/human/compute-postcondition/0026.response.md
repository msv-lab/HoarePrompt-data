Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, and the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
