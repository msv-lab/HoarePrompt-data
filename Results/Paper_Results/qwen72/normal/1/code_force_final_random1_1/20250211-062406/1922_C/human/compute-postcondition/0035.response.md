Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[n - 4]` is 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.***
