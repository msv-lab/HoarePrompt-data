Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1. For each index `k` from 3 to `n - 1`, if `l[k] - l[k - 1] < l[k - 1] - l[k - 2]`, then `d1[k + 1]` is `1 + d1[k]`. Otherwise, `d1[k + 1]` is `l[k] - l[k - 1] + d1[k]`. `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input. If the last `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If the last `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `d2[n - 1] = 1` sets the value of `d2[n - 1]` to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
