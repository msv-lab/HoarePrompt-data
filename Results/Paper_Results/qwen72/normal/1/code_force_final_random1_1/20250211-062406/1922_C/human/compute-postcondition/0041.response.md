Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(d1[y] - d1[x])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, meaning any key that hasn't been set will return 0.
   - We know that `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are provided by the user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is any other value, `d1[x]` will be 0 because it hasn't been explicitly set.
   - If `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is any other value, `d1[y]` will be 0 because it hasn't been explicitly set.

5. **Calculation:**
   - The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will depend on the values of `x` and `y`:
     - If `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
     - If `x` is 2 and `y` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
     - If `x` is not 2 and `y` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
     - If `x` is not 2 and `y` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be one of the following based on the values of `x` and `y`:
     - 0 if both `x` and `y` are not 2.
     - 1 if `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2.
     - -1 if `x` is 2 and `y` is not 2.
     - 0 if both `x` and `y` are 2.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[2] is 1 and d1[key] is 0 for any key not explicitly set to 1)**
