Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is 2, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`. Additionally, the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the value of `d1[3]` because `i` is 1.
- Since `d1[2]` is 1 (as given in the initial state), `d1[3]` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
