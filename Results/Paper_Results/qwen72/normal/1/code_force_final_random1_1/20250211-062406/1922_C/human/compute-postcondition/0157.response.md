To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, with `y` being less than or equal to `x`.
   - `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with the default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.

2. **Understanding `d2`:**
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, meaning any key that is accessed but not present in the dictionary will return 0.
   - `d2` contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.

3. **Values of `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Evaluating `d2[y] - d2[x]`:**
   - If `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1 because `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - If `y` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0 because `d2` will return the default value of 0 for any key that is not `n - 1`.
   - Similarly, if `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 0.

5. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will both be 0, so `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be 0.
   - If `y` is equal to `n - 1` and `x` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1 and `d2[x]` will be 0, so `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is equal to `n - 1` and `y` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0 and `d2[x]` will be 1, so `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be -1.
   - If both `x` and `y` are equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will both be 1, so `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be 0.

Given the constraints that `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the most likely scenario is that either `y` or `x` (or both) could be `n - 1`. However, without specific values for `x` and `y`, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions.

Output: **0 or 1 or -1 (depending on whether `x` and `y` are equal to `n - 1`)**
