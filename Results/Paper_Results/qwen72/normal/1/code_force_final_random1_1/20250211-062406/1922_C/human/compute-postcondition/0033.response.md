The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 4`, the new value of `d2[n - 4]` is `1 + d2[n - 3]`. Since `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, `d2[n - 3]` defaults to 0 if it hasn't been set before. Therefore, `d2[n - 4]` becomes `1 + 0`, which is 1. However, since `d2[n - 1]` is already set to 1, `d2[n - 3]` would also be 1 if `n - 3` is within the range of the keys. Thus, `d2[n - 4]` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 4]` is 2.**
