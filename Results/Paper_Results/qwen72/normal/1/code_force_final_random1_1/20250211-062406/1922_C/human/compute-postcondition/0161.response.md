To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input.
   - `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.
   - `x` and `y` are now updated to the new pair of integers provided by the user input.
   - If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d1`:**
   - `d1` is a dictionary that contains keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by some loop logic. Since the exact loop logic is not provided, we assume that `d1` is populated with some values for each key from 2 to `n`.

3. **Understanding `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input, and they are updated to a new pair of integers provided by the user input.
   - If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Given the initial state and the provided information, the output of the print statement depends on the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. Since the exact values of `d1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the values in `d1`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values in the dictionary d1 corresponding to the keys y and x, respectively)**
