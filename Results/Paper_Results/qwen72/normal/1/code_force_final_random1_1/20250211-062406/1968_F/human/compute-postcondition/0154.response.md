Output State: **All initial conditions remain unchanged, except that `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx-2]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `results` now includes the string 'YES'. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
