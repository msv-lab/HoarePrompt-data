Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 5, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2]}`, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially increased by 4, and now it is further increased by 1, making the total increase 5.
- The value of `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` because `idx` has been increased by 1.
- The values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` are updated based on the new `idx` value, which is `idx - 3`, `idx - 2`, and `idx - 1` respectively.
- All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
