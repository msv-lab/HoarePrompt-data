Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2]}`, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list associated with the key `pf[2]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Since `pf[2]` was already a key in `mp` with an empty list, appending `i` (which is 2) results in `mp[pf[2]]` being `[2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
