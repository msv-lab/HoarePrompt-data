Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), and the last element of `results` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), the last element of `results` is an empty string, `i` is 1, and `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[idx - 3])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 3])` and `pf[2]` being `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, and now `mp[pf[2]]` contains `[2]`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 3])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]` and must be at least 3, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 5`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[idx - 4])`, `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 4])`, `pf[2]` being `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, and `pf[3]` being `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, and now `mp[pf[2]]` contains `[2]`. If `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` contains an empty list. `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is 3, and `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 4])`. `mp[pf[3]]` now contains `[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
