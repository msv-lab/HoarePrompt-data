Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), the last element of `results` is an empty string, `i` is 1.**
