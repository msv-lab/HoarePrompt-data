Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include the key `pf[1]` with an empty list as its value, and `pf[i]` is not in `mp`. `i` remains 1, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, and `mp[pf[1]]` now contains `[1]`.**
