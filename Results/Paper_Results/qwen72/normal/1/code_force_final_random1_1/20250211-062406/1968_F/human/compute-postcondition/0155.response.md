Postcondition: ***`l` is the integer value of `data[idx-2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, and `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES', and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
