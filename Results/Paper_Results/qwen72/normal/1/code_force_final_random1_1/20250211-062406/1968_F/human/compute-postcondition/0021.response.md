Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])` and `a[2]` which is set to `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}` and `mp[pf[1]]` now contains `[1]`, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `a[2]` to `int(data[idx])`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
