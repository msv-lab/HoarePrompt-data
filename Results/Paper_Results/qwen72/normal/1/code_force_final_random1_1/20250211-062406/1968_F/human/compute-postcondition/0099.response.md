Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), the last element of `results` is an empty string, `i` is 1, and `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list associated with the key `pf[1]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Since `i` is 1, the list associated with the key `pf[1]` in `mp` is updated to `[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
