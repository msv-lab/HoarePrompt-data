Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 3])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.**

Explanation:
- The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2.
- This affects the subsequent calculations involving `idx`, specifically:
  - `n` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`.
  - `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
  - `idx` is now increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 3` instead of `q * (n + 2) + n + 1`.
  - The elements of `a` are now `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 3])` instead of `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`.
  - `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`.
  - `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
