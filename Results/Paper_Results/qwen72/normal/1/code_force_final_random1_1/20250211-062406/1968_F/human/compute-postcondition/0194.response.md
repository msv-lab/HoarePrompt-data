Output State: **After the loop completes all iterations, `mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has run `n` times. The array `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`. The array `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index. The variable `idx` will be equal to `n`, as it was incremented by 1 for each iteration. All other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.**
