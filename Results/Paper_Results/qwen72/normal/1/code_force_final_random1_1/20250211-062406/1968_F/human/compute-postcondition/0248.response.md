Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, and a list of integers `a`. It reads input data sequentially, where each test case involves calculating the XOR of subarrays and checking specific conditions based on the results. For each query, the function determines whether a certain condition related to the XOR of the subarray is met, appending 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, with each result on a new line, followed by an extra newline. The function modifies the input data by consuming it and updates internal state variables but does not return any value. **
