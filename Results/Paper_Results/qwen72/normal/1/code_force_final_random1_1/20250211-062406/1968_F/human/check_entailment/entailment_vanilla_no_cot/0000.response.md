Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases. The program calculates prefix XORs and uses a map to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero or if there exist indices within the query range that have the same prefix XOR values, which would allow the subarray to be divided into parts with equal XOR values, fulfilling the condition for the subarray to be "interesting." The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures efficient checking of these conditions. The program's structure and logic align with the requirements and constraints of the problem.
