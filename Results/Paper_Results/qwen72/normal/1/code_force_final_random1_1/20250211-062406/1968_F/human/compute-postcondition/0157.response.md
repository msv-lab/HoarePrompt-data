Output State: **`l` is the integer value of `data[idx-4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx-3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. If `x` is 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES', and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
