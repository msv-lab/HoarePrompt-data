Output State: **All the initial conditions remain unchanged, except that the loop continues to the next iteration. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately and the loop to proceed to the next iteration. This means that all the variables and their values remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed, except for the loop counter `_`, which is incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `q`.
