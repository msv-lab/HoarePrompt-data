Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2.** 

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, while the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, except that their references to `data` are now based on the updated `idx`.
