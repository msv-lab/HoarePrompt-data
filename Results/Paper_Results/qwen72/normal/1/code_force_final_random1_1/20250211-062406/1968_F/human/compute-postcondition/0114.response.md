Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, and `i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is determined by the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` after the loop completes.
- **`q`**: The value of `q` is determined by the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]` after the loop completes.
- **`idx`**: After the loop completes, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 1`.
- **`a`**: The list `a` is filled with values from `data` starting from `idx - (n + 2) * q - n` to `idx - (n + 2) * q - 1`.
- **`pf`**: The list `pf` is updated with the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- **`mp`**: The dictionary `mp` contains keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values.
- **`results`**: Contains the final results of the loop's operations, with the last element being an empty string.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` is equal to `n`.
