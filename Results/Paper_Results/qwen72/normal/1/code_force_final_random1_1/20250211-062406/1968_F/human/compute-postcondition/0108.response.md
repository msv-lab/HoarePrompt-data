Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 3, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, and `a[3]` which is `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, with `pf[1]` being `int(data[idx - 3])` and `pf[2]` being `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}`, and now `mp[pf[2]]` contains `[2]`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `int(data[idx - 3])`.**
