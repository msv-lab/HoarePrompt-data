Output State: **`l` is the integer value of `data[idx-4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx-3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. If `x` is 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES', and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- `l` remains the integer value of `data[idx-4]` because `idx` was already increased by 2 before this code snippet.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[idx-3]` for the same reason.
- `idx` is increased by 2, maintaining its updated value.
- `x` remains the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, which means `v1` is either the list associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`.
- If `x` is 0, `results` now includes the string 'YES', and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. This part of the state remains unchanged.
