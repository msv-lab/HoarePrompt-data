Output State: **All initial conditions remain unchanged, except that `v1` is now the value associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list `[]` if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`. Additionally, `v2` is now the value associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list `[]` if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, or the length of `v1` if no such element exists. `it2` is the index just before the first element in `v2` that is greater than or equal to `r`, or -1 if no such element exists. The `results` list now includes the string 'YES' as its last element.**
