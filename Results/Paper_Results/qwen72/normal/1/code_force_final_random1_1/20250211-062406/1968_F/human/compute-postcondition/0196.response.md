Output State: **`mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index, `idx` will be equal to `n`, `t`, `q` must be greater than 0, `data`, `results`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2` remain unchanged, `l` is equal to `int(data[n])`.**
