Output State: **`mp` is updated to `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[1]` is set to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, all other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pf[i]` (which is `pf[1]`) is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` (which is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`).
- All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
