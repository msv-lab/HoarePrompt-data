Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1.
- Initially, `idx` was increased by 2, so now it is increased by a total of 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
