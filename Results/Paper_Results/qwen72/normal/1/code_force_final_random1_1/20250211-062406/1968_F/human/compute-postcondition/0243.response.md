Output State: **After the loop completes all iterations, `mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has run `n` times. The array `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`. The array `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index. The variable `idx` will be equal to `n + 2 * q`, as it was incremented by 2 for each iteration. The variable `q` will be equal to 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `results` will contain a list of strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each query. All other variables (`t`, `data`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.**
