Postcondition: ***`mp` is updated to `{(0): [0]}`. If `pf[1]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is further updated to `{(0): [0], pf[1]: []}`. `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[1]` is set to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, and all other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.***
