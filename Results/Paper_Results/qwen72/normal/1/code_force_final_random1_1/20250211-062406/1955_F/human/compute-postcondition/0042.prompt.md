Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200 representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers) plus the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`, `x` is the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `x` is the last element of `a`, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is 1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a), otherwise `cnt` is sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
