The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200`) and converts them to even numbers by subtracting their modulo 2 value. It then calculates and prints a value for each test case, which is the sum of the following: 1 if the first three integers are all odd (which they cannot be after conversion to even), and half the sum of the converted even integers. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the state is that `t` lines of output have been printed, each corresponding to a test case.
