You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the four integers p_i in each test case is an integer where 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `p` is a list of even integers derived from the final input. The loop has executed `t` times, and the loop counter is equal to `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we are given the counts of each of these numbers.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that is set to 1 is even.
   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have the following binary representations:
     - 1: `0001`
     - 2: `0010`
     - 3: `0011`
     - 4: `0100`
   - The XOR of these numbers can be simplified by considering their parity (odd or even counts).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func` processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then applies a transformation to each count: `int(x) - int(x) % 2`, which effectively rounds down to the nearest even number.
   - The sum of these transformed counts is divided by 2, which gives the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to keep the XOR zero.
   - Additionally, it checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, which would add one more win for Bob.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Transformation:** `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`
     - This converts each count to the nearest even number.
   - **Sum of Pairs:** `sum(p) // 2`
     - This calculates the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to keep the XOR zero.
   - **Additional Check:** `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`
     - This checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, which would add one more win for Bob.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The transformation ensures that we are only considering even counts, which helps in maintaining the XOR zero.
   - The additional check ensures that if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd, Bob gets one more win.
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
