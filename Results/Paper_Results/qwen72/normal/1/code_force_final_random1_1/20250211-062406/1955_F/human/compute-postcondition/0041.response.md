To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `x` is the last element of `a`.
   - If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is \(1 + \sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - Otherwise, `cnt` is \(\sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Determine the Value of `cnt`:**
   - First, check if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd.
     - If they are, then `cnt` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\).
     - If they are not, then `cnt` is calculated as \(\sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - For each element `x` in the list `a`, compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - Sum these values to get the total sum.
   - If the first three elements are equal and odd, add 1 to this sum.

4. **Print the Result:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will depend on the specific values in the list `a`. However, we can describe the output in a general form:

- If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, the output will be:
  \[
  1 + \sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor
  \]
- Otherwise, the output will be:
  \[
  \sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor
  \]

Therefore, the final output can be described as:

Output: **cnt (where cnt is 1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a) if the first three elements of a are equal and odd, otherwise cnt is sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a))**
