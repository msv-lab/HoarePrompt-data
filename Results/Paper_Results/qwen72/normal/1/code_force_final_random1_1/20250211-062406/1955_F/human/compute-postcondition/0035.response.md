The value of `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is the first element of `a`, and `cnt` was initially 1 if the first three elements of `a` were equal and odd, or 0 otherwise, the new value of `cnt` will be `1 + math.floor(x / 2)` if the condition was met, or `math.floor(x / 2)` if it was not. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `a`, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2), otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2)**.
