Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers) plus the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`.
- The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations. After executing the code, `a` now contains the integers from the input.
- The variable `cnt` is defined based on the conditions given in the initial state. It remains unchanged by the code snippet provided.
- The values of `t` and `p_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` and maintains the initial conditions for `t`, `p_i`, and `cnt`.
