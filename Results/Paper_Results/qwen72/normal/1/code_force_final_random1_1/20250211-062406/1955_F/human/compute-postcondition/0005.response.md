Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of even integers derived from the current input.
- The loop counter is incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value of `int(input())`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `p`**:
   - `p` is a list of even integers. This means every element in `p` is divisible by 2, i.e., \(x \% 2 = 0\) for all \(x\) in `p`.

2. **Expression `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])`**:
   - This expression applies the lambda function `lambda x: x % 2 > 0` to the first three elements of `p`.
   - Since all elements in `p` are even, \(x \% 2 = 0\) for all \(x\) in `p`.
   - Therefore, `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False` for all elements in `p`.
   - The result of `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` will be a list of `False` values.

3. **Expression `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`**:
   - Converting the map result to a list gives `[False, False, False]`.
   - Summing this list (where `False` is treated as 0) results in `0`.

4. **Expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`**:
   - This checks if the sum of the list is equal to 3.
   - Since the sum is 0, the condition `(0 == 3)` is `False`.
   - The boolean `False` is treated as 0 in arithmetic operations.

5. **Expression `sum(p) // 2`**:
   - This calculates the sum of all elements in `p` and then performs integer division by 2.
   - Let's denote the sum of all elements in `p` as `S`.
   - The result of `sum(p) // 2` is `S // 2`.

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression is `0 + S // 2`, which simplifies to `S // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the integer division of the sum of all elements in the list `p` by 2.

Output: **S // 2 (where S is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
