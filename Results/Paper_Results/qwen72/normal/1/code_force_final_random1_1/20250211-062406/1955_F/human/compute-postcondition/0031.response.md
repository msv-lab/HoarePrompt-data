Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0, overriding its previous value which was `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`. The other variables (`t`, `p_i`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `cnt` while keeping the other variables in their initial state.
