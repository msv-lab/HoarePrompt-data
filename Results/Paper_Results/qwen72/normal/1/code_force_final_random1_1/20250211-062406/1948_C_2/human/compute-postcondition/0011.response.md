### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - `_` is 0.
  - `n` must be greater than 3.
  - `a` is a string input by the user.
  - `b` is a string input by the user.
  - `i` is 3.

- **Print Statement**:
  - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions specified in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'No'`.

### Output:
Output: **No**
