Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the condition checks if the robot encounters two consecutive '<' arrows in certain positions, but this does not fully capture all the scenarios where the robot might get stuck or fail to reach the target cell.

A counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  >><<
  >>><
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  No
  ```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) by following the path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Follow the arrow to (1, 3)
4. Move down to (2, 3)
5. Follow the arrow to (2, 4)

However, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it fails to consider all possible paths the robot can take. The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is too restrictive and does not cover all valid scenarios.
