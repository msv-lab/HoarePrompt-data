The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if it's possible to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 2-row grid, where each cell contains an arrow pointing left ('<') or right ('>'). The function prints 'No' if it finds any conflicting arrows that prevent such a path, and 'Yes' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
