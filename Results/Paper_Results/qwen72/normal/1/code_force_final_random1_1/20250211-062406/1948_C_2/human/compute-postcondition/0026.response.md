Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and either (i + 1 < n and the character at position i in `a` is '<', and the character at position i + 1 in `b` is '<') or (the character at position i in `a` is '<', and the character at position i - 1 in `b` is '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
