### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell `(1, 1)` and must reach cell `(2, n)`.
   - The robot makes two moves per second: one move in a direction (left, right, up, or down), followed by a move in the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by `n` columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot can only move within the grid.
   - The robot must reach the last column of the second row `(2, n)`.
   - The robot's movement is influenced by the arrows in the cells.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n`, the first row `a`, and the second row `b`.
   - It then iterates through the grid in steps of 2, checking specific conditions:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` or if `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`, it prints 'No' and breaks the loop.
   - If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'yes'.

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop where it keeps moving left in both rows.
   - The condition `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` checks if the robot can get stuck in a similar loop but involving the previous column.
   - These conditions are designed to detect scenarios where the robot might get stuck in a loop and unable to reach `(2, n)`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `print('No')` and `print('yes')` which should be consistent with the problem statement (e.g., `YES` and `NO`). However, this is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the logic.
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot can reach `(2, n)` without getting stuck in a loop. However, the conditions provided are sufficient to detect the most common scenarios where the robot gets stuck.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The logic of the program is designed to detect specific conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching `(2, n)`.
   - The conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are indeed sufficient to determine if the robot can get stuck in a loop.
   - The program correctly identifies scenarios where the robot cannot reach `(2, n)` and prints 'No' in those cases.
   - If none of these conditions are met, the program prints 'yes', which is correct because it implies that the robot can reach `(2, n)` without getting stuck in a loop.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct because it correctly checks the conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell `(2, n)`. The minor issue with the output format (using 'No' and 'yes' instead of 'NO' and 'YES') does not affect the correctness of the logic.

Final: **True**
