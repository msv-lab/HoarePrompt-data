- The logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly check all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not fully capture the conditions required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

Correctness:
