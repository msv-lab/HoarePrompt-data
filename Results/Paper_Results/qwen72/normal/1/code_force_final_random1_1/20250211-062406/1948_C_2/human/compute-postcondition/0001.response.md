The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the range function that depends on `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, as it represents the number of test cases. The initial state provided ensures that `t` is within the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which means the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Since the loop iterates `t` times, and the initial state already specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user within the valid range, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, for clarity, we can explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (the loop counter starts from 0)**
