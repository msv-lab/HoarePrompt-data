You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last integer input by the user, `a` is the last string input by the user, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'. If the loop broke due to the condition being met, the program printed 'No' and moved on to the next test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2-row grid, and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the directions of arrows in each cell of the grid. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result indicates whether it's possible to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid following the arrow directions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
