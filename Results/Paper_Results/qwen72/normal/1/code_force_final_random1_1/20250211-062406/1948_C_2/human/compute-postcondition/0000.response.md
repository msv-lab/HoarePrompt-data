Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
