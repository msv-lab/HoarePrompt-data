Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the provided program. The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is indeed too restrictive and does not accurately determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The program checks if there are two consecutive '<' arrows in specific positions, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, in the provided counterexample:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```
The robot can actually reach (2, 4) by following the path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Follow the arrow to (1, 3)
4. Move down to (2, 3)
5. Follow the arrow to (2, 4)

However, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it fails to consider all possible paths the robot can take. The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as simulating the robot's movements or using a different algorithm to check all possible paths.

Given the logical error identified in the original assessment, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
