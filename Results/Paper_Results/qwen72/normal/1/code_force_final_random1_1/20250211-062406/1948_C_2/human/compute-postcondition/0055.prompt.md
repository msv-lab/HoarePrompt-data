Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program prints 'yes' after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking if no conditions were met to break out of the loop. If any condition was met (i.e., `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`), the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is the new string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, and the final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
