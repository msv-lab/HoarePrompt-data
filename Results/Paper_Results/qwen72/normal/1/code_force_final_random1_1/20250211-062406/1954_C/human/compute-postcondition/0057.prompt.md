Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `x`, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `i` is 0, `new` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `x`, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, except the first element which is now `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, and the first element of `new2` is `min(a[0], b[0])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `x`, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, except the first element which is now `max(a[0], b[0])` and the second element which is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, and the first element of `new2` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element of `new2` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, and `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `x`, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `i` is 3, `new` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, except the first element which is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element which is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and the third element which is `a[2]` (or `b[2]`), `new2` is a list of `None` values with length equal to `len(a)`, the first element of `new2` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element of `new2` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, and the third element of `new2` is `min(a[2], b[2])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
