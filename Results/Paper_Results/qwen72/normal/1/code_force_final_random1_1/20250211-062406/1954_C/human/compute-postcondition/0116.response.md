Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string.
- `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string such that `b[i] == a[i]` for all `i` where \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(a)\).
- `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where each element `new[i]` is set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where each element `new2[i]` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `i` is now equal to `len(a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `b`**: Both lists `a` and `b` are identical because `b[i] == a[i]` for all `i` where \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(a)\).

2. **List `new2`**: Each element `new2[i]` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `new2[i]` will always be equal to `a[i]`.

3. **Print Statement**: The code snippet `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))` will convert each integer in `new2` to a string and join them together into a single string.

### Conclusion:
Since `new2` is identical to `a` (because `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same for all `i`), the output of the print statement will be the string representation of the digits in `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the string representation of the digits in `a`**

For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be:
Output: **12345**
