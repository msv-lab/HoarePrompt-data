Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9.** 

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, list(input())))` reads a new input string, converts each character of the input string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new list `b` is derived from the input string and consists of integers from 1 to 9.
