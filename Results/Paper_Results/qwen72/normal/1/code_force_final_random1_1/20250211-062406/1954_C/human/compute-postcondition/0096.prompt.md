Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The list `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string. The list `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string. The list `new` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`. The list `new2` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`. The variable `i` is set to 0.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The list `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string. The list `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string such that `b[0] == a[0]`. The list `new` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except `new[0]` which is set to the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`. The list `new2` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except `new2[0]` which is set to the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`. The variable `i` is now 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The list `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string. The list `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string such that `b[0] == a[0]` and `b[1] == a[1]`. The list `new` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except `new[0]` which is set to the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `new[1]` which is set to the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. The list `new2` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except `new2[0]` which is set to the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `new2[1]` which is set to the minimum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. The variable `i` is now 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The list `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string. The list `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string such that `b[0] == a[0]` and `b[1] == a[1]`. The list `new` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except `new[0]` which is set to the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new[1]` which is set to the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `new[2]` which is set to the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The list `new2` is now a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except `new2[0]` which is set to the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new2[1]` which is set to the minimum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `new2[2]` which is set to the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The variable `i` is now 3, and `len(a) > 2` and `a[2] == b[2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
