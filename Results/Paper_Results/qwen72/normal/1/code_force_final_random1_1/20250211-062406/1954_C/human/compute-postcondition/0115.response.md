Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string.
- `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string such that `b[i] == a[i]` for all `i` where \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(a)\).
- `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where each element `new[i]` is set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where each element `new2[i]` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `i` is now equal to `len(a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a` and `b`:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element corresponds to a digit from a new input string.
   - Since `b[i] == a[i]` for all `i`, the lists `a` and `b` are identical.

2. **Constructing `new`:**
   - `new` is a list where each element `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are identical, `a[i] == b[i]` for all `i`.
   - Therefore, `new[i] = min(a[i], b[i]) = a[i]`.

3. **Constructing the Output:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `new` to a string and joins them together into a single string.
   - Since `new` is identical to `a`, the output will be the string representation of the digits in `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the string representation of the digits in the list `a`.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in a) (where a is the list of integers corresponding to the digits of the new input string)**
