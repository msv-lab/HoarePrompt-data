Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The variable `i` will be equal to the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]`, or it will be equal to `len(a)` if all elements in `a` and `b` are equal up to the length of `a`. The list `new` will contain the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The list `new2` will contain the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`.**
