To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9.
- `i` is an index that can be any valid index up to the length of `a` or `b`.

### Construction of `new` and `new2`:
- If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where the first `i` elements are `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`.
- If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))` will join the elements of `new` into a single string, converting each element to a string first.

### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `i` is not equal to `len(a)`**
   - `new` will have the first `i` elements as the maximum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
   - The remaining elements of `new` will be `None`.
   - When joining these elements, the `None` values will be converted to the string `'None'`, but since the `join` method concatenates only the string representations of the elements, the `None` values will be ignored in the final string.

2. **Case 2: `i` is equal to `len(a)`**
   - `new` will have all elements as the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
   - There will be no `None` values in `new`.

### Final Output:
- If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the output will be a string consisting of the first `i` maximum values from `a` and `b`.
- If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the output will be a string consisting of the minimum values from `a` and `b`.

### Example:
- Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]`.
- If `i = 2`, then `new = [4, 5, None]` and the output will be `'45'`.
- If `i = 3`, then `new = [1, 2, 3]` and the output will be `'123'`.

### General Output:
- The output will be a string of digits, where each digit is either the maximum or minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, depending on the value of `i`.

Output: **a string of digits where each digit is the maximum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, or the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` if `i` is equal to `len(a)`**.
