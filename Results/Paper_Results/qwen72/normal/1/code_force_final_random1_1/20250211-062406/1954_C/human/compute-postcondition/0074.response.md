Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a` (or `b`, since they are of the same length), indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The list `new` contains the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and there are no `None` values left. The list `new2` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and there are no `None` values left.**
