### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the given problem. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues while \(i \times i \leq n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) and increments `i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.

#### Issues with the Code:
- **Incorrect Logic in `func_15`**:
  - The loop and the calculation inside `func_15` do not correspond to the problem's requirements. The loop iterates based on a condition involving \(i\) and \(n\), but it does not check the pairs \((a, b)\) or the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The calculation \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) is not related to the problem's constraints.

- **Missing Pair Checking**:
  - The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
  - It does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  - It does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. Computing the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
