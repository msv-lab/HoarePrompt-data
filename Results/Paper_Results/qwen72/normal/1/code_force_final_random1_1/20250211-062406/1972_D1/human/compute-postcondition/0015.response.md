Functionality: ** The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns a value based on a specific formula involving the smallest integer `i` greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \). The returned value is `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \). After the function concludes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function returns the computed value. **
