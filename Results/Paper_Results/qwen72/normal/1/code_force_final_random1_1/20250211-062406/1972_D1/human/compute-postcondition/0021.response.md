Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()) and all elements corresponding to `di - 1` in `d[da]` are reset to 0, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()) with `rank[da - 1]` updated to `tmp + 1`, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, and `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
- `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.
- After the loop, `processing[di - 1]` is reset to 0 for each `di` in `d[da]` that was processed.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
