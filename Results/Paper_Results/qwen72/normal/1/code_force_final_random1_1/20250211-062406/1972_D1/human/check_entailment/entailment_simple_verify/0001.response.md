Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the core logic in `func_15` does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the analysis further to ensure the conclusion is accurate:

1. **Input Handling Functions**:
   - These functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input. They are not directly related to the core logic but are necessary for handling the input format.

2. **Core Logic Function**:
   - `func_15` is the main function that attempts to solve the problem. Here is the function again for reference:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - **Input Reading**: `(n, m) = func_7()` correctly reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - **Loop and Calculation**:
     - The loop `while i * i <= n + i` iterates over possible values of \(i\).
     - The calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current loop and calculation do not address this condition.
     - The final `return ans - 1` is also arbitrary and does not align with the problem statement.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case:
     ```python
     def func_16():
         for _ in range(func_10()):
             sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
     ```

### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`:
- **Condition Check**: The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be expressed as:
  \[
  a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))
  \]
  for some integer \(k\).
- **Current Implementation**: The current implementation in `func_15` does not check this condition. Instead, it performs a loop and a calculation that does not relate to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness Check:
- The core logic in `func_15` is incorrect because it does not implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The loop and the calculation inside `func_15` are not aligned with the mathematical requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` is incorrect and does not follow the required conditions.

Final: **False**
