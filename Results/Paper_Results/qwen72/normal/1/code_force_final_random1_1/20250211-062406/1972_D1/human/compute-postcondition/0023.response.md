The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`.

- `d` is a dictionary where the keys are integers and the values are lists of integers.
- `processing` is a list of integers with a length of at least the maximum value of the keys in `d`.
- `da` is an integer key that is present in the dictionary `d`.
- `rank` is a list of integers with a length of at least the maximum value of the keys in `d`.

The function has two possible return cases:

- **Case_1:** The function returns 1.
- **Case_2:** The function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of recursively calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da` (a key in `d`), and a list `rank`. It returns 1 in one case, and in another case, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for each element in `d[da]` where the corresponding element in `processing` was initially 0.**
