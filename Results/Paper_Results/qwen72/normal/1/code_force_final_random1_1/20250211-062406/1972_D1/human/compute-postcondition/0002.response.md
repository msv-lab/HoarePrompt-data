To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.
- Loop statement:
  ```python
  for _ in range(func_10()):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.
3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.
   - The result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The loop iterates over a range generated by `func_10()`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.
- Since `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the loop condition, no adjustment is needed for `_`.

### Adjusted State:
- The only state that needs to be considered is the return value of `func_10()`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
