Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It executes a loop that runs `func_10()` times, where in each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` to the console. After the function completes, the console will contain the output of `func_15()` printed `func_10()` times, each on a new line. **
