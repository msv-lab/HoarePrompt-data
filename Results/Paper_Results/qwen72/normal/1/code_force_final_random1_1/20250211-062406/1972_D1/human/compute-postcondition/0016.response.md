Functionality: ** The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies `k` based on the elements of `a` and returns a value indicating whether `k` is non-negative or negative after the adjustments. **
