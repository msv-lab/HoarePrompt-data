To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the condition in the `while` loop head: `i * i <= n + i`.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is `(n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)`

We need to check if the condition `i * i <= n + i` holds true for the next iteration.

1. Calculate the left side of the inequality:
   - `i * i` = 3 * 3 = 9

2. Calculate the right side of the inequality:
   - `n + i` = n + 3

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `9 <= n + 3` must be true. Simplifying this:
- `9 <= n + 3`
- `6 <= n`

Since `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, the condition `6 <= n` is always true as long as `n` is at least 6. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

The state remains the same:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 3, `ans` is `(n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)`**
