Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \), and `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as \( i^2 \leq n + i \).
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
- The loop stops when \( i \) becomes the smallest integer such that \( i^2 > n + i \).
- Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the smallest integer greater than 1 that satisfies \( i^2 > n + i \).
- The final value of `ans` will be the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).
