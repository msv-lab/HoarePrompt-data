Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, and the length of the list `d[da]` is not equal to 1. The variable `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. After the loop, `processing[di - 1]` is reset to 0 for each `di` in `d[da]` that was processed.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function updates the `rank` list and returns an integer value. If the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by the `processing` list), updating the `rank` list and returning the minimum value found plus 1. The `processing` list is used to track which elements have been processed during the recursion, and it is reset after each recursive call.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that at least one of them is not zero.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns (1, 0, a), where 'a' is a non-negative integer and at least one of 'a' or 'b' is not zero, but 'b' is currently 0.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that at least one of them is not zero, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)` where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with at least one of them being non-zero, and `b` is not equal to 0. The expression `a // b` represents the integer division of `a` by `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where at least one of them is not zero. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are coefficients satisfying the equation `a*x + b*y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the values using the Euclidean algorithm. After the function concludes, the final state is that the GCD of `a` and `b` is computed, and the coefficients `x` and `y` are determined such that the linear combination of `a` and `b` equals the GCD.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer representing the length of a, m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of `a`, `m` is a positive integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of `a`, `m` is a positive integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies `k` based on the elements of `a` and returns a value indicating whether `k` is non-negative or negative after the adjustments.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \), and `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \), and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns a value based on a specific formula involving the smallest integer `i` greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \). The returned value is `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \). After the function concludes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function returns the computed value.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided to the function `func_16`.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times, printing the result of `func_15()` to the console on each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It executes a loop that runs `func_10()` times, where in each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` to the console. After the function completes, the console will contain the output of `func_15()` printed `func_10()` times, each on a new line.
