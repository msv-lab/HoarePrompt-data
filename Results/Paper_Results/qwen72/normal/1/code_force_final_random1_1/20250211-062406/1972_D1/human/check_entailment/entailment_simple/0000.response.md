### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`. This function correctly reads an integer from standard input. For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to compute the result and prints it.

2. **Function `func_15`**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which correctly reads and splits the input into integers.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues while \( i^2 \leq n + i \). Inside the loop, it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and increments `i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is complex, but the loop in `func_15` seems to be attempting to count valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `i` and updating `ans` accordingly.
   - However, the logic inside the loop does not directly address the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it seems to be counting something else, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The loop in `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to count pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is not being checked or counted correctly.
   - The loop and the final return value do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
