The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input, splits the line into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller receives a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
