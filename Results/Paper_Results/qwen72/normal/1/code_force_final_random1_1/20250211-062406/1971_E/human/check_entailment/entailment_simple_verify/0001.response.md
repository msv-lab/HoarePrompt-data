### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the positions and times of the known points, respectively.
   - It initializes `ad` and `bd` to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The program calculates the differences `ad` and `bd` for each segment between known points. This is done correctly by iterating through the lists `a` and `b` and computing the differences.

3. **Calculating Speeds:**
   - The program calculates the speeds `v` for each segment between known points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`. However, the variable `v` is not used in the subsequent calculations, which suggests that it might be unnecessary or a leftover from a previous version of the code.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it reads the value `ql` (the distance to check).
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. This is an efficient way to determine the segment in which the query point lies.
   - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, it directly prints `b[s]` because the car has already reached this point. This is correct.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance `ql` after subtracting `a[s-1]` and adds the time taken to reach `a[s-1]` (`b[s-1]`).
   - It then calculates the additional time required to travel the remaining distance using the speed `bd[s] / ad[s]` and prints the total time, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Analysis:
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching for the appropriate segment.
- The calculation of the remaining distance and the additional time required to travel that distance is logically sound and follows the problem's requirements.
- The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the query point matches a known point.

### Potential Issues:
- The variable `v` is calculated but not used in the subsequent calculations. This suggests that it might be unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.
- The variable `i` is initialized but not used in the code, which is also unnecessary.

### Conclusion:
Despite the presence of unused variables, the core logic of the program is correct and follows the problem's requirements. The program efficiently handles the queries and produces the correct output.

**Final: **True**
