To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `l` is 1
- `q` is greater than 1
- `m` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `ql` is an input integer
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`

### Context:
- If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
- The condition `a[s] == ql` implies that `ql` is found at index `s` in the list `a`.
- The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

### Output:
- Since `s` is the index where `ql` is found in the list `a`, the element at index `s` in the list `b` will be printed.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element at index s in the list b, and s is the index where ql is found in the list a)**
