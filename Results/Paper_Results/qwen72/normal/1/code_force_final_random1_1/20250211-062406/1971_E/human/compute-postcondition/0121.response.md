To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `l` is 1.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is initially `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`.

2. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`ql`**: This is the value after subtracting `a[s - 1]` from the initial `ql`.
- **`s`**: This is the index where the updated `ql` fits in the sorted list `a`.
- **`m`**: This is the result of the formula `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `bd`, and `ad` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and their relationships.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], with s being the index where ql fits in the sorted list a, and ql is updated to ql - a[s - 1])**
