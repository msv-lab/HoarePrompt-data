To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps leading to the execution of this statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, with `q` being greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, and it must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1.
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input.
   - `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
   - `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one.
   - `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `ql` is the new value provided by the user input minus `a[s-1]`.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.

2. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.
   - This means `a[s]` is the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(b[s], end=' ')` will print the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

Given the initial state and the steps to determine `s`, the output will be the value of `b[s]`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- User inputs for `n`, `k`, and `q`: `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `q = 2`.
- User inputs for `a`: `a = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.
- User inputs for `b`: `b = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- User input for `ql`: `ql = 4`.

1. **Calculate `s`:**
   - `ql = 4 - a[s-1]` where `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than 4.
   - The first element in `a` that is not less than 4 is `a[2] = 3` (index 2).
   - Therefore, `s = 2`.

2. **Print `b[s]`:**
   - `b[s]` is `b[2]`.
   - `b[2]` is 4.

### Final Output:
Output: **4**
