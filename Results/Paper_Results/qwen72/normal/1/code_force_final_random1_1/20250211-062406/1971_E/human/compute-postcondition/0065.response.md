Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, with `q` being greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `l` is 2, `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.** 

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding the product of `bd[s]` and `(ql - a[s - 1])` divided by `ad[s]` to the original value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
