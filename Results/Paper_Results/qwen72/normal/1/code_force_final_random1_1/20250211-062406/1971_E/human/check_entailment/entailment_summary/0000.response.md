Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Preprocessing**: The program preprocesses the lists `a` and `b` to create lists `ad` and `bd`, which store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively. This helps in calculating the speed between each pair of consecutive points.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query `d`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the query point lies. If the query point exactly matches a known point, it directly prints the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach the query point by adding the time taken to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each query separated by spaces and ensures that each test case's results are printed on a new line.

Based on the provided execution summary and the problem description, the program seems to handle all edge cases and constraints correctly. The use of binary search ensures efficient query processing, and the calculations for time and speed are consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
