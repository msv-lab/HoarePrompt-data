To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `l` is 0.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `m` is computed as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`.

2. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Compute `m`**:
   - `m` is computed as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

4. **Print `m`**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `m` is determined by the formula `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- Since the exact values of `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`.
- However, we know that `m` is an integer value because it is cast to an integer using `int(m)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **int(m) (where m is the value of m computed as m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
