The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `len(b)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `len(b)` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `len(b)` must still be greater than `i` (so `len(b)` must be greater than 3).

State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than 3, `bd` is a list that now includes the values `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`**
