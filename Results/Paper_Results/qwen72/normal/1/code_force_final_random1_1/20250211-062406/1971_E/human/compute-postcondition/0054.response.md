To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `m` step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
3. `t` is greater than 0.
4. `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, where `q` must be greater than 0.
5. `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1.
6. `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input.
7. `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
8. `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one.
9. `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`.
10. `l` is 1.
11. `ql` is the new value provided by the user input minus `a[s-1]`.
12. `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.

### Calculation of `m`:
1. `s` is determined as the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.
2. `ql` is the new value provided by the user input minus `a[s-1]`.
3. `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 5, 10, 15]` and the original `ql` is 7, then `s` would be 2 because `a[2] = 10` is the first element not less than 7.

2. **Calculate `ql`:**
   - `ql` is the new value provided by the user input minus `a[s-1]`.
   - If the new value provided by the user input is 12 and `s` is 2, then `ql = 12 - a[1] = 12 - 5 = 7`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
   - Using the same example, if `b = [0, 2, 4, 6]` and `bd = [0, 2, 2, 2]` and `ad = [0, 5, 5, 5]`, then:
     - `b[s - 1] = b[1] = 2`.
     - `bd[s] = bd[2] = 2`.
     - `ad[s] = ad[2] = 5`.
     - `m = 2 + (2 * 7 / 5) = 2 + 2.8 = 4.8`.

4. **Print `int(m)`:**
   - `int(m)` converts `m` to an integer.
   - In this case, `int(4.8) = 4`.

### Final Output:
Output: **4** (where 4 is the integer part of the calculated value of `m` based on the provided initial state and the formula used to calculate `m`).
