Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `l` is 1, `ql` is the new value provided by the user input minus `a[s-1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `b[s - 1]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l`, `ql`, `s`) remain unchanged.
