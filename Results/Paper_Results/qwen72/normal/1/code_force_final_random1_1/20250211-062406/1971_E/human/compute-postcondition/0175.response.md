Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the value at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `b`, `len(b)`, `bd`, `v`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `ql`, and `s`) remain unchanged or retain their conditions as specified in the initial state.
