To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces.
- `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `v` is a list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.
- `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 2.
- `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is the integer value of the user input minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index in `a` where the original `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, but no variables are modified.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b` and `bd`:**
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

2. **Understanding `v`:**
   - `v` is a list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.

3. **Understanding `m`:**
   - `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - `b[s - 1]` is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `b`.
   - `bd[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `bd`.
   - `ql` is the integer value of the user input minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `ad[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `ad`.

4. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index in `a` where the original `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, but no variables are modified.

### Calculation of `m`:
- `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`
- Since `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`, and `ql` is the user input minus `a[s - 1]`, the value of `m` depends on the specific values of `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `ql`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the dependencies on the user input and the lists `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `a`, the exact numerical value of `m` cannot be determined without specific values. However, the print statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
