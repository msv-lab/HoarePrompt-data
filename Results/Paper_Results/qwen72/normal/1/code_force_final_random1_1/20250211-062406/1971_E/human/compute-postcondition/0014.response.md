To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input.
- `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd` is a list containing only the element 0.
- `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(b)` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1).

### States to Adjust:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- The loop will execute if `len(b)` is greater than 1.

### Initial State:
- `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1.
- This initial value of `i` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Required State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `len(b)` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing only the element 0, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 1**
