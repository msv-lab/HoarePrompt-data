Output State: **`l` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
