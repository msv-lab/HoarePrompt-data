Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[1]` and the value (0, 1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[1]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` must contain at least two strings. `ind` is 1. If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 if `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[1]` is 'B', and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1). If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is not 'G', the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `line[1]` is equal to '..', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
