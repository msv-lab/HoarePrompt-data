The code snippet `elements[line[ind]] = i, ind` updates the dictionary `elements` by setting the key `line[ind]` to the tuple `(i, ind)`. Given the initial state:

- `n` and `m` are integers read from input and should satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd.
- `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
- `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1).
- `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary.
- `goal` is a list containing two empty lists.
- `points` is a list `[0, 0]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `line` must contain at least one string.
- `ind` is 0.
- The string at `line[ind]` is not equal to '..'.

After executing the code snippet:

- The key `line[ind]` in the dictionary `elements` is set to the tuple `(0, 0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input and should satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1) and the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` must contain at least one string, `ind` is 0, and the string at `line[ind]` is not equal to '..'.**
