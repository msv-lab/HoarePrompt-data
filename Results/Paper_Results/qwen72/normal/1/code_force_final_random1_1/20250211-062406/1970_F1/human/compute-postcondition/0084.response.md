Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers satisfying 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line` including the entry for `line[ind]` with the value `(1, ind)`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`. If `line[ind]` is a player string, the entry for `line[ind]` in `allPlayers` is set to `False`. `goal` is a list containing tuples for specific strings in `line`. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G' and `line[ind]` is not a player string, the tuple `(1, ind)` is appended to the list at index `1` and `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 1. `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element. `ind` is the last index of `line` (i.e., `len(line) - 1`). The last element of `line` (i.e., `line[ind]`) is not equal to '..'.***
