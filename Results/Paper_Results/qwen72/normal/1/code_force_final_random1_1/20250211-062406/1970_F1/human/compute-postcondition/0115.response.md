Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input with a length of 3.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `el` is not equal to '.Q'.
   - `el` is equal to '.S'.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `el` is explicitly given as '.S'.
   - Since `el` is '.S', it means the third element of `command` is '.S'.
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10, but the exact value of `points[team]` before this increase is not provided, so we only know it increases by 10.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`
   - `time` is 0.
   - `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`.

4. **Determine `GoalName[team]`:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0.
   - We need to assume `GoalName` is a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are defined. For the sake of this example, let's assume `GoalName[0]` is "Team A" and `GoalName[1]` is "Team B".

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and `GoalName[1]` is "Team B".
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and `GoalName[0]` is "Team A".

Given the initial state and the assumptions about `GoalName`, the output will be:

- If `obj[0]` is 'B':
  Output: **0 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**

- If `obj[0]` is not 'B':
  Output: **0 Team A CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**

Since the exact value of `obj[0]` is not provided, we can only provide the two possible outputs based on the given conditions. However, if we assume `obj[0]` is 'B' (as it is a common scenario in such problems), the most likely output is:

Output: **0 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
