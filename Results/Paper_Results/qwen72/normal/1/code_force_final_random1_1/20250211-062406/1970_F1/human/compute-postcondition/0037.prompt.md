Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers read from input and should satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0). If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[ind]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` must contain at least one string. `ind` is 0. If the second character of the string at `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[1]` and the value (0, 1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[1]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` must contain at least two strings. `ind` is 1. If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 if `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[1]` is 'B', and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1). If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is not 'G', the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `line[1]` is equal to '..', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[1]` and the value (0, 1), and the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[ind]` and the value (0, 2). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[1]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` also has the key `line[ind]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is false, `allPlayers` remains a dictionary with the key `line[ind]` and the value `False` or remains an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty. If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 if `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[1]` is 'B', and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1). If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is not 'G', the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the second character of the string at `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 2). If the second character of the string at `line[ind]` is not 'G', the state of the variables remains unchanged. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` must contain at least two strings. `ind` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
