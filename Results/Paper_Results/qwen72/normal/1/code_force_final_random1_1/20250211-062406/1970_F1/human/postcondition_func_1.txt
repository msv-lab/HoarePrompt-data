The function `goalIn` takes a position `pos` and determines whether this position is within the goal areas of either the red team or the blue team. It returns 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goal area, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goal area, and -1 if `pos` is not in any goal area. The function does not modify any input parameters.
