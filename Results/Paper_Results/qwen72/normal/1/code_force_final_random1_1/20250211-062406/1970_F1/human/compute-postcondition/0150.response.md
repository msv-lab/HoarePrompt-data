Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.
   - `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `team` is determined based on the first character of `obj`:
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is assumed to be a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are predefined strings. Since the exact values of `GoalName` are not provided, we will refer to them as `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and the print statement will use `GoalName[1]`.
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and the print statement will use `GoalName[0]`.

Therefore, the output will be one of the following:

- If `obj[0]` is 'B':
  ```python
  Output: **1 GoalName[1] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
  ```
- If `obj[0]` is not 'B':
  ```python
  Output: **1 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
  ```

Since the exact values of `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are not provided, the final output will depend on these values. Here is the precise description:

Output: **1 GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B', otherwise team is 0, and GoalName[team] is the corresponding string from the GoalName list)**
