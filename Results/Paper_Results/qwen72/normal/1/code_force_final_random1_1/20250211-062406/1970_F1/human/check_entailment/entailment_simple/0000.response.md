### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`), the initial state of the field, and the number of steps (`t`).
   - It initializes the `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` correctly based on the input.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) and updates the positions of entities in the `elements` dictionary.
   - It correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle (`C`) and updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - It correctly handles the throwing of the Quaffle (`T`) and checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal. If so, it updates the score and prints the appropriate message.

3. **Scoring and Elimination:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players when a player and the Bludger (`.B`) occupy the same position.

4. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as players moving out of bounds, invalid actions, and scoring in the wrong goal.

### Correctness:
Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
