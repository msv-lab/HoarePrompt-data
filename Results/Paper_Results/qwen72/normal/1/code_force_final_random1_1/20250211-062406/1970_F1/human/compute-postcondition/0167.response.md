Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `elements[obj] = nxt` updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`.
- All other variables (`t`, `time`, `command`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, `player`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, which is used to update `elements[obj]`.
