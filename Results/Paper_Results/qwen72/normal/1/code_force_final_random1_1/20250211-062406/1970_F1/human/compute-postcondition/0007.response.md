The line of code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the resulting string into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter. This list is then assigned to the variable `line`.

Given the initial state, the only change is to the variable `line`, which now holds a list of strings read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input and should satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input.**
