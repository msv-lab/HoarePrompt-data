Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets the value of `allPlayers[obj]` to `True`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The specific values of `t`, `time`, `command`, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are as given in the initial state, and `allPlayers[obj]` is now `True`.
