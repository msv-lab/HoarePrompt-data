Functionality: ** This function reads a grid and a series of commands from standard input to simulate a game. It initializes a grid of size `n x m` (where `n` and `m` are odd integers between 3 and 99) and populates it with elements, tracking their positions. It also tracks players, goals, and points for two teams. The function processes `t` commands, updating the game state accordingly, including moving players, scoring goals, catching the golden snitch, and eliminating players. The final scores for both teams are printed at the end. **
