Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers satisfying 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`, including the entry for `line[ind]` which is `(1, len(line))`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`. `goal` is a list containing tuples for specific strings in `line`. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 1. `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least three elements. `ind` is `len(line)`. `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, len(line))`.**
