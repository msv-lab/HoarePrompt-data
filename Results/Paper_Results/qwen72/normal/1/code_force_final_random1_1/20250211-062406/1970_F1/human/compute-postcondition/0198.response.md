The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function internally uses two integers, `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are odd and within the range of 3 to 99. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what the function returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but uses two internal integers, `n` and `m`, which are both odd and within the range of 3 to 99. The specific return value of the function is not specified.**
