Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a list of strings read from the input, representing the rows of the grid. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in the entire grid, with the key being the string and the value being a tuple (i, ind) where `i` is the row index and `ind` is the column index of the string in the grid. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in the grid, with the key being the player string and the value being `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (i, ind) for each string in the grid that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (i, ind) for each string in the grid that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is `n-1`. `line` is the last list of strings read from the input and has `m` elements. `ind` is `m-1`. If `line[ind]` is not '..': `elements` includes an entry for `line[ind]` which is `(n-1, m-1)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(n-1, m-1)`. If `line[ind]` is '..': no changes are made to any variables. `t` is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is ".S", `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not `.B`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers` now has `obj` set to `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B'`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged unless specified. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B'` and either `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B'] == nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`), and `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, `pos` remains the value of `elements[obj]` and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
