Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.***
