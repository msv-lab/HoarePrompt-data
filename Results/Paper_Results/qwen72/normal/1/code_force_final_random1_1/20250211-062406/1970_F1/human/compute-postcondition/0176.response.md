To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components of the statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `allPlayers` is mentioned but not used in the print statement.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points` is updated such that `points[team]` is increased by 10.
   - `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is a list or dictionary that contains the names of the goals. Since `GoalName` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is predefined elsewhere in the code and contains the goal names for both teams.

4. **Determine the Value of `team`:**
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - If `obj` starts with 'B', then `team` is 1.
   - If `obj` does not start with 'B', then `team` is 0.

5. **Determine the Value of `GoalName[team]`:**
   - If `team` is 1, `GoalName[1]` will be the goal name for team 1.
   - If `team` is 0, `GoalName[0]` will be the goal name for team 0.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will format the output as `%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`, where `%d` is replaced by the value of `time` (which is 2), and `%s` is replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

- If `obj` starts with 'B':
  - `team` is 1.
  - The output will be: `2 GoalName[1] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.

- If `obj` does not start with 'B':
  - `team` is 0.
  - The output will be: `2 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.

Since the exact value of `GoalName[team]` depends on the content of `GoalName`, we can only describe it in terms of the predefined goal names.

Output: **2 GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where team is 1 if the first character of obj is 'B', otherwise team is 0, and GoalName[team] is the corresponding goal name)**
