Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `team = goalIn(pos)` assigns the result of the function `goalIn(pos)` to the variable `team`.
- All other variables (`t`, `time`, `command`, `allPlayers`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, `player`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `team` is now the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which depends on the current position `pos`.
