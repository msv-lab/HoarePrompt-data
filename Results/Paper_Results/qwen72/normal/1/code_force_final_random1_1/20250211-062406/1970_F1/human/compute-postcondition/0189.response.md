The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, which is calculated as (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`.**
