To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.
   - `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`.
   - `GoalName[team]` is the value from the dictionary `GoalName` corresponding to the key `team`.

Given this information, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `time` is 2.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, which is a function call that returns a value based on the position `pos`.
- `GoalName[team]` is a string from the dictionary `GoalName` indexed by the value of `team`.

Since the exact value of `team` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the function `goalIn(pos)`. However, we can assume that `GoalName` is a dictionary that maps the result of `goalIn(pos)` to a string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where team is the result of goalIn(pos) and GoalName[team] is the corresponding value from the GoalName dictionary)**
