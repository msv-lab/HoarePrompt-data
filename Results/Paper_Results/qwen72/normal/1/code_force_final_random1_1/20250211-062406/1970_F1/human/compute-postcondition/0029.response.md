To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd.
- `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
- `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1).
- If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[1]` and the value (0, 1).
- If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0).
- If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[1]` and the value `False`.
- If `isPlayer(line[1])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary.
- `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty.
- `points` is a list `[0, 0]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `line` must contain at least two strings.
- `ind` is 1.
- If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 if `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[1]` is 'B', and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1).
- If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is not 'G', the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- If `line[1]` is equal to '..', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ind in range(len(line)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `line`.
- The loop variable `ind` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than the length of `line`.

### State Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The length of `line` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[1]` and the value (0, 1). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[1]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` must contain at least two strings. `ind` is 2. If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 if `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, otherwise `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[1]` is 'B', and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1). If the second character of the string at `line[1]` is not 'G', the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `line[1]` is equal to '..', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
