Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Quaffle**: The program incorrectly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle. For example, the `func_1` function checks for `.S` (which is not defined in the problem) and attempts to handle a golden snitch, which is not part of the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Elimination Logic**: The program includes logic for eliminating players (`print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`), which is not part of the problem description. The problem only involves moving, catching, and throwing the Quaffle, and scoring goals.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**: The `goalIn` function and the scoring logic within `func_1` do not correctly handle the scoring of goals. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

4. **Incorrect Movement Handling**: The program does not correctly update the position of the Quaffle when it is thrown or when it is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Missing Definitions**: The program references `mov` and `GoalName`, which are not defined in the provided code. These variables are necessary for the program to function correctly.

6. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program prints additional messages like "ELIMINATED" and "CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH," which are not required by the problem statement.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be revised to correctly handle the movement of players and the Quaffle, the catching and throwing of the Quaffe, and the scoring of goals according to the rules specified in the problem description.
