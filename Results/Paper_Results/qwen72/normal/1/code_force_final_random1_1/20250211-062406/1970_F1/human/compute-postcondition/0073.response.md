Output State: **`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`, with the key being the string and the value being a tuple (0, index) where index is the position of the string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`, with the key being the player string and the value being `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 1. `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input and has the same length as the number of iterations the loop executed. `ind` is the last index of `line` (i.e., `len(line) - 1`). For each index `ind` in `line` where `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` includes the entry for `line[ind]` which is `(0, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player string, the value for `line[ind]` in `allPlayers` is `False`. If `line[ind]` ends with 'G', the tuple `(0, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` starts with 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
