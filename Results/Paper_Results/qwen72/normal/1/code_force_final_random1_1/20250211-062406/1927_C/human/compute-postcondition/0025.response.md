Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 1. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, and `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0.***
