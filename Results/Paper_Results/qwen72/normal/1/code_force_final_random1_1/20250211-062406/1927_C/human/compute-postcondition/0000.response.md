To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `t` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `t` is already defined as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means `t` is within a valid range for the loop to potentially execute.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, because `range(x)` generates a sequence from 0 to x-1, and if x is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given this, the state needs to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. However, since `t` is already defined and the input is expected to provide the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` should return a value equal to `t`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, and `t` is within its defined range.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
