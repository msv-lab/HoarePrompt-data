Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 3 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
