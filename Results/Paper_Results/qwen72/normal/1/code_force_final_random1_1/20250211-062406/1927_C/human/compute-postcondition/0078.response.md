Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
