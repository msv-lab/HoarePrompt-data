Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 1. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than `aOnes`. Otherwise, if `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`. If `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` remains 0. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` remains 0. Additionally, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
