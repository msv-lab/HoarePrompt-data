Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to select `k/2` elements from array `a` and `k/2` elements from array `b` such that each selected element is unique and within the range `[1, k]`. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value. **
