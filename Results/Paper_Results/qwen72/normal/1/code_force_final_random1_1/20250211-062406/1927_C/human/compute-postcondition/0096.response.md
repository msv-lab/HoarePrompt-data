Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `bOnes` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `aOnes` retains its previous value and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.***
