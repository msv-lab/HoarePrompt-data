Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is the count of elements in `a` that meet the conditions specified in the loop, and `bOnes` is the count of elements in `b` that meet the conditions specified in the loop. Additionally, `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`.**
