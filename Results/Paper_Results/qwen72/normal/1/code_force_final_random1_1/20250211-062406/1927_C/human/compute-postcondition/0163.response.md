Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1.
- `n` is the first input integer greater than 0.
- `m` is the second input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is the third input integer greater than 0.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `b` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `aOnes` is the count of elements in `a` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
- `bOnes` is the count of elements in `b` that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
- Either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('no')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'no'`. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly. The statement will always print `'no'` regardless of the values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, or any other variables.

### Output:
Output: **no**
