Output State: **`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
