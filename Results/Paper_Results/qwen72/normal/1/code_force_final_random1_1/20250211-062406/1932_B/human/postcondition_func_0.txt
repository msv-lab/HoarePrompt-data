The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a value `year` by summing up `(year % ai or ai)` for each element `ai` in `a`. The function prints the calculated `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state is maintained.
