The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `ai` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `year` is now `year + (year % ai or ai)`, `ai` is the third element of `a`**
