The code snippet `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai` calculates the next year that is a multiple of `ai` from the current year.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements
- `test` is the third element of `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`
- `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`
- `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable
- `current_year` is 0
- `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0 (implying `ai` is not a divisor of `current_year`)

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `current_year // ai` performs integer division of `current_year` by `ai`. Since `current_year` is 0, `current_year // ai` results in 0.
2. `0 + 1` results in 1.
3. `1 * ai` results in `ai`.

Therefore, `next_year` is assigned the value `ai`.

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, plus the new value of `next_year`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is 0, `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0, `next_year` is `ai`.**
