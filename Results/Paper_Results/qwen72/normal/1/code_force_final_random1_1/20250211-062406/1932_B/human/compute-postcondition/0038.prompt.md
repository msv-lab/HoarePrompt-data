Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input with `n` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input with `len(a)` elements, `year` is the sum of each element `ai` in the list `a` where `ai` is the current element being processed in the loop, and `ai` is the last element of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, it is `t - 1`), `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers from user input with `len(a)` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in `a`, and `ai` is the last element of the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
