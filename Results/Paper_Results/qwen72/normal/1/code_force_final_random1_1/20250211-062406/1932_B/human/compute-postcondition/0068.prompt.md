Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `current_year` and the second element is also `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases`, and `current_year` is now 0.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is set to the first item (`ai`) of the iterable `a` if `current_year` was divisible by `ai`; otherwise, `next_year` is set to `ai` and `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `next_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `next_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `ai` is the next element in `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, `next_year` is now equal to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
