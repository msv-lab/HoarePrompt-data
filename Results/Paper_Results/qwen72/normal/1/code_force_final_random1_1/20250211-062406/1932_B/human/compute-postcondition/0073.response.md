Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` as inputs. `test_cases` contains `t` elements, each a list with two items: an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function calculates the smallest year `current_year` for each test case such that `current_year` is a multiple of all integers in the corresponding list. The function returns a list `results` containing these calculated years for each test case. **
