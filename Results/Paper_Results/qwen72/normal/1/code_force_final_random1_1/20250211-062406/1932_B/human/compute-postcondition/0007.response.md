The only objects in the loop head are variables `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is `ai`, `ai` is the second element of `a`.**
