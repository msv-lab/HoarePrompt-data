Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` according to the loop logic.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- **`test_cases`**: The list remains unchanged.
- **`test`**: Still refers to the third element of `test_cases`.
- **`results`**: Both elements in the list are now equal to the final value of `current_year`.
- **`n`**: Remains the first item of the third element of `test_cases`.
- **`a`**: The iterable `a` is processed completely by the loop.
- **`current_year`**: After the loop finishes, `current_year` will be the result of applying the loop logic to each element in `a`. Specifically, for each `ai` in `a`:
  - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, `current_year` is incremented by `ai`.
  - Otherwise, `current_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `ai` greater than or equal to `current_year`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop on the iterable `a`.
