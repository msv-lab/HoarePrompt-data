Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `best` is 0, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists, `res` is the user input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to `n-1` and `k` remains the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.***
