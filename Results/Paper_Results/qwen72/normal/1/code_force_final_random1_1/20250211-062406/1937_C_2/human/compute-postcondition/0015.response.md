Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `i` is 4.
- `k` is 1.
- `res` is the new input string provided.
- If `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to 3.
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is greater than 4, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `k` is initially 1, but it can be updated to 3 if `res` is '<'.
   - `res` is the input string, but its value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we need to consider both cases: `res` is '<' and `res` is not '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output the following values:
     - `'?'` (a string)
     - `0` (an integer)
     - `k` (an integer, which can be either 1 or 3 depending on the value of `res`)
     - `0` (an integer)
     - `i` (an integer, which is 4)

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is '<':
  - `k` is updated to 3.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 3 0 4`.

- If `res` is not '<':
  - `k` remains 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 1 0 4`.

### Final Output:
Since the value of `res` is not explicitly provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the question asks for the output based on the initial state, which does not specify the value of `res`. Therefore, we will assume the most general case where `k` could be either 1 or 3.

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 4 (where [k] is 1 if res is not '<' and 3 if res is '<')**
