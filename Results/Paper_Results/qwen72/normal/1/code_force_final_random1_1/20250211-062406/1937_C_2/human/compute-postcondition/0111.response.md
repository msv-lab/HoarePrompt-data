Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `best` is set to `n` if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` remains 0.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `res` is the user input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**: 
   - If `res` was ever '<' during the execution, `k` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If `res` was never '<', `k` will be 1.

2. **`best`**:
   - If `res` is '<', `best` is set to `n`.
   - Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

3. **`i`**:
   - `i` is always 1 in the initial state.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `res` is '<':
  - `best` will be `n`.
  - `k` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. Since `i` is 1 initially, `k` will be 1 unless it changes later in the program.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 n 1 1`.

- **Scenario 2**: If `res` is not '<':
  - `best` will be 0.
  - `k` will be 1 because no `i` has made `res` '<'.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 1 1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the scenarios, the output will be one of the following:

- If `res` is '<':
  Output: **? 1 n 1 1**

- If `res` is not '<':
  Output: **? 1 0 1 1**

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we use `n` in the output where applicable. The final output, considering both scenarios, is:

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 1 (where [best] is n if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
