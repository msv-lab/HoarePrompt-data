Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `best` is `n`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists, `res` is the user input.**

Explanation: The value of `best` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is currently `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
