### Reasoning:

1. **Handling Small Case (n = 2):**
   - When \( n = 2 \), the only possible permutation is \([0, 1]\) or \([1, 0]\). In both cases, the maximum XOR value is \(0 \oplus 1 = 1\). Therefore, the function directly prints `! 0 1` and returns. This is correct.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index:**
   - The function initializes `max_index` to 0. It then iterates through all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_0 \mid p_{\text{max_index}} \) with \( p_0 \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_0 \mid p_i \) is greater, it updates `max_index` to \( i \). This ensures that `max_index` points to the index with the highest value of \( p_0 \mid p_i \).

3. **Finding the Minimum Indices:**
   - After finding the `max_index`, the function initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
   - It then iterates through all indices \( i \) again and compares \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices}[0]} \) with \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i \) is smaller, it updates `min_indices` to contain only \( i \). If they are equal, it appends \( i \) to `min_indices`. This ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices that have the same minimum value when OR-ed with `max_index`.

4. **Selecting the Minimum Index:**
   - The function initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - It then iterates through `min_indices` and compares \( p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_index}} \) with \( p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i \).
   - If they are equal, it updates `min_index` to \( i \). This ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the function prints `! max_index min_index` and returns. This outputs the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, using at most \( 3n \) queries. The steps are logically sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
