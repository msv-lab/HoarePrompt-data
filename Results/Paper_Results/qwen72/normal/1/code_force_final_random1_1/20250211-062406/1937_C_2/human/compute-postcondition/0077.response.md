Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: 
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.

2. **Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If no such `i` exists, `k` is set to 1.

3. **Value of `best`**:
   - `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - If no such `i` exists, `best` is set to 0.

### Determining the Output:
- The print statement will output the string `'!'` followed by the values of `k` and `best`.
- Since the exact values of `k` and `best` depend on the conditions described, we need to consider both scenarios:
  - If there was a value of `i` for which `res` was '<':
    - `k` will be the last such value of `i`.
    - `best` will also be the last such value of `i`.
  - If no such value of `i` exists:
    - `k` will be 1.
    - `best` will be 0.

### Final Output:
- If there was a value of `i` for which `res` was '<':
  - Output: **! [last value of i for which res was '<'] [last value of i for which res was '<']**
- If no such value of `i` exists:
  - Output: **! 1 0**

Since the exact values of `k` and `best` depend on the specific conditions, the most precise description is:

Output: **! [k] [best] (where k is the last value of i for which res was '<', or 1 if no such i exists, and best is the last value of i for which res was '<', or 0 if no such i exists)**
