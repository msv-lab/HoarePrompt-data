Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `res` is the new input string provided by the user.
   - If `res` is '<', `best` is set to 2. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `k`: This value depends on the history of `res`. If there was a previous `i` where `res` was '<', `k` will be that `i`. If no such `i` exists, `k` is 1.
   - `best`: This value depends on the current `res`. If `res` is '<', `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is 0.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 3.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If `res` is '<':
     - `best` will be 2.
     - `k` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. If this is the first time `res` is '<', `k` will be 3 (since `i` is currently 3).
   - **Scenario 2:** If `res` is not '<':
     - `best` will be 0.
     - `k` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `k` will be 1.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - `k` will be 3 (assuming this is the first time `res` is '<').
     - `best` will be 2.
     - The output will be: `? 3 2 3 3`.
   - If `res` is not '<':
     - `k` will be 1 (if no previous `<`).
     - `best` will be 0.
     - The output will be: `? 1 0 1 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the most precise answer based on the given information is:

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where [k] is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists, and [best] is 2 if `res` is '<' or 0 otherwise)**
