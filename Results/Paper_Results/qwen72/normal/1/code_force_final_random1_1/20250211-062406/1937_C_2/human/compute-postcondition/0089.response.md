Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `res` is an input string, `k` is 1 if `res` is not '<', otherwise `k` is 2.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string. The value of `k` depends on the new value of `res`. If the new `res` is '<', then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `best` remain unchanged.
