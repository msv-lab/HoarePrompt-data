Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists, `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
