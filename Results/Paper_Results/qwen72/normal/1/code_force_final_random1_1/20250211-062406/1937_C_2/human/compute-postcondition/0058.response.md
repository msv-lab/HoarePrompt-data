Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the value `n-1`, as the loop iterates from 2 to `n-1`. The variable `k` will hold the last value of `i` for which the condition `res == '<'` was true. If no such `i` exists (i.e., `res` was never '<'), then `k` will remain 1, as it was initialized. The loop will have completed its execution, and `n` will still be the same as it was initially, since it is not modified within the loop.
