Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is \(\log_2(n_{\text{cases}})\).
- `power` is `power - 1` and is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n_cases` and `n`:**
   - `n_cases` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `n_cases`, i.e., \( n = \log_2(n_{\text{cases}}) \).

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is defined as `power - 1`, but this is a bit confusing because it suggests a recursive or iterative definition. However, since `power` is not explicitly initialized, we need to infer its value from the context.
   - The condition states that `power` is not equal to `n`.

3. **Calculating `2 ** power`:**
   - The expression `2 ** power` computes 2 raised to the power of `power`.
   - Since `power` is not equal to `n`, it could be any other value, but we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of `power`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we know that `power` is not equal to `n`, but we don't have a specific value for `power`. Therefore, the output of the print statement will depend on the value of `power`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is a value such that power is not equal to n, and n is the base-2 logarithm of n_cases)**
