The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `n`. Since `power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop condition (`power < n`) is true.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2**
