The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `power` is decremented by 1 if it is not equal to the input integer, otherwise it remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `i`, `n_cases`, `n`, and `power` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **1**
