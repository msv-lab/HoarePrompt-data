Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `power`, `power` is equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`.
- When the loop finishes, `power` will be equal to `n`.
- The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to `power` ensures that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
