To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `power < n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 1
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- `n` is set to the log2 of the input integer
- `power` is 1

The loop condition is `power < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `power` is 1
- `n` is the log2 of the input integer, which means `n` is a non-negative number (since the logarithm of any positive integer is non-negative).

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. This is because if `n` were 1 or less, `power` (which is 1) would not be less than `n`, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `power` is 1**
