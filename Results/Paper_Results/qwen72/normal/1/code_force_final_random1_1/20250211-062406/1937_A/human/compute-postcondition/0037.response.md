Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `power` - 1, `power` is `power` - 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

The value of `power` is decremented by 1, and the other conditions remain unchanged. Specifically, `i` is still 1, `n_cases` is still greater than 1, `n` is now greater than or equal to the new value of `power` (which is `power` - 1), and `power` is no longer equal to `n`.
