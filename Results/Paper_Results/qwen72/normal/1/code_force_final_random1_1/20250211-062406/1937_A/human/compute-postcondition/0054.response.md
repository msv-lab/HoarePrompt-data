Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1.
   - `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` (i.e., `n = log2(n_cases)`).
   - `power` is equal to `n`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since `n` is defined as `log2(n_cases)`, it means `n` is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to get `n_cases`.
   - `power` is set to `n`, so `power` is also `log2(n_cases)`.
   - The expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** log2(n_cases)`.
   - By the properties of logarithms, `2 ** log2(n_cases)` simplifies to `n_cases`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `n_cases`.

Output: **n_cases (where n_cases is the value of n_cases, which is greater than 1)**
