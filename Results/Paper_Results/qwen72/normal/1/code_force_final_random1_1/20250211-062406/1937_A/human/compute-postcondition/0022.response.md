The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n_cases` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `n` is set to the log2 of the input integer, and if `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decremented by 1.**
