Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to include the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` if it was initially 0.***
