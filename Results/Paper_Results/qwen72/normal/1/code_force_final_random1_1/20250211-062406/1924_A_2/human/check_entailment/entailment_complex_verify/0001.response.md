### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences found, `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen, and `ans` to store the constructed string.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index (`cur_ss`).
     - Checks if the character has been seen before using the bitmask `cur`.
     - If the character is new, updates the bitmask `cur`.
     - If all `k` characters have been seen (i.e., `cur == (1 << k) - 1`), increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - Appends the character to `ans`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, prints "YES".
     - If false, prints "NO" and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - Finds the first character that is missing from the bitmask `cur`.
       - Appends this character to `ans`.
       - Appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The logic for constructing the string `ans` is flawed. It should generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence, but the current logic appends characters in a way that may not ensure the string is of length `n` and does not occur as a subsequence.
   - Specifically, the program appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to `ans`, which may not form a valid string that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and check if they are subsequences of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

Final: **False**
