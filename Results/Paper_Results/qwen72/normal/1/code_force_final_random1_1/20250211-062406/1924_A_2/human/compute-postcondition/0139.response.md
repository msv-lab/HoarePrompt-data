Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` includes the second character in `s`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
