Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` includes the first character of `s`. Otherwise, if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to include the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set to 1.***
