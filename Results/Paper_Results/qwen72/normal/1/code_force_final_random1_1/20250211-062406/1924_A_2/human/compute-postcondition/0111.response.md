Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is updated by appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to its current value, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last character set or is an empty string if no bit was 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `k-1`.
- The value of `k` remains greater than or equal to `k`.
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the string `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times to its current value.
- The value of `tmp` remains unchanged, which is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise it remains the last character set or is an empty string if no bit was 0.
