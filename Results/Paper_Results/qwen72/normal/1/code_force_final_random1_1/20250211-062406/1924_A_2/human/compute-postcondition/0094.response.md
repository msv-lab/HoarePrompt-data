The `print('NO')` statement will print the string `'NO'`.

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` during any iteration, otherwise it holds the final value after processing all characters in `s`.
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
