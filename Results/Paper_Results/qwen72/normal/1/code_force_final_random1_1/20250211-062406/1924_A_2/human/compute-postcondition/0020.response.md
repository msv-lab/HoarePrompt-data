Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 1 << (ASCII value of the second character of `s` - 97), `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`. This means `cur` is now equal to 1 shifted left by the value of `cur_ss`.
- The value of `cur_ss` remains the same, which is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
