Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one more character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is now `ans + ss`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += ss` adds the value of `ss` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `ss`.
