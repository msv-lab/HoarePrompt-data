The value of `cur` is updated by adding the result of `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. The value of `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This means `cur_ss` is a number between 0 and 25 (inclusive), depending on the second character of `s`. Shifting 1 left by `cur_ss` bits results in a power of 2 corresponding to the position of `cur_ss`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
