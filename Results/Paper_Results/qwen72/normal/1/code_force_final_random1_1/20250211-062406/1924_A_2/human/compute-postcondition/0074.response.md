The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state related to `ss` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the current character being processed, and `s` is the input string that must have at least one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character remaining to be processed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` must have at least one character.
- `ss` was the current character being processed.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `s` must have at least two characters (since one character has already been processed).
- `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
