Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. The variable `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` during any iteration, otherwise it holds the final value after processing all characters in `s`. The variable `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop. The variable `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`. The variable `tmp` is an empty string (`''`).**
