To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for ss in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

In this loop, the variable `ss` iterates over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string
- `cnt` is 0
- `cur` is 0
- `ans` is an empty string

We need to ensure that `s` is not an empty string for the loop to execute. Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `s` must have at least one character.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string**
