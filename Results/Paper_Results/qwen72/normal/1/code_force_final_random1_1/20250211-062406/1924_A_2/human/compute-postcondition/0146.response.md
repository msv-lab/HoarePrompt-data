The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` (which is the third character in the string `s`) to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` already includes the third character in `s`, appending `ss` again means `ans` now contains the third character twice.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes the third character in `s` repeated twice.**
