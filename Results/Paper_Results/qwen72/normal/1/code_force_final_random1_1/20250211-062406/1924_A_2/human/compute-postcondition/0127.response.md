The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1 if it was previously 0, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, meaning all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` are set to 1, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
