To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution
- `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string**
