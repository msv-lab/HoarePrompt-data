To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to `k` (this is always true, so it doesn't provide new information).
   - `ans` is updated by appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to its current value.
   - `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last character set or is an empty string if no bit was 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ans` is a string that is being updated by appending a certain number of `'a'` characters.
   - The number of `'a'` characters appended is determined by the expression `(n - cnt - 1)`.
   - `n` and `cnt` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they must be known values for the expression to make sense.
   - `cur` is a binary number or a string representing a binary number, and `i` is used to check the bit at position `i`.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` is updated by appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to its current value.
   - Without knowing the exact values of `n` and `cnt`, we cannot determine the exact number of `'a'` characters appended.
   - However, we know that `ans` will contain a string of `'a'` characters based on the formula `(n - cnt - 1)`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the updated value of `ans`.
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'a' * (n - cnt - 1) (where n and cnt are known values, and ans is the string formed by appending 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) to its current value)**
