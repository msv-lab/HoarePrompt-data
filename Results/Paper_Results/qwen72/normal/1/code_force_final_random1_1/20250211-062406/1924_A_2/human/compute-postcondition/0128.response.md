Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cur` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was `(1 << k) - 1`.
- The other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt`) retain their previous values or conditions, with `cnt` being incremented by 1.
