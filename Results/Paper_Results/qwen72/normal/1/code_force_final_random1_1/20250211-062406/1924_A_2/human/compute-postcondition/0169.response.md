Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0 plus the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))` if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains as it was (either an empty string or the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`), `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
