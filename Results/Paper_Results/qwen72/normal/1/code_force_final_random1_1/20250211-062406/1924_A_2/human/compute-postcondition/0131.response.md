The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which is derived from the string `s`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `ss` based on the progression through the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` needs to be the next character in the string `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, after the first iteration, `ss` should now be the second character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**
