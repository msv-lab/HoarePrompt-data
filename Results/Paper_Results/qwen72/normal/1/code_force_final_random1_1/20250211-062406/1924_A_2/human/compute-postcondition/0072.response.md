The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially an empty string and `ss` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, we assume `ss` is a variable that holds a string value. However, since `ss` is not defined in the initial state, we infer that `ss` might be a typo or a placeholder for `cur_ss`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string that must have at least one character
- `cnt` is 1
- `ans` is an empty string
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97
- `cur` is 0

The code `ans += ss` would append the value of `ss` (which we assume is `cur_ss`) to `ans`. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97, and `ans` is initially an empty string, after executing the code, `ans` will contain the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `cur_ss` plus 97.

For example, if the first character of `s` is 'a', then `cur_ss` is 0, and `ans` will become 'a'. If the first character of `s` is 'b', then `cur_ss` is 1, and `ans` will become 'b'.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**
