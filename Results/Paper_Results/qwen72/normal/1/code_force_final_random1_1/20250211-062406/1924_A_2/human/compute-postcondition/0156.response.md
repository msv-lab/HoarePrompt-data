Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus `i` to the variable `tmp`.
- Since `i` is 0, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `ord('a')`, which is 97.
- `chr(97)` is 'a', so `tmp` is set to 'a'.
- All other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `k`, and the bit at position `i` in `cur`) remain unchanged.
