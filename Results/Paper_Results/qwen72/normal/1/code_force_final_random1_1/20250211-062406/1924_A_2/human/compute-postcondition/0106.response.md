The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp` based on the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `tmp` is calculated as follows:

- `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97.
- Adding `i` (which is 2) to 97 gives 99.
- `chr(99)` returns the character 'c'.

Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'c'. The conditions regarding `k` and the bit at position `i` in `cur` do not affect the execution of this specific line of code. The output state reflects the updated value of `tmp` while maintaining the other conditions.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `tmp` is 'c'.**
