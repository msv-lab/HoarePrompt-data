Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` during any iteration, otherwise it holds the final value after processing all characters in `s`.
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, and currently `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'. The conditions described do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself, as it is a fixed string.

Output: **YES**
