Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` relative to 'a', `cur` is 0.** 

The code sets `cur` to 0, which overrides any previous value that `cur` might have had. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
