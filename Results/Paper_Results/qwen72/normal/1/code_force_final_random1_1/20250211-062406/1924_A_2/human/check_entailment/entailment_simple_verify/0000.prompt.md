You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. The variable `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during all iterations of the loop. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the variable `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the presence of all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, the program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`, but it does not correctly generate or check all possible combinations of these characters to ensure they appear as subsequences.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `m = 3`, `s = "abb"`

The program should output:
- Output: `NO`
- Followed by a string like `"aa"` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this case. It uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters, but it does not generate all possible subsequences of length `n` and check if they are present in `s`. Instead, it increments a counter `cnt` whenever it finds a new character in the string, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.

### Example:
For the input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The program will output:
```
NO
aa
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `2` (i.e., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are present in the string "abb". The program fails to correctly identify that "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
