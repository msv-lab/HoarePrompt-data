The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers. The function returns two values: the first value is the sum of `x` and `dx`, and the second value is the sum of `y` and `dy`. Since the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not specified, the exact numerical results of the returned values cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns two values: the sum of `x` and `dx`, and the sum of `y` and `dy`.**
