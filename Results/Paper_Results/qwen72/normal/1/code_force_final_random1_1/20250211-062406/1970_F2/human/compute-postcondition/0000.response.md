The code snippet `x, y = a` attempts to unpack the value of `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. However, since `a` is described as an integer, it cannot be unpacked in this way because an integer is not an iterable object. This will result in a `TypeError`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that an error occurs.

Output State: **a and b are integers, an error occurs due to attempting to unpack an integer.**
