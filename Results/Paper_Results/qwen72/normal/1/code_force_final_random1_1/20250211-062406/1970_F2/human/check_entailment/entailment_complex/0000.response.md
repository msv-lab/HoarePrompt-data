Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes dictionaries for players and goals, and a dictionary for movements.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle, goals, and players from the input.

2. **Movement Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the movement of entities. It takes the current position and a direction, and returns the new position. This function is used correctly throughout the program.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program reads the number of moves and processes each move accordingly.
   - For player movements, it updates the player's position and checks for collisions with the Bludger.
   - When a player is eliminated, it prints the elimination message and removes the player from the game.
   - For catching the Quaffle, it updates the player who is carrying the Quaffle.
   - For throwing the Quaffle, it checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

4. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - The program correctly handles scoring when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
   - It also handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - Elimination due to Bludger collision is handled correctly, and the program ensures that the Quaffle remains in the correct position if the player carrying it is eliminated.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the final score after processing all the moves.

However, there are a few issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Quaffle Catching**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The logic for checking if a player has scored a goal is incorrect. It should check if the player is at a goal and then update the score and reset the Quaffle's position. The current logic has redundant conditions and incorrect handling of the Quaffle's position.

3. **Bludger Collision**:
   - The program correctly handles Bludger collisions, but it should ensure that the Quaffle's position is updated correctly if the player carrying it is eliminated.

Given these issues, the program is not entirely correct. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
