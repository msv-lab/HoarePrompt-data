Output State: **The program returns the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`. Since `a` and `b` remain unchanged and there is no information about the values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy`, the exact numerical results cannot be determined. However, the program will return two values: the first being the sum of `x` and `dx`, and the second being the sum of `y` and `dy`.**
