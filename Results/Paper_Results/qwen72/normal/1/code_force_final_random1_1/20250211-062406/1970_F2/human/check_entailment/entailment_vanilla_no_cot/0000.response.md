Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**: The function `func_1` is used to update the position of entities, but the direction mapping (`mouvements`) is incorrect. The directions should map to changes in coordinates like so:
   - 'L': (-1, 0) (move left, decrease x)
   - 'R': (1, 0) (move right, increase x)
   - 'U': (0, -1) (move up, decrease y)
   - 'D': (0, 1) (move down, increase y)
   However, the current mapping is:
   - 'L': (-1, 0)
   - 'R': (1, 0)
   - 'U': (0, -1)
   - 'D': (0, 1)
   This is correct, but the function `func_1` should be applied correctly to update the positions.

2. **Quaffle Catching Logic**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison instead of an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is incorrect. The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list, but it should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and then check if the position is in the opponent's goal. The current logic incorrectly updates the Quaffle position when a goal is scored.

4. **Bludger Elimination Logic**: The elimination logic for players hit by the Bludger is mostly correct, but it should handle the case where the player is carrying the Quaffle and is eliminated. The Quaffle should remain in the cell where the player was eliminated.

5. **Final Score Output**: The final score output is correct, but it should be ensured that the program handles all edge cases correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant parts of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch[1] = ''
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R'] and quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B'] and quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly according to the problem description.
