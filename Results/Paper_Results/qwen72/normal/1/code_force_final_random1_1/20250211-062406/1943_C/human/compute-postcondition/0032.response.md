Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[b]`. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`. `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function. `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (not used). `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n]`.**
