The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust these. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop iterates `n - 1` times, and one iteration has already completed, the remaining number of iterations is `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1, but the number of iterations left is `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u-1`, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1 (though it's not used, it represents the progress in the loop)**

However, since `_` is not used and just represents the progress, the key state to focus on is `n` and the condition for the loop to continue executing. Thus, the simplified state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u-1`, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`**
