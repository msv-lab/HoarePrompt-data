The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. The value of `i` remains 3, and `c1` remains `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`. The value of `c2` is not specified, but it is used in the appended tuple. The length of `path_ba` is still greater than 4. The new tuple `(c2, 3)` is added to the existing list `ops`.

Output State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 4, `i` is 3, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**.
