Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`, `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (not used), `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
