Output State: **The program returns None. The variables `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, `i`, `n`, and `ops` remain unchanged from their initial state. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is `ci + 1`, `n` is `-1`, and `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, where `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`.**
