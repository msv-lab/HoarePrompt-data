Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains greater than 1, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex 0, and `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used).**
