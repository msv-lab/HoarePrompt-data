The function `func_2` reads from standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. It then determines a path between two specific vertices in the tree and calculates a series of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it generates operations involving the middle vertex of the path. If the path length is even, it generates operations involving two middle vertices of the path. These operations are stored in the list `ops` and printed to the standard output, along with the length of `ops`. The function returns `None` and does not modify the internal state of the program beyond the creation and manipulation of the `ops` list.
