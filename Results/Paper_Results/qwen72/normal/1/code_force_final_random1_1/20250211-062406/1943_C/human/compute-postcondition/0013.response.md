Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, the list at index `v-1` contains the value `u-1`, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u`. `u` is the first integer from user input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from user input minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`.
- The initial state specifies that `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, and the list at index `v-1` already contains the value `u-1`.
- After executing the code, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` in addition to its existing contents.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
