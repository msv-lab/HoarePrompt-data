The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` adds the value `v` to the list located at index `u` in the `u2vs` list. This modifies the `u2vs` list but does not change the values of `n`, `u`, or `v`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v-1`, and the list at index `v-1` contains the value `u-1`. Additionally, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` now contains the value `v`. `u` is the first integer from user input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from user input minus 1.**
