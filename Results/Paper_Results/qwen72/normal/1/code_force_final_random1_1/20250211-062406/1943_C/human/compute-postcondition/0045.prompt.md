Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains greater than 1, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`, and `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function. `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used). `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`. `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value of `previous[b]`. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`. `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function. `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (not used). `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the value of `previous[n]`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`, `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (not used), `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n, n]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from vertex `a`, `previous` is the array of previous vertices returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (not used), `b` is the result of the function `func_1` applied to the distance array `d`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
