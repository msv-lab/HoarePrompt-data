The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables within the current iteration, and the conditions that were true before the `continue` statement remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
