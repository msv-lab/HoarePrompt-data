Output State: **After all iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all values encountered when `t` is 3, and `count_num` is 0. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged if no updates were made during the loop.**
