The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `num`. If `num` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `num` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `num`.

State: **`num` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
