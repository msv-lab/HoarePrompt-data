The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` and `v` are integers from the input. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element, and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `t` is 2 and `end` â‰¤ `v`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v` and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` â‰¥ `v`, `start` remains unchanged and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is not 1, 2, or 3, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**
