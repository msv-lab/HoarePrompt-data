Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of constraints and processes each constraint to determine the range of possible values for `k` and the specific values that `k` cannot take. The function `func_7` handles the core logic of the problem, updating the minimum and maximum bounds for `k` and keeping track of the numbers that `k` cannot be. Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints, taking into account the exclusions. The program's structure and logic align with the requirements of the problem statement.
