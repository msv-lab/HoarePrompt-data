The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, inclusive. It also initializes `start` and `end` to specific floating-point values (-1 and 1000000000.0, respectively) and starts with an empty list `num`.

The function has two possible outputs:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to return 0 in certain conditions, or the adjusted difference between `end` and `start` based on the number of elements in `num` that fall within the specified range, ensuring the result is non-negative.
