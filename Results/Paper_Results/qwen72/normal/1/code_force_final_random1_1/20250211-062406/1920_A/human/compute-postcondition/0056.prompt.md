Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all values encountered when `t` is 3, and `count_num` is 0. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged if no updates were made during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`num` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`num` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`num` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `count_num`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
