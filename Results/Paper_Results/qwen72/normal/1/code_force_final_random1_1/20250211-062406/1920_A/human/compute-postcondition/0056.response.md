Output State: **After all iterations, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` contains all values encountered when `t` is 3, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` will be the total number of elements in the list `num`.
- The variable `i` will be the last element in the list `num`.
- The variables `start` and `end` will retain their initial values unless they were updated based on conditions outside the provided loop.
- The list `num` will still contain all the values it had initially.
- The variable `count_num` will be the count of elements in `num` that fall within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).
