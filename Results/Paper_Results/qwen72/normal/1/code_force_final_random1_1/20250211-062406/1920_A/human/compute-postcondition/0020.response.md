The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` and `v` are integers from the input, `start` and `end` are updated based on the conditions described, and if `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element.**
