Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` and `v` are integers from the input. If `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`, `end` is updated based on the conditions described, and if `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is updated based on the conditions described, and if `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element.***
