You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start and end are floating-point numbers initialized to -1 and 1000000000.0 respectively. num is an empty list.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `num` is a list containing all values encountered when `t` is 3. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged if no updates were made during the loop.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` contains all values encountered when `t` is 3, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` contains all values encountered when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns 0 in certain conditions, or the adjusted difference between `end` and `start` based on the number of elements in `num` that fall within the specified range, ensuring the result is non-negative.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
