The function `func_2` takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is `True`, the line is split into a list of strings based on spaces. If `space` is `False`, the line is treated as a sequence of characters, resulting in a list of characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each item in the list is converted to an integer. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is `True`, or a list of strings/characters if `to_int` is `False`.
