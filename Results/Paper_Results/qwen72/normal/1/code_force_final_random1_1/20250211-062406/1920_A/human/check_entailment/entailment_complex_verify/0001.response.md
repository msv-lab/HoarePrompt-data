### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` to represent the initial bounds for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `t` and the value `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to `x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to `x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `3` (k must be not equal to `x`), it appends `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It initializes `count_num` to 0 to count the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It iterates through the list `num` and increments `count_num` for each value that is within the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid integers (`count_num`).

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization**:
  - `start` is initialized to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. This ensures that the initial bounds are wide enough to encompass any valid range of `k`.

- **Constraint Processing**:
  - The constraints are processed correctly:
    - Type 1 constraints update `start` to the maximum value encountered.
    - Type 2 constraints update `end` to the minimum value encountered.
    - Type 3 constraints add the value to the list `num`.

- **Counting Invalid Integers**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The function checks if `start` is greater than `end` and returns 0 if true, which is correct because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
  - The final calculation `end - start + 1 - count_num` correctly computes the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` after excluding the invalid integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The initial bounds for `start` and `end` are set appropriately, and the final calculation ensures that the result is non-negative and accounts for the invalid integers.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final: **True**
