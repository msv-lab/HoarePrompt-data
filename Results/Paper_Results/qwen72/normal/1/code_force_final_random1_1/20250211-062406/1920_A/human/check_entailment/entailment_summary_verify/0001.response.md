### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` to represent the initial bounds for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `t` and the value `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to `x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to `x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `3` (k must be not equal to `x`), it appends `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It initializes `count_num` to 0 to count the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It iterates through the list `num` and increments `count_num` for each value that is within the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid integers (`count_num`).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - `start` is initialized to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. This ensures that any valid constraint will update these values appropriately.
  
- **Constraint Processing**:
  - Type 1 constraints update `start` to the maximum value encountered, ensuring that `k` is at least as large as the largest lower bound.
  - Type 2 constraints update `end` to the minimum value encountered, ensuring that `k` is at most as large as the smallest upper bound.
  - Type 3 constraints add values to the `num` list, which will later be used to exclude specific values from the valid range.

- **Counting Invalid Integers**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` and stores this count in `count_num`.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The function checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid integers (`count_num`). This ensures that the result is the number of valid integers.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The initial assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
