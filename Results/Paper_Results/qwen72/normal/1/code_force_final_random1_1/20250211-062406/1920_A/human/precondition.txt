isOne is a boolean value. However, this function definition does not match the problem description provided. The function should take the constraints as input and process them to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. A more appropriate function definition would be something like `def count_valid_ks(constraints):` where `constraints` is a list of tuples, each representing a constraint.
