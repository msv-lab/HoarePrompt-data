### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
   - `func_1` is used to read the number of test cases `t`. This is correct as it reads an integer from the input.
   - `func_2` is used to read the number of constraints `n` and the constraints themselves. This is also correct as it reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Constraint Processing (`func_7`)**:
   - `func_7` processes each test case. It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to a large number (1,000,000,000).
   - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - Type 1 (`k >= x`): Updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - Type 2 (`k <= x`): Updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - Type 3 (`k != x`): Adds `x` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 (no valid `k`).
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[start, end]` minus the count of invalid numbers in `num`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases, calls `func_7` for each test case, and appends the result to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in `ans`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the constraints as described in the problem statement.
- The logic for updating `start` and `end` and counting the valid integers `k` is correct.
- The program ensures that the answer is finite and handles edge cases (e.g., when `start` is greater than `end`).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
