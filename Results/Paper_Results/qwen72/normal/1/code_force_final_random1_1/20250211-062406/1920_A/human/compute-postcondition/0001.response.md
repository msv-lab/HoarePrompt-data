Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `start = -1` reassigns the value of `start` to -1, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
