Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: Although `func_1` is defined, it is not used in the provided code. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the program.
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function takes a string `s` as input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the input string.
   - It iterates over the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of parentheses. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - After the loop, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by the position (in descending order).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

3. **Sorting Criteria**:
   - The sorting criteria ensure that the sequence is shuffled according to the specified rules:
     - First, by the balance of the prefix (in ascending order).
     - Second, by the position (in descending order) to break ties.
   - This matches the problem statement's requirement for the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Validation**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.
   - The final result is a valid balanced parentheses sequence, as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
