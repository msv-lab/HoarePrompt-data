The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list by 1. Since all three `BalanceInfo` objects have the same `balance` value initially, they will all be updated in the same way.

Let's break down the changes:

- The initial `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object is 2 if the third character of `s` is '(', or -2 if the third character of `s` is ')'.
- After executing `balance += 1`, the new `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object will be 3 if the third character of `s` is '(', or -1 if the third character of `s` is ')'.

The other attributes (`i` and `s[i]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`, and `balance` set to 3 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -1. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to the same value as the first object's `balance`, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`. The third `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to the same value as the first object's `balance`, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`.**
