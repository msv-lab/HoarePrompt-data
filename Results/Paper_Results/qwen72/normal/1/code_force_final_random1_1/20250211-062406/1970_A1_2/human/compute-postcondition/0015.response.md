The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, meaning `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`, and `balance` set to 2 if the third character of `s` is '(', otherwise `balance` is set to -2. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `balance` set to the same value as the first object's `balance`, `i` set to 2, and `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`.**
