Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s` and remains unchanged. `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object. Each `BalanceInfo` object in the list corresponds to an index `i` in the string `s`, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. For each `BalanceInfo` object, `i` is the index in the string, `s[i]` is the character at that index, and `balance` is the cumulative balance of parentheses up to that index. The final value of `balance` will be 0 because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `balance_info` list will contain detailed information about the balance of parentheses at each position in the string `s`, and the overall balance will be 0, confirming that the sequence is balanced.
