Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least `max(da, max(max(d.values(), default=[])))`, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least `max(da, max(max(d.values(), default=[])))`, `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all elements `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and the length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`. Here, `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all elements `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function updates the `processing` and `rank` lists and returns an integer. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being 0), and sets `rank[da - 1]` to one more than the minimum value returned by these recursive calls. The function ultimately returns this updated value of `rank[da - 1]`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, and b is not equal to 0.

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: the second element (y) from the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, the result of the expression `x - a // b * y` where `x` is the first element from the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, and the third element (g) from the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple of three elements. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes and returns a tuple where the first element is the second element from a recursive call to `func_13(b, a % b)`, the second element is the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call), and the third element is the third element from the recursive call. The function effectively computes values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the specific relationship is not explicitly stated.

If `k != 1`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, and `i` is `l-1`.

    #The program returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`. If `k != 1`, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_7` to obtain two integers `n` and `k` such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. It then processes these values to generate a specific output. If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the string '1\n2'. For other values of `n` and `k` where `k == 1`, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k != 1`, it constructs a list `ans` starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. Finally, the function returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and during each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the console. After the function completes, the console will contain the output of `func_14()` for each iteration, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the console output.
