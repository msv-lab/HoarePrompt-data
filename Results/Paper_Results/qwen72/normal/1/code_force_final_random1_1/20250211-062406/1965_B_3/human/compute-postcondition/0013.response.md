Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 4, `k` is currently equal to the value returned by `func_7()` for `k`, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`, `i` is 4**. 

The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value `2 ** i` (which is 16, since `i` is 4) to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
