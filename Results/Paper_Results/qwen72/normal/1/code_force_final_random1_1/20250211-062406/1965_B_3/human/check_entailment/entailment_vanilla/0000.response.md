### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_14**: This function generates the required sequence based on the given `n` and `k`.
     - If `k == 1`, it handles the special case where `k` is 1.
     - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence using powers of 2 and specific adjustments to ensure the conditions are met.
   - **func_15**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - When `k == 1`, the function handles the edge case where `n == 2` separately.
   - For other values of `n`, it ensures that the sequence includes 2 and 3, and additional powers of 2 to cover all values up to `n`.

4. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `k > 1`, the function constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum condition is met.
   - Additional values like `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to cover the remaining range.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints the sequence in the required format, ensuring it meets the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates the required sequence for the given problem. It handles both special and general cases appropriately and ensures that the sequence meets all the specified conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
