The code snippet `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will now contain all its previous elements plus the new element `k + 1`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` is updated to include the new element `k + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)` and `k + 1`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
