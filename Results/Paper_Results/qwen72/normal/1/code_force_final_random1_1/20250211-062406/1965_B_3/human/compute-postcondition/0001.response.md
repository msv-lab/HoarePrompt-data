The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()`, followed by a newline character, to the standard output. This operation does not modify any variables directly, but it does execute `func_14()` and print its result.

Given the initial state that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged because the code snippet does not call `func_10()` or modify its behavior.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and the value of `func_14()` has been printed to the console.**
