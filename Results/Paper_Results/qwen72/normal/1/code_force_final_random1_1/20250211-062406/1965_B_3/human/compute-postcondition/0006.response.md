Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `func_14()` has been printed to the console for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that the function `func_10()` must return a value that is at least as large as the number of times the loop runs. For each iteration of the loop, the function `func_14()` is called, and its return value is printed to the console. After all iterations, the output will consist of the return values of `func_14()` printed on separate lines, one for each iteration.
