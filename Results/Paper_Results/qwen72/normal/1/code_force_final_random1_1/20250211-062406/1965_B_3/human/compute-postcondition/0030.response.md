Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and `2 ** lk`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is `lk`, `lk` must be less than `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is equal to `lk`, the value `2 ** lk` is appended to the list `ans`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
