You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns the string 'Bob'.
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The function does not modify the input variables and has no side effects.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing `t` values, each value being the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing all the values, each of which is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`), calls another function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The final state of the program is that `t` is the number of test cases processed, and the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case are printed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program provided seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The key insight is that the game is essentially about parity (odd or even). The function `func_1` checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game involves alternating moves where each player must remove a coin, and the player who cannot remove a coin loses. If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will always have a move after the first player (Alice), and vice versa if the total is odd. The provided test cases in the problem description align with this logic, and no counterexample can be found where the program fails to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.
