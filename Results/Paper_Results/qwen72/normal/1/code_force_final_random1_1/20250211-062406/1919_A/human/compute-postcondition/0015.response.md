To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
- `results` is a list containing `t` values, each value being the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which iterates over the elements of the list `results`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, the list `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not run.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0, which means `results` is an empty list because `results` contains `t` values, and `t` is 0.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `t` is 0, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1.
- Additionally, `results` should contain at least one value, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

### Final State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `results` must contain at least one value, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing at least one value, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.
