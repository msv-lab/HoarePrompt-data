The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two values, and `result` is the second value in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least three values, and `result` will be the third value in the list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing at least three values, the first of which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, and `result` is the third value in the list**
