### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their wallets.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the other or keep their own.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that the game is symmetric and deterministic. The outcome depends solely on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice will always be forced to leave an even number of coins after her turn, and Bob can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Alice.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of coins for Bob, and Bob will eventually be forced to leave an even number of coins for Alice.

3. **Explanation of the Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function determines the winner based on the sum of the coins. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'. This function correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - **func_2():** This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. The function correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct because the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob will always win; if the sum is odd, Alice will always win.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Final: **True**
