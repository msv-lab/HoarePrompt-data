Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list containing at least one value, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

However, the code snippet you provided is:

```python
print(result)
```

This code snippet attempts to print a variable named `result`, but there is no variable named `result` mentioned in the initial state. Instead, the initial state mentions a list named `results`.

Given this discrepancy, it's likely that the intended variable to print is the first element of the `results` list, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Therefore, the correct interpretation of the code snippet should be:

```python
print(results[0])
```

### Explanation:
- `results` is a list containing at least one value.
- The first element of `results` is the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.

### Output:
Output: **the result of `func_1(a, b)` (where `a` and `b` are the arguments passed to `func_1`)**

This means that the print statement will output the value returned by the function `func_1(a, b)`. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, the output will be the result of the function call with those specific arguments.
