Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list containing at least two values.
- The first value in `results` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `result` is the second value in the list `results`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the second value in the list `results`.
