Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The core of the problem lies in understanding the parity of the total number of coins. The game's rules dictate that players take turns removing one coin, and the player who cannot make a move loses. Given that each player must remove a coin on their turn, the game essentially reduces to a parity problem. If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then Bob (the second player) will always have a move after Alice (the first player), leading to Bob's victory. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always have the last move, leading to her victory. The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases as specified, ensuring that the input constraints are respected and the results are printed correctly. The provided test cases in the problem description also align with the expected outcomes based on the parity logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
