Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program provided seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The key insight is that the game is essentially about parity (odd or even). The function `func_1` checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game involves alternating moves where each player must remove a coin, and the player who cannot remove a coin loses. If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will always have a move after the first player (Alice), and vice versa if the total is odd. The provided test cases in the problem description align with this logic, and no counterexample can be found where the program fails to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.
