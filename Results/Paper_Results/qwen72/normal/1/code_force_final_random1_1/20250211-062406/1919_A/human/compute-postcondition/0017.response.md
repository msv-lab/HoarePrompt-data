The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If there is another element in `results`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing at least one value, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two values, and `result` will be the second value in the list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing at least two values, the first of which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, and `result` is the second value in the list**
