The value of `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user when prompted with 'Enter the number of test cases: '. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, the new value of `t` must also satisfy this condition. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and still satisfy their respective conditions.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value entered by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
