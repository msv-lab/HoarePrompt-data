The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`), calls another function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The final state of the program is that `t` is the number of test cases processed, and the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case are printed.
