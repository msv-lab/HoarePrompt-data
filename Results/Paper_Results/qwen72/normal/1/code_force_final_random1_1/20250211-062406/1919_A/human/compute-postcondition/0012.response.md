Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0, decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
- The variable `winner` is updated to the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- The list `results` now contains the previous value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it.
