The code appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Since `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, and `results` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `results` will contain one element which is the value of `winner`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
