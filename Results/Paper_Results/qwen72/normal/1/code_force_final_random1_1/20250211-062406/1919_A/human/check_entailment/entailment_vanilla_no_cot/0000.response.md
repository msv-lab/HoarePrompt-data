Correctness: **True**

The provided solution is correct based on the problem description. The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. This works because:

- If the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is even, the game will end in a situation where both players have an equal number of moves left, and since Bob plays second, he will always be the one to make the last move, hence winning the game.
- If the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is odd, the game will end with one player having one more move than the other, and since Alice plays first, she will be the one to make the last move, hence winning the game.

The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and then processing each case individually, calling `func_1` to determine the winner for each case and printing the results. This matches the expected input and output format as described in the problem statement.
