### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be divided into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which represents the minimum number of pieces.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop.
   - If consecutive characters are different, it increments `count`.
   - If the transition from '0' to '1' is found, it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly identifies transitions between different characters and counts them.
   - The decrement of `count` when `flag` is `True` ensures that we do not overcount the transition from '0' to '1'.
   - The final `count` value is printed for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For a string with only '0's or only '1's, the `count` remains 1, which is correct.
   - For a string like "10", the `count` is 2, which is correct.
   - For a string like "0110", the `count` is 2, which is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem's requirements.
