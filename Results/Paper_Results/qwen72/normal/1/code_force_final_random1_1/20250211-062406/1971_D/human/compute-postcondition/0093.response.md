Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It calculates the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different, adjusting the count if a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the adjusted counts have been printed for each input string `s`. **
