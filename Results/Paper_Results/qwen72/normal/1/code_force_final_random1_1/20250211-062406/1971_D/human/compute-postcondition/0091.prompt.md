Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is decreased by 1 and `flag` remains True. Otherwise, `count` and `flag` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different. If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 1, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` consists of '0' followed by '1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, and `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of positions where `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]` plus 1. If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 2, and `flag` remains True, indicating that there exists at least one position `j` such that `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1'. If `flag` is False, `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
