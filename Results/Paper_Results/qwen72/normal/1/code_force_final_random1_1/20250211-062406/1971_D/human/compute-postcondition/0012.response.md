Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `count` is 2. Additionally, if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` remains False. If `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]`, `count` remains 1 and `flag` remains False.***
