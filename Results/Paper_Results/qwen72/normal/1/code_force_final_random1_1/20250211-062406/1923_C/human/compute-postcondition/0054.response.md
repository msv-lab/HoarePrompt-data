The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. This operation updates the value of `l`.

The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**
