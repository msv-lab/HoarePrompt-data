The code snippet `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]` calculates the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]` using the precomputed cumulative sums stored in the list `p`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1.
   - `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed.
   - `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
   - `i` is the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.
   - `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The variable `s` is assigned the value `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
   - This calculation uses the cumulative sums in `p` to find the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `p[b]` gives the cumulative sum up to index `b` in `l`.
   - `p[a - 1]` gives the cumulative sum up to index `a - 1` in `l`.
   - The difference `p[b] - p[a - 1]` gives the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - The new variable `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**
