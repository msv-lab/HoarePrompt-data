The only variable in the loop head is `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`m` is greater than 0 but less than its current value, `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then these conditions hold true. Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
