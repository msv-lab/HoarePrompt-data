The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` was initially `[0]`, and `j` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether the first element of `l` is `1` or not. After appending `j` to `c`, the new value of `c` will be `[0, j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least one element, `c` is `[0, j]`, `j` is 0 if the first element of `l` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 1, and `x` is the first element of `l`.**
