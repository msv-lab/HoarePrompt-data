Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` starting with 0, `c` is a list containing the cumulative counts of 1s in `l` starting with 0, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
