Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that index, starting with 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of 1s in `l` up to that index, starting with 0, `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: This variable accumulates the sum of all elements in the list `l` as the loop iterates through each element.
- **`s`**: This variable remains as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, which is the difference between the cumulative sums at indices `b` and `a - 1` in the list `p`.
- **`p`**: This list starts with `[0]` and appends the cumulative sum of elements in `l` at each iteration. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3]`, then `p` will be `[0, 1, 3, 6]`.
- **`c`**: This list starts with `[0]` and appends the cumulative count of 1s in `l` at each iteration. For example, if `l = [1, 0, 1, 1]`, then `c` will be `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`.
- **`j`**: This variable counts the total number of 1s in the list `l`.

The final state of these variables reflects the complete execution of the loop over all elements in the list `l`.
