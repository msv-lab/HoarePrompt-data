Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \ \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers that have been processed.
- `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, representing the count of `1`s between indices `a` and `b` in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, with `b` being greater than 0.
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a` and `b` in `l`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
