Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it should be correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `c`, the array itself, and the queries. This is done using standard input methods, which is appropriate for the problem.

2. **Prefix Sums and Counters**:
   - `p` is a prefix sum array where `p[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`.
   - `c` is a prefix count array where `c[i]` stores the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `l`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1:b]` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It also calculates the number of 1s in the subarray using the prefix count array `c`.
   - The condition for a subarray to be "good" is checked:
     - The subarray must have at least two elements (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray must be greater than or equal to the number of 1s in the subarray (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

4. **Output**:
   - If the conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic and the implementation seem to align with the problem requirements. The use of prefix sums and counts allows for efficient query processing, and the conditions checked are consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
