Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers derived from `input().split()`, `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`.** 

The code initializes a new list `c` with a single element `[0]`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
