Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`.** 

Explanation: The variables `i` and `j` are both reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
