Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `c` is `[0]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 â‰¤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least one element, `c` is `[0, j]`, `j` is 0 if the first element of `l` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 1, and `x` is the first element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the first element of `l` plus the second element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least two elements, `c` is `[0, j, j]`, `j` is 1 if the first element of `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` is the second element of `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the sum of the first and second elements of `l` plus the third element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input with at least three elements, `c` is `[0, j, j, j]`, `j` is 1 if the first element of `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` is the third element of `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
