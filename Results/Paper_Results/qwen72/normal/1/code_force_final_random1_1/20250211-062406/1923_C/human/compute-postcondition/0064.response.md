The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, and `c` initially contains a single element `[0]`. After appending `j` (which is 0) to `c`, the list `c` will contain two elements: `[0, 0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**
