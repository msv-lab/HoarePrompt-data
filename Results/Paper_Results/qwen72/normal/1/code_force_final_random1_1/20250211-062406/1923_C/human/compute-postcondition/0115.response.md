Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the first element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least one element, `c` is `[0]`, `j` is 0 if the first element of `l` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 1, and `x` is the first element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is the first element of `l`) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` was `[0]`, so after appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
