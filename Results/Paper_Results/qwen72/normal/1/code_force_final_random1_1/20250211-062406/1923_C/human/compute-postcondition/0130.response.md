To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
- `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that index, starting with 0.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of 1s in `l` up to that index, starting with 0.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `m`.
- The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `p`, `l`, `c`, `j`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
