Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Additionally, the difference `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1, and the expression `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.**
