You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [0]
        c = [0]
        (i, j) = (0, 0)
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition is met within a specified range of the list and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function reads input from the user for the number of test cases, the size of the list, the list itself, and the queries. It maintains internal state for each test case but resets it for the next test case. The final state after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' responses have been printed for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists another array `b` such that the sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`, and no element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`, and all elements in `b` are greater than 0. For a subarray with a single element, it's impossible to construct such a `b` because the only way to keep the sums equal while changing the element would violate the condition that all elements in `b` must be greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `a`.

Example Input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 1
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
NO
YES
NO
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "YES" for the subarray `c[1:1]` which should be "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot meet the conditions specified in the problem description.
