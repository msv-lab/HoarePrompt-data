The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`
- `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element
- `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i + x, i]`
- `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j]`
- `i` is incremented by `x`
- `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2
- `x` is the next element in `l`

After executing `c.append(j)`, the value of `j` (which is either 3 or 2 based on the value of `x`) is appended to the list `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one more element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i, i + x, i]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j, j, j]`, `i` is incremented by `x`, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 2, and `x` is the next element in `l`.**
