The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `j` is 1 if `x` (the second element in the list `l`) is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0, the new value of `j` will be 2 if `x` is 1, or 1 if `x` is not 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, 1, 1 + x]`, `c` is `[0, 0, j]`, `i` is `1 + x`, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`.**
