Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, and `x` is 1.**
