Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
