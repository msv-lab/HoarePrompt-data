Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.
   - `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed.
   - `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
   - `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are updated with new input values.
   - `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
