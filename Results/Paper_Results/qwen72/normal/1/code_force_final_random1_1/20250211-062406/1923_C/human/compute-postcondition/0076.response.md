The value of `i` is `1 + 2*x`, and this value is appended to the list `p`. The list `p` initially contains `[0, 1, 1 + x]`, so after appending `i`, the list `p` becomes `[0, 1, 1 + x, 1 + 2*x]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, 1, 1 + x, 1 + 2*x]`, `c` is `[0, 0, j]`, `i` is `1 + 2*x`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`. If `x` is 1, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `j` remains 1.**
