The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 1, and `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will have the new values provided by the user. The condition \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) may or may not be satisfied depending on the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are the integers provided by the user input.**
