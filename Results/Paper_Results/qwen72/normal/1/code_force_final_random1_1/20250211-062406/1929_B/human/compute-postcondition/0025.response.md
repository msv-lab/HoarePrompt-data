Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from the second line of the input, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
- `s` is the next line in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(2 * n)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `n` is an integer derived from the second line of the input.
- The expression `2 * n` calculates twice the value of `n`.
- Since `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, the value of `2 * n` will be within the range 4 ≤ 2 * n ≤ 2 * 10^8.

### Output:
Output: **2 * n (where n is the integer derived from the second line of the input and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8)**
