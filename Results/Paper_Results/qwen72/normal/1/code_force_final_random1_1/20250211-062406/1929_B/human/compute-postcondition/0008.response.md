The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. The loop iterates `t` times, and the value of `t` determines how many times the loop will run.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since `_` is incremented implicitly by the `range(t)` function, the effective state change is that `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop is still running).
- The value of `t` is effectively one less than it was at the start of the previous iteration, but this is not explicitly represented in the state because the loop variable `_` does not capture this decrement directly.

Since `n` and `k` are not modified by the loop head and their relationship to the equation \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) remains unchanged, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input. If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation. Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.**
