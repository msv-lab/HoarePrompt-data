Output State: **`t` is 0, all `n` and `k` values provided by the user have been processed. For each pair of `n` and `k`, if \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), the output was \(k // 2 + 1\). Otherwise, the output was `ceil(k / 2)`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` were used to determine the output based on the conditions specified in the loop. If \(4 \times n - 2\) was equal to `k`, the output was \(k // 2 + 1\). Otherwise, the output was the ceiling of \(k / 2\).
