To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `j` is initialized to `l-1`.
2. `l` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. `ans` is a list that is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `j` and `l`:**
   - `j` starts at `l-1` and decrements to 0.
   - `l` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Updating `ans`:**
   - For each value of `j` from `l-1` to 0, the expression `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` is evaluated and appended to `ans`.
   - `rev_array[j:]` is a slice of `rev_array` starting from index `j` to the end.
   - `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])` counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the slice `rev_array[j:]`.
   - `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` selects an element from the list `alp` based on the count minus one.

3. **Final Print Statement:**
   - `''.join(map(str, ans))` converts each element of `ans` to a string and joins them together into a single string.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `rev_array = [1, 2, 1, 3]` and `alp = ['a', 'b', 'c']`.
- `l = len(rev_array) = 4`.

#### Iteration 1:
- `j = 3`
- `rev_array[3:] = [3]`
- `rev_array[3].count(3) = 1`
- `alp[1 - 1] = alp[0] = 'a'`
- `ans = ['a']`

#### Iteration 2:
- `j = 2`
- `rev_array[2:] = [1, 3]`
- `rev_array[2].count(1) = 1`
- `alp[1 - 1] = alp[0] = 'a'`
- `ans = ['a', 'a']`

#### Iteration 3:
- `j = 1`
- `rev_array[1:] = [2, 1, 3]`
- `rev_array[1].count(2) = 1`
- `alp[1 - 1] = alp[0] = 'a'`
- `ans = ['a', 'a', 'a']`

#### Iteration 4:
- `j = 0`
- `rev_array[0:] = [1, 2, 1, 3]`
- `rev_array[0].count(1) = 2`
- `alp[2 - 1] = alp[1] = 'b'`
- `ans = ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b']`

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will join the elements of `ans` into a single string:
```python
''.join(map(str, ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b']))
```
This results in the string `"aaaab"`.

### General Case:
Without specific values for `rev_array` and `alp`, the output will depend on the contents of these lists. However, the general form of the output will be a string constructed by the elements of `ans` as described.

### Final Answer:
Output: **''.join(map(str, ans)) (where ans is a list constructed by appending alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1] for each j from l-1 to 0)**
