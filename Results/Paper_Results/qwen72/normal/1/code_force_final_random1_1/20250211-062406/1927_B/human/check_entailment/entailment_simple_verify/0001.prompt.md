You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), representing the trace of the string.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each element being the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, `i` is `t`, `j` is `l-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**:
   - An alphabet list `alp` containing all lowercase Latin letters is initialized.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The trace array `array` is reversed to facilitate the counting process from the end of the array.

4. **Constructing the Answer**:
   - For each element in the reversed array, the function counts how many times the current element appears in the remaining part of the array.
   - It then appends the corresponding letter from the alphabet list to the answer list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed string by joining the elements of `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Trace Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `a` represents the number of previous occurrences of the same character up to the current position.
  - By reversing the array, the function can count the occurrences of each value from the end, which helps in determining the correct character to use.

- **Character Selection**:
  - The function uses the count of the current value in the remaining part of the reversed array to select the appropriate character from the alphabet.
  - This approach ensures that the characters are selected in the correct order based on their frequency.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with all zeros in the trace array correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs a string from its trace array by reversing the array and using the count of each value to select the appropriate character. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
