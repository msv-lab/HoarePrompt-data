Output State: **`alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabets, `j` is `l-1`, `l` is the new input integer, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `l`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. The values of `alp`, `j`, `l`, `i`, `array`, and `rev_array` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` is now an empty list.
