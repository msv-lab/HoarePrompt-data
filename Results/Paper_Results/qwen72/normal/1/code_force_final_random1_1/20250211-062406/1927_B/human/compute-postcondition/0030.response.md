Output State: **`j` is `l-1` where `l` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input integer, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`, `i` is `l` which is the new input integer, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `j` is `l-1`, `l` is the new input integer, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`, and `i` is `l`.
- The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `array`.
- The values of `j`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
- The new variable `array` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
