Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and now equals the value input by the user, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each element being the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, `j` is `l-1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value from `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `i`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `array`.
- The initial state mentions that `array` is a list of integers read from the input, and this code snippet confirms that.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `rev_array`, `ans`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged or their conditions are still valid as described in the initial state.
