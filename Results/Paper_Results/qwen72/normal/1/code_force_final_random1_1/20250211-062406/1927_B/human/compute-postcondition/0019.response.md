Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and now equals the value input by the user, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is `l-1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value from `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
