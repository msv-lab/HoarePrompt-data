Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` must be greater than 2, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[0]` in `rev_array[0:]` minus 1, the second element is the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[1]` in `rev_array[1:]` minus 1, and the third element is the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` minus 1, `j` is 2.**
