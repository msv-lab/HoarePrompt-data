The code snippet initializes a list `alp` containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, or `array`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `alp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers read from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
