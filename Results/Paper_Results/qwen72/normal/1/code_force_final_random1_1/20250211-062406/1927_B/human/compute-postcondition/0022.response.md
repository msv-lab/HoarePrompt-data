The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `l` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[0:].count(rev_array[0]) - 1]`**
