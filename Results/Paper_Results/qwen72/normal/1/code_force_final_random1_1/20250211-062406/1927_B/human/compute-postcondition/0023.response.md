Output State: **`j` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` remains 1.
- The value of `l` remains greater than 1.
- The list `ans` is updated by appending the value `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`. This means that the element at index `j` in `rev_array` is counted in the sublist starting from index `j` to the end of `rev_array`, and the count minus one is used as the index to access an element in `alp`, which is then appended to `ans`.
