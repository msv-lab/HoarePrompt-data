Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as a list of integers, `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`. The variable `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.**

To break it down:
- `arr`: Remains the same as the initial list of integers.
- `ans`: Contains the products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order. Specifically, the last element of `ans` will be the product of all elements in `arr`.
- `tem`: Is the product of all elements in `arr`.
- `i`: Is -1, which means the loop has finished executing.
