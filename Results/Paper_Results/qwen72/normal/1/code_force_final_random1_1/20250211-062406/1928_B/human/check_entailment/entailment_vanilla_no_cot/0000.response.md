Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions defined do not perform the operations required to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. Specifically, the program lacks any logic to:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determine the optimal permutation to add to the array to maximize the frequency of any single element.
4. Output the result for each test case.

The functions provided seem to be utility functions for reading input and performing basic operations, but they do not form a complete solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect with respect to the problem statement.
