The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `len(arr) - 2`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be `len(arr) - 2`
- `arr` must have at least 2 elements (since `i` is now `len(arr) - 2` and must be non-negative).

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**
