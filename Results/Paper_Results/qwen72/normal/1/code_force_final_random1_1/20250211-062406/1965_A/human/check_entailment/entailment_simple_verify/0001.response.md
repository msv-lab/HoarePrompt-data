### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which is intended to track the current player (Alice or Bob).
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The first element being 1 or not does not determine the winner. This is a significant flaw in the logic.
   - It creates a sorted set of unique elements from `arr`.
   - It iterates through the sorted set and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If so, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - It toggles the value of `A` for each element in the set.
   - If `not_c` is `True`, it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The first element being 1 or not does not determine the winner. The game logic depends on the entire array and the optimal moves.
   - The logic for checking the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set is also flawed. The game is about removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, not just checking the differences between elements.
   - The toggling of `A` and the use of `not_c` do not correctly simulate the game's rules. The correct approach should involve the Nim Game or Sprague-Grundy theorem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves using the concept of the Nim Game. The key is to calculate the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program has logical errors in determining the winner of the game. The correct approach should involve calculating the XOR of all pile sizes to determine the winner based on the principles of the Nim Game.

Final: **False**
