Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. The loop has iterated over the range from 1 to the length of `lis` (exclusive), and the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is at most 1. Therefore, `test` is currently True. Additionally, the length of `lis` is even.**
