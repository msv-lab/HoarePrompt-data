Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is the opposite of its previous value (if it was True, now it is False, and vice versa); `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, including 1; `i` is the last index of `set_` that was processed before the loop ended; `not_c` is True, indicating that there are no two consecutive elements in `set_` such that their difference is greater than 1. If `not_c` is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
