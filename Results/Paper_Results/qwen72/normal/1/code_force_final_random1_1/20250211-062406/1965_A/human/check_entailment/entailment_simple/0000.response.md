### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the list `arr` as an argument.

3. **Initial Check**: Inside `func_1`, the program checks if the first element of `arr` is not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This check is incorrect because it only considers the first element of the array, which may not be representative of the entire game state.

4. **Set and Sorting**: The program creates a set of unique elements from `arr` and sorts it. This step is intended to identify the distinct values in the array and their order.

5. **Loop Through Set**: The program iterates through the sorted set to check if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If such a difference is found, the variable `not_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, the variable `A` is toggled.

6. **Final Check**: After the loop, if `not_c` is still `True`, `A` is toggled again. Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise.

### Issues:

- **Initial Check**: The initial check `if (arr[0] != 1)` is flawed. It only checks the first element of the array, which is not sufficient to determine the game outcome. The game outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles and the distribution of stones, not just the first element.

- **Set and Sorting**: While creating a set and sorting it helps in identifying the unique values and their order, the logic for determining the winner based on these values is incorrect. The game's outcome should be determined by the parity of the number of piles and the distribution of stones, not just the differences between consecutive elements.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

- If the number of piles is odd, Alice wins.
- If the number of piles is even, Bob wins.

This is because the game is essentially a Nim game where the player who makes the last move wins. The key is to determine the parity of the number of piles.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed initial check and the incorrect logic for determining the winner.

**Correctness: **False**
