Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the game theory problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from piles, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The logic implemented in `func_1` is intended to determine the winner based on the properties of the piles.

However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Initial Check for `arr[0] != 1`**: The function checks if the first element of the array is not 1 and immediately returns 'Alice' if it is not. This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the entire configuration of the piles, not just the first pile. For example, if the first pile has 2 stones and the rest have 1 stone, Alice would still lose if she cannot make a valid move.

2. **Handling of Unique Values**: The function converts the list to a set, sorts it, and then checks the differences between consecutive elements. This approach is intended to determine if the piles can be reduced in such a way that the game state alternates between Alice and Bob. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the game's rules, especially when there are multiple piles with different sizes.

3. **Alternation Logic**: The alternation logic (`A = not A`) is applied based on the differences between consecutive unique values. This is not a correct way to determine the winner because the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of moves that can be made, not just the differences between pile sizes.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases well, such as when all piles have the same number of stones or when the number of piles is very large.

Given these issues, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game logic and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
