Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the program maintains these conditions. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` indicates whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially.**

Explanation:
- The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` transforms `l` into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the resulting set to create a new list `lis`.
- The initial state specifies that `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, so `lis` will be a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- The conditions regarding `t`, `i`, `n`, and the properties of `lis` (whether 1 is in `lis`, the length of `lis`, and the `test` condition) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
