### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track the current player (Alice or Bob).
   - **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The first element being 1 or not does not necessarily determine the winner. The game logic depends on the entire array and the optimal moves.
   - **Set Creation and Sorting**: It creates a sorted set of unique elements from `arr`. This step is unnecessary for the correct solution.
   - **Difference Check**: It iterates through the sorted set and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If so, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop. This logic is flawed because the game is about removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, not just checking the differences between elements.
   - **Toggling `A`**: It toggles the value of `A` for each element in the set. This is also incorrect because it does not follow the optimal strategy for the game.
   - **Final Toggle**: If `not_c` is `True`, it toggles `A` one more time. This is another incorrect step.
   - **Return Statement**: Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The first element being 1 or not does not determine the winner. The game logic depends on the entire array and the optimal moves.
   - The logic for checking the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set is also flawed. The game is about removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, not just checking the differences between elements.
   - The toggling of `A` and the use of `not_c` do not follow the optimal strategy for the game.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves using the concept of the Nim Game or Sprague-Grundy theorem. The key is to calculate the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program has logical errors in determining the winner of the game. The correct approach should involve calculating the XOR of all pile sizes to determine the winner based on the principles of the Nim Game.

Final: **False**
