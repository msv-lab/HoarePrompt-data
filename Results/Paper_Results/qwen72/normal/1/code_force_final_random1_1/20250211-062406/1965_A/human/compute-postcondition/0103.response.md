Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2. If the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True, and the index `j` remains either odd or even as it was initially.***
