The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is greater than 1.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
  - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements.
  - `j` is 3.
  - `test` remains True.

- **Code Snippet:**
  - The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'` to the console.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
