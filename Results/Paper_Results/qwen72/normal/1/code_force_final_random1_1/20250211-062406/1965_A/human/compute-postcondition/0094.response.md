Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, and the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1. Additionally, if `j` is odd, the index `j` remains odd. If `j` is even, the index `j` remains even.**
