Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If any two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, `test` is False. However, since the if condition is met, `test` is currently True, indicating that all consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference of at most 1.**
