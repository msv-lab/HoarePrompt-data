Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last integer input by the user, `a` is the last string input by the user, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'. If the loop broke due to the condition being met, the program printed 'No' and moved on to the next test case.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `_` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last test case, and `i` will be the last odd number less than `n` from the last test case. The program will have printed 'yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
