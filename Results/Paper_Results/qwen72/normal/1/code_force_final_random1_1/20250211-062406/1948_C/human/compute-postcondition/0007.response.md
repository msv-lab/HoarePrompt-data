Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `a` is a string input by the user.
- `b` is a string input by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` must be true.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'No'`.
- The conditions mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
