Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program prints 'yes' after the loop completes.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number less than `n`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current index `i` plus one is less than `n` and if the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are met.
- If any of these conditions are true, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
- If none of these conditions are true for any iteration, the loop completes, and the program prints 'yes'.
- After all iterations, `i` will be the last odd number less than `n`. If `n` is even, `i` will be `n - 1`. If `n` is odd, `i` will be `n - 2`.
