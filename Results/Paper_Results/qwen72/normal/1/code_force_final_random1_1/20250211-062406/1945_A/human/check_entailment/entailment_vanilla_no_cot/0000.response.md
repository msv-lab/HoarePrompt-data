Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem statement:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Universals**: The line `b += c` assumes that all universals can be used to fill the requirements of extroverts. However, this is not always optimal. Universals should be used to balance the needs of both introverts and extroverts, but the current approach does not consider this balance properly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents**: The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not clear and does not correctly handle the conditions for determining the number of tents. Specifically, the use of `- -b // 3` and the condition `c < b % 3` are not logically sound for the problem's requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when it is impossible to satisfy the conditions (e.g., when there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals).

A correct solution should:
- Ensure that each introvert gets a tent.
- Try to pair extroverts with universals to form groups of 3.
- Use remaining universals to form groups of 1, 2, or 3 as needed.
- Check if it is possible to form the required groups and return the minimum number of tents or -1 if it is not possible.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Introverts need their own tents
        tents = a
        
        # Extroverts need to be in groups of 3
        if b * 3 > c + a:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Use universals to form groups of 3 with extroverts
        c -= min(c, b * 2)
        b = max(0, b - c // 2)
        
        # Remaining extroverts need to be paired with universals
        if b > 0:
            if c >= b * 2:
                c -= b * 2
            else:
                results.append(-1)
                continue
        
        # Remaining universals can be used to form groups of 1, 2, or 3
        tents += (b + c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that the conditions for introverts, extroverts, and universals are handled correctly and efficiently.
