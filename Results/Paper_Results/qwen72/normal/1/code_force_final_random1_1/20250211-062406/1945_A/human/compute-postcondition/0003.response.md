Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- These values are updated to the integers parsed from the first line of the input provided to `open(0)`.
- After the update, `b` is equal to the original value of `b` plus the original value of `c`.

### Code Execution:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Update Values:**
   - Let the original values of `a`, `b`, and `c` be denoted as `a_original`, `b_original`, and `c_original`.
   - After reading from the input, the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are set to these parsed integers.
   - The value of `b` is then updated to `b_original + c_original`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - This is a ternary-like operation in Python, where the value of the expression depends on the condition `c < b % 3`.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - `b % 3` is the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - `c < b % 3` checks if `c` is less than this remainder.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `a - -b // 3`.

4. **Expression Calculation:**
   - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because `--b` is equivalent to `b`.
   - `b // 3` is the integer division of `b` by 3.

### Final Output:
- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `-1`.
- If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `a + b // 3`.

### Conclusion:
The final output depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after they are updated from the input. Specifically, it depends on whether `c` is less than the remainder of `b` when divided by 3.

Output: **(a + b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3] (where a, b, and c are the updated values from the input, and b is the original value of b plus the original value of c)**
