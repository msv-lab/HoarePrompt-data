The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input (stdin), where each line contains three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each line, it updates `b` by adding `c` to it, then computes and prints a value based on the condition `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`. After processing all lines, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those from the last line of the input, with `b` being the sum of the original `b` and `c` from that line. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the computed results for each line of input.
