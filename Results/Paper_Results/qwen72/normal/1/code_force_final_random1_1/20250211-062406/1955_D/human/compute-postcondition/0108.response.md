Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Initially, `curr` was 0 if `cnt_b[a[0]]` was less than 0, otherwise it was 1. After the increment, `curr` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
