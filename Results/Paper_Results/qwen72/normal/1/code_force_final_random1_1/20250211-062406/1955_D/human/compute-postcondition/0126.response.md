Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1 (based on the condition involving `curr` and `k`). If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is now `curr - 1`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
