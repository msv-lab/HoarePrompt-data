The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state indicates that all elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. These conditions remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.**
