To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions and variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

This loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state before the loop (t, n, m, k, a, b, max_val, cnt_b) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
