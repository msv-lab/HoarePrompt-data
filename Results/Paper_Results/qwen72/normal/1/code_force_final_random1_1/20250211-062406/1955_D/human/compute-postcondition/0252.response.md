Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` as inputs. It calculates the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements match elements in `b` and their counts in `cnt_b` are non-negative. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values. The list `cnt_b` is reset to zero for all elements in `b_values`. **
