Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `curr` with its value set to 0.
