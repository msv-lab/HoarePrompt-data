Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, and `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution. The `cnt_b` dictionary reflects the final counts of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values`, and `curr` is adjusted based on the changes in `cnt_b` throughout the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` must contain at least one element, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the element in the list `cnt_b` at the index `i`. Since `i` is the third element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` was already 0, the assignment does not change the value of `cnt_b[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`b_values` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
