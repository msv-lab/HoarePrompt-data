Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state conditions regarding `b_values` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. The new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the user input.
