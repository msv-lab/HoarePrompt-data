### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting for Array `b`:**
   - The function updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

3. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to count the number of matching elements in the first subsegment of length `m` from array `a`.
   - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in this subsegment and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window, it also updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after updating, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to prepare for the next test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b` for each test case.

- **Frequency Counting:**
  - The function correctly updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

- **Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The function correctly initializes `curr` to count the number of matching elements in the first subsegment of length `m` from array `a`.
  - It correctly decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in this subsegment and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
  - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it correctly increments the answer `ans`.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - The function correctly uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
  - It correctly updates `cnt_b` and `curr` for each new element added to the window and each element removed from the window.
  - It correctly increments the answer `ans` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after updating.

- **Resetting Counts:**
  - The function correctly resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to prepare for the next test case.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the initialization, input reading, frequency counting, initial subsegment check, sliding window, and resetting counts accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
