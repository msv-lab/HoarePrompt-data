The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1**
