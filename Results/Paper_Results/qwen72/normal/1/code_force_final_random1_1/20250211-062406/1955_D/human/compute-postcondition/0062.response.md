The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` was initially 0. After executing the code, `ans` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. Otherwise, `curr` remains the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 1.**
