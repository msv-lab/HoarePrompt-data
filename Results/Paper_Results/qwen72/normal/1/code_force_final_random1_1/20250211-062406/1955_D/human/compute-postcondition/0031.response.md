Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[2]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `cnt_b[a[2]]` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.***
