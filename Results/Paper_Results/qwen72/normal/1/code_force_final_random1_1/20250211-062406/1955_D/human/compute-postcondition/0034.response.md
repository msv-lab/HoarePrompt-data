Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
