Postcondition: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, if `a[j]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[j]]` has been decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[j]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement, `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
