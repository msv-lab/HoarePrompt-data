The only object in the loop head is the range generated by `int(input())`, which dictates how many times the loop will execute. Since the loop is controlled by an input value, the state of the loop itself does not depend on the variables inside the loop body but rather on the input value provided.

At the end of the previous iteration, all elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0. However, this information is not relevant to the loop head, as the loop's continuation is solely determined by the number of iterations specified by the input.

For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must allow for another iteration. Since the input value is not modified within the loop (as per the given information), the state of the loop head remains dependent on the initial input value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the objects in the loop head, remains unchanged from the perspective of the loop control mechanism.

State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, the loop will execute based on the input value provided before the loop starts.**
