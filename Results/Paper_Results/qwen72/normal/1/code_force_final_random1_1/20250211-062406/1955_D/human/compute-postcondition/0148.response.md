Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2 or 3, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. If `curr` was less than `k`, `ans` is 1, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[2]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `curr` is now `curr - 1`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[1 + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is now `curr + 1`. If `a[1 + m]` is not in `b_values`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
