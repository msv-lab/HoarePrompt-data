Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the counts of elements in `b`. This is done outside the loop for efficiency, but it is reset for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to reflect the counts of elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check**:
   - It checks the first window of size `m` in `a` to see how many elements match elements in `b` and have non-negative counts.
   - If the count of matching elements is at least `k`, it increments the answer.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - It slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates the count and checks if the current window is good.
   - For each element removed from the window, it updates the count accordingly.

5. **Resetting Counts**:
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to ensure the next test case starts with a clean state.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the logic matches the problem requirements. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, maintaining the integrity of the input data and producing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
