To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from input.
- `i` is `m-1`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations.
- If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n - m`.
- For the loop to execute, `n - m` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than `m`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `n - m` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than `m`.
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

### State:
**`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
