The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `b_values` list. If there are more elements in `b_values`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, and `b_values` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the next (second) element in `b_values`.

State: **`i` is the next (second) element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least two elements, `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
