Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1 or 2, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. If `curr` was less than `k`, `ans` remains 0, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, the count of `a[1]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `curr` is now `curr - 1`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is now `curr + 1`.**
