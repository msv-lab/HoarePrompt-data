Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decremented by 1, `ans` is set based on the conditions described in the initial state. If `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is non-negative, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative plus 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.***
