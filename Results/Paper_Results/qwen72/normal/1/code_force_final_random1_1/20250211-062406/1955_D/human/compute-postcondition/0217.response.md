The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than `m`
- `m` is the length of the list `b`
- `k` remains an input integer
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input
- `b` remains a list of integers read from the input
- `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative
- If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1
- If the count of `a[0]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1
- If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0
- If `a[0]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged
- If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1
- Additionally, the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`

After executing the code snippet `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, if `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, if the count of `a[0]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is now 2; otherwise, `ans` was initially 0 and is now 1, if `a[0]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged, if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
