The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is 2; otherwise, `curr` is 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 0.**
