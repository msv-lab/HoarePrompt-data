The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from input.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be greater than 0.

The value of `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
