Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `b`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, and the loop index `i` is `m-1`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `cnt_b` array will contain the count of each element in the `b` list. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged, and the loop index `i` will be one less than the length of the `b` list (`m-1`).
