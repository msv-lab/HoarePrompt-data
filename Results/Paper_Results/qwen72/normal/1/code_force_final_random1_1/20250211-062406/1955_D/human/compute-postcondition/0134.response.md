The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is 0 or 1, the new value of `ans` will be 1 or 2, respectively. All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 1 or 2, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged.**
