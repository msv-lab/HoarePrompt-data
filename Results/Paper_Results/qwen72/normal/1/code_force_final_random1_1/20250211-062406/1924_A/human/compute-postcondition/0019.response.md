The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Since `cur` was initially 0, the new value of `cur` will be `1 << cur_ss`. The value of `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97. For example, if the second character of `s` is 'b', then `cur_ss` would be 1 (since the ASCII value of 'b' is 98, and 98 - 97 = 1), and `cur` would become `1 << 1`, which is 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is `1 << (ASCII value of the second character of `s` - 97)`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.**
