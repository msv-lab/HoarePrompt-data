The value of `cur` is updated by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by `cur_ss` positions and then adding the result to the current value of `cur`. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', the exact value added to `cur` depends on the second character of `s`.

For example, if the second character of `s` is 'b', then `cur_ss` would be 1 (since the ASCII value of 'b' is 98 and the ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so 98 - 97 = 1). In this case, `1 << 1` equals 2, and `cur` would be incremented by 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`.**
