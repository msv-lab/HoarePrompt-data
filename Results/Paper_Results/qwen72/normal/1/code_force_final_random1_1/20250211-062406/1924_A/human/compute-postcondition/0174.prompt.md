You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; for each test case, n, k, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        ans = ''
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. The variable `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during all iterations of the loop. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the variable `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
