Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes the third character in `s`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0 and `ans` includes the third character in `s` repeated twice. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`.***
