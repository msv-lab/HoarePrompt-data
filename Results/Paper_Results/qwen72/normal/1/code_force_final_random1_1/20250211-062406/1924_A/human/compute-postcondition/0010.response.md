The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit at the position `cur_ss` in the integer `cur`. Given that `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97, and the bit at this position was initially not set (`cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`), the bit at this position is now set.

Therefore, the updated value of `cur` is `cur | 1 << cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `cur | 1 << cur_ss`, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97.**
