Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` remains unchanged or is incremented by `1 << cur_ss` depending on the condition.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `cur` may or may not change based on the condition: if the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
