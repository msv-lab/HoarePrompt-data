Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is equal to `1 << cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` was reset to 0 before the current operation, and `ans` includes the third character in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value.
- Since `cur` was previously reset to 0, the new value of `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`.
- All other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
