Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a few issues:

1. The logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s` is flawed. The current implementation uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters, but it does not correctly handle the formation of subsequences of length `n`.

2. The variable `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence, but it is reset to 0 after each complete set of `k` characters is found. This does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.

3. The construction of the string `ans` is not correct. It is supposed to be used to build a subsequence, but it is not being used in a way that ensures it forms a valid subsequence of length `n`.

4. The logic for generating a missing subsequence when the answer is "NO" is incorrect. The code attempts to append a character that is not present in the current bitmask, but this does not guarantee that the resulting string is a valid subsequence that is missing from `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
        all_possible = {''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)}
        
        # Check if each possible string is a subsequence of s
        def is_subsequence(x):
            it = iter(s)
            return all(c in it for c in x)
        
        for possible in all_possible:
            if not is_subsequence(possible):
                print('NO')
                print(possible)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" followed by that string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".
