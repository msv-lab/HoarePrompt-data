Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is 'c', `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, and if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `97 + 2 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
- All other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `i`, `k`, and the condition about breaking out of the loop) remain unchanged.
