Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.** 

Explanation: The variable `cur_ss` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of `ss` (which is the first character in the string `s`) minus the ASCII value of the character 'a'. This effectively gives the position of `ss` in the alphabet starting from 0 (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.). The initial conditions for `s` and `ss` remain unchanged.
