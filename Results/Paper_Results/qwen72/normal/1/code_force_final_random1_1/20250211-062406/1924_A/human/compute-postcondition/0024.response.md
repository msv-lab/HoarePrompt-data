The code snippet `ans += ss` attempts to concatenate the string `ss` to the string `ans`. However, `ss` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will raise a `NameError` because `ss` is not recognized.

Since the code raises an error, no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least two characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0.**
