Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
