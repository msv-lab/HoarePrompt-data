The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` using the expression `chr(ord('a') + i)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, the expression `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `97 + 1 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'` in ASCII.

Thus, `tmp` is assigned the value `'b'`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values specified in the initial state still hold true, except for the updated value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `cur` is 0 if the last character processed caused `cur` to reset, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that were not part of a complete set of `k` unique characters, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'b'.**
