Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). If the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to 1 << `cur_ss`, making the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` equal to 1.**
