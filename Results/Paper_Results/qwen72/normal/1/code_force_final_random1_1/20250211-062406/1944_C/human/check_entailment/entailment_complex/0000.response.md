Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the game between Alice and Bob, where they manipulate an array to achieve their respective goals of maximizing and minimizing the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The key part of the solution is the function `func_1`, which processes the array to determine the final score.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Count Frequencies**: The function uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - **Initialize Variables**: It initializes `start` to 0 and `vis` as an empty set to keep track of visited elements.
   - **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums` (i.e., its frequency is greater than 0).
     - It adds `start` to the `vis` set and decrements its frequency in `nums`.
     - It checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums` and has a non-zero frequency. If so, it decrements the frequency of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` does not exist or has a zero frequency, it prints `start + 1` and returns.
   - **Final Print**: If the loop exits normally (i.e., `nums.get(start, 0)` becomes 0), it prints `start`.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic of the function ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by always choosing the smallest available number that can be used to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
   - The use of the `Counter` and the loop structure correctly simulates the game's rules and ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the array might be small or contain repeated elements correctly.
   - The loop and conditions ensure that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop and always terminates with the correct MEX value.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
