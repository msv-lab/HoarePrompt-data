Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the game between Alice and Bob by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The key part of the solution is the function `func_1`, which processes the array to simulate the game and determine the MEX.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: This creates a counter object to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - `start = 0`: This initializes the variable `start` to 0, which will be used to track the current MEX candidate.
   - `vis = set()`: This initializes an empty set `vis` to keep track of the elements that have been processed.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums` and has a non-zero frequency.
   - `vis.add(start)`: Adds the current `start` value to the set `vis`.
   - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decreases the frequency of the current `start` value in `nums`.
   - The program then checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums` and has a non-zero frequency:
     - If so, it decreases the frequency of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
     - If not, it prints `start + 1` and returns, indicating that `start + 1` is the MEX of the array `c`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - If the loop exits due to `nums.get(start, 0)` being 0, the program prints `start` and terminates.

**Analysis**:
- The program correctly simulates the game by ensuring that Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice always tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it.
- The use of a counter and a set ensures that the program efficiently tracks the elements and their frequencies.
- The logic of decrementing the frequency of `start` and `start + 1` ensures that the game progresses correctly, and the MEX is determined accurately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in its approach and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
