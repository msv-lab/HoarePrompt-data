Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0.** 

Explanation: The variable `start` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`arr` and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
