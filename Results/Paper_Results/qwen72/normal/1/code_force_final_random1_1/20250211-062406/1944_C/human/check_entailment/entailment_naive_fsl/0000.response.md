Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic between Alice and Bob. Specifically, the algorithm does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly, and it does not consider the optimal strategies for both players.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code will output `2`, which is incorrect.

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- In the optimal game, Alice and Bob would play as follows:
  1. Alice picks `3` (since she wants to maximize the score). Now `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [3]`.
  2. Bob picks `2` (since he wants to minimize the score). Now `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [3]`.
  3. Alice picks `1`. Now `a = [0]` and `c = [3, 1]`.
  4. Bob picks `0`. Now `a = []` and `c = [3, 1, 0]`.

The final array `c` is `[3, 1, 0]`, and its MEX is `2`. However, the optimal strategy for Bob would be to pick `1` instead of `2` in his first turn, which would result in `c = [3, 0]` and MEX of `1`.

Thus, the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not produce the correct output for all cases.
