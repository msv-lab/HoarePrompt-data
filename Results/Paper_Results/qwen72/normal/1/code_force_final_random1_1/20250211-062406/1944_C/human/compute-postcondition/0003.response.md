To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `start` is 0.
   - `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers where \(0 \leq \text{arr}[i] < \text{len}(\text{arr})\).
   - The length of `arr` (n) satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `vis` is an empty set.

3. **Condition for First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a non-zero value.
   - Since `start` is 0, `nums.get(0, 0)` must return a non-zero value.
   - This means that the integer 0 must be present in `arr` with a frequency greater than 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the presence of the integer 0 in `arr` with a non-zero frequency.
   - Since `nums` is a Counter object derived from `arr`, ensuring that 0 is in `arr` will automatically make `nums.get(0, 0)` return a non-zero value.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to ensure that the integer 0 is present in `arr` with a non-zero frequency. Therefore, the state of `arr` must be adjusted to include at least one occurrence of the integer 0.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
