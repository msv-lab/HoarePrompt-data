The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in `arr` satisfies 0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function does not return any value. However, the state of the program after execution includes modifications to a `Counter` object named `nums` where the frequency of the integer 0 is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 is decreased by 2, and the frequency of the integer 2 is decreased by 2 (but still greater than 0). Additionally, a variable `start` is set to 2, and a set `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and modifies a `Counter` object `nums` by decreasing the frequency of 0 by 1, the frequency of 1 by 2, and the frequency of 2 by 2 (ensuring the frequency of 2 remains greater than 0). It also sets `start` to 2 and `vis` to a set containing 0, 1, and 2. The function does not return any value.**
