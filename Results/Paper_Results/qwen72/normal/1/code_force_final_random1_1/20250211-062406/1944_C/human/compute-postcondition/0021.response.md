Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 1, `start` is 2, and `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` must be greater than 0.**
