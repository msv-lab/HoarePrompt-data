The code snippet `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the frequency of the integer at the index `start` in the `nums` Counter object by 1. Given that `start` is 2, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is decreased by 1. 

Let's break down the impact:

- The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` was originally decreased by 1 (as per the initial state). Now, it is further decreased by 1.
- All other variables (`arr`, `nums` for other integers, `start`, and `vis`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2, `start` is 2, and `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` must be greater than 0.**
