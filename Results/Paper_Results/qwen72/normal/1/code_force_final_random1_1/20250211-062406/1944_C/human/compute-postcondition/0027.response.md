Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 0 â‰¤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, the frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is decreased by 2, and the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is decreased by 2 (but still greater than 0). If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, then `start` is 3, `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2, and the frequency of the integer 3 in `nums` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `start` remains 2, and `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2.***
