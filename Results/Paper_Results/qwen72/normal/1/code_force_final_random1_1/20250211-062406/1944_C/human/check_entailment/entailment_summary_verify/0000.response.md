### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic between Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues and verify the function `func_1` against the problem requirements:

1. **Game Logic and Optimal Strategies:**
   - **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The game involves alternating turns where Alice and Bob pick elements from `a` and append them to `c` (Alice) or just remove them (Bob).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the list, decrementing the frequency of certain integers based on the current value of `start` and its successor.
   - The function updates a set `vis` to keep track of the indices that have been processed.
   - The function prints the value of `start` when it can no longer find a valid successor in `nums` with a non-zero frequency.

3. **Issues with the Function:**
   - **Turn Simulation:** The function does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply processes the array in a linear manner without considering the alternating nature of the game.
   - **Optimal Strategy:** The function does not consider the optimal strategies for both players. It does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob will make decisions based on their respective goals.

4. **Counterexample Verification:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     4
     0 1 2 3
     ```
   - **Expected Output:**
     ```
     1
     ```
   - **Actual Output:**
     The provided code will output `2`, which is incorrect.

   **Explanation of the Counterexample:**
   - In the optimal game, Alice and Bob would play as follows:
     1. Alice picks `3` (since she wants to maximize the score). Now `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [3]`.
     2. Bob picks `1` (since he wants to minimize the score). Now `a = [0, 2]` and `c = [3]`.
     3. Alice picks `2`. Now `a = [0]` and `c = [3, 2]`.
     4. Bob picks `0`. Now `a = []` and `c = [3, 2, 0]`.

   The final array `c` is `[3, 2, 0]`, and its MEX is `1`. This is the correct optimal outcome.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic and optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
