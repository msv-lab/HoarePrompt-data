Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 â‰¤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, the frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2, `start` is 3, `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2, the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` must be greater than 0, and the frequency of the integer 3 in `nums` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
