Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and the frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1. `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is a set containing the element 0. Additionally, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is greater than 0.**
