The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`, and the range parameters (0, 2 * n, 2). To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is within the range defined by the loop.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input
- `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute again:
- The loop increments `i` by 2 each time.
- The loop condition is `i < 2 * n`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 2, so `i` is 2.
- For the loop to continue executing, `2 * n` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 2**
