Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the new `l` (i.e., the sum of elements at even indices), `i` is 2 * n - 2, and the loop is about to start a new set of iterations based on the new input.**
