### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - The key insight is that to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the score.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (index 0). This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at even indices when considering pairs.
   - The sum of these elements (which are the minimums of the pairs) is added to the score.
   - Finally, the score is printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is necessary for maximizing the score.
   - **Pair Selection**: By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element, the program correctly selects the minimum of each pair.
   - **Score Calculation**: The score is calculated by summing the selected elements, which are the minimums of the pairs.
   - **Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop to process each test case independently.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible input (n=1) correctly.
   - It also handles larger inputs (up to the constraints) correctly by sorting and selecting the appropriate elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It sorts the list, selects the minimums of the pairs, and calculates the score accurately.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
