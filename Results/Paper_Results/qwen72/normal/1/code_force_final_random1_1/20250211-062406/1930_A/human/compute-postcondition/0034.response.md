Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4, and `2 * n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[4]` (the fifth element in the list `l`) to the current value of `score`. Initially, `score` was the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. After executing the code, `score` now includes the fifth element as well. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
