Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of elements at even indices), `i` is 2 * n - 2, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`score`**: After all iterations, `score` will be the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l`. This means it will include the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `2 * n`.
- **`i`**: The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 2`.
- **Loop Completion**: The loop runs `n` times, as the range is from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2. Therefore, the loop completes when `i` reaches `2 * n - 2`.
