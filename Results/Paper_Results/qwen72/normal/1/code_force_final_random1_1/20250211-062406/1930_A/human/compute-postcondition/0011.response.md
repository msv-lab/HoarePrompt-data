Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of elements at even indices).
- `i` is 2 * n - 2.
- The loop has completed all its iterations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `l` and `score`:**
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `score` is calculated as the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l`. This means `score` is the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

2. **Understanding `i` and the loop:**
   - `i` is set to 2 * n - 2. This value is used in the context of the loop, but since the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` is no longer relevant to the current state.

3. **Final Value of `score`:**
   - Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `score` has been fully computed as the sum of elements at even indices in the list `l`.

### Output:
The `print(score)` statement will print the value of `score`, which is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the list l)**
