Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` contains the remaining health of each monster, with some elements possibly being 0 if those monsters have been defeated. `rest` is now equal to `k`. `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. If the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is equal to `distance`, the program returns False.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` contains the remaining health of each monster, with the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` reduced by `delta`. `rest` is now equal to `k - delta`. `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, then `pos` is incremented by 1 (indicating one more monster has been defeated), and the element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is set to 0. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0 or not.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0. `rest` is updated to `k - 2*delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and the element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, the element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. In both cases, `distance` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on the condition. `rest` is now `k - 3*delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, the element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `distance` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`, and `distance` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `rest` must be non-zero (i.e., `k` must be greater than `3*delta`), and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
