The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `x`.

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` remain as integers provided by user input.
- `a` remains a list of integers provided by user input.
- A new list `x` is created, which contains integers converted from the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `x` is a list of integers converted from user input.**
