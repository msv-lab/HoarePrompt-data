To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new user input.
- `x` is a list of integers converted from the latest user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **User Input**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `x` is another list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is called with the lists `a` and `x`, and the integer `k` as arguments.
   - The result of this function call will determine what is printed.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, the string `'YES'` will be printed.
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`, the string `'NO'` will be printed.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, the output will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where the output depends on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`)**
