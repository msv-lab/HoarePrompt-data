Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` and `k` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, `x` is a list of integers converted from the latest user input, `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `x` is a list of integers derived from the latest user input.
