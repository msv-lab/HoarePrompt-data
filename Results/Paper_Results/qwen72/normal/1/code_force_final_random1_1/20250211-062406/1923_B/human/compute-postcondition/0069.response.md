Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `pos` remains the same, `a` remains the same except the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` is reduced by `delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` reduces the value at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in the list `a` by `delta`.
- The value of `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- The value of `rest` is `k - 2*delta`.
- The value of `pos` remains the same.
- The value of `distance` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.
