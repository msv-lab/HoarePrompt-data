To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1.
- `n` and `k` are specific integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `x` is a list of integers converted from the latest user input.
- `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The `print` statement calls the function `func_1(a, x, k)`.
2. **Conditional Print**: The result of `func_1(a, x, k)` determines what is printed:
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, 'YES' is printed.
   - If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`, 'NO' is printed.

### Variables and Objects:
- `a`: A list of integers provided by the user.
- `x`: A list of integers converted from the latest user input.
- `k`: A specific integer provided by the user.
- `n`: A specific integer provided by the user (though it is not used in the `print` statement).

### Determining the Output:
- The output depends entirely on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.
- Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_1(a, x, k)` without additional information about the function's logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of information about the function `func_1`, we can only describe the output in terms of the possible outcomes of the function call.

Output: **'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns True, otherwise 'NO'**.
