Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `pos` remains the same, `a` remains the same except the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` is reduced by `delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rest` is updated by subtracting `delta` from its current value (`rest -= delta`). Since `rest` was initially `k - delta`, after the subtraction, `rest` becomes `k - 2*delta`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
