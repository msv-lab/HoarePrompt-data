Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `a` remains the same except the element at index `sorted_indices[pos-1]` is reduced by `delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `pos` is incremented by 1.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain valid, including the values of `delta`, `rest`, the modification to the array `a`, and the increment of `distance`.
- The specific value of `delta` and the exact changes to `a` and `rest` depend on the previous state, which is not altered by the given code snippet.
