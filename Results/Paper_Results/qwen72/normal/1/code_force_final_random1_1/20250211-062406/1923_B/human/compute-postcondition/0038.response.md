Postcondition: **`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` remains `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated (which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0), `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modification to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Additionally, the current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.**
