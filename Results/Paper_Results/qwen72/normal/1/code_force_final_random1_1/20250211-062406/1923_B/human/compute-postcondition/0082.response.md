The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and each element in `x` is unique and sorted in ascending order.

The function returns:
- **Case_1**: False
- **Case_2**: False
- **Case_3**: False
- **Case_4**: True

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster), `x` (a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters), and `k` (a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second). The function returns `True` in a specific case (Case_4) and `False` in other cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3).**
