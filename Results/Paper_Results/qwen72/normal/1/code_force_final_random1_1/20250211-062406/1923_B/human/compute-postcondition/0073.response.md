Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. `rest` is updated to `k - 2*delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and the element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, the element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. `distance` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `rest` must be non-zero (i.e., `k` must be greater than `2*delta`), and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is set to the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- `rest` is updated to `k - 2*delta`.
- If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0:
  - `pos` is incremented by 1.
  - The element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`.
- Otherwise:
  - The element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`.
- `distance` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.
- `rest` must be non-zero (i.e., `k` must be greater than `2*delta`).
- `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.
