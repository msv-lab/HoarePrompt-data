Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `rest` is reduced by `delta`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, and `distance` is 0.***
