Postcondition: ***`a` contains the remaining health of each monster, with some elements possibly being 0 if those monsters have been defeated. `rest` is equal to the number of bullets available, which is now equal to `k` (or less if all bullets have been used). `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. If the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is equal to `distance`, the program returns False.***
