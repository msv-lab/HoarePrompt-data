Output State: **The loop continues to execute until either `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`. At the end of the loop, `rest` will be 0 if there is enough health reduction to exhaust the remaining `rest` value. Otherwise, `pos` will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, indicating that all monsters have been defeated. The elements in `a` corresponding to the indices in `sorted_indices` up to `pos` will be reduced by their respective `delta` values, and any monster whose health reaches 0 will have its corresponding element in `a` set to 0. The value of `distance` will be incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described.**
