To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `x` is a list of integers converted from user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **User Input**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `x` is a list of integers converted from user input.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is called with the lists `a` and `x`, and the integer `k` as arguments.
   - The result of `func_1(a, x, k)` is a boolean value (either `True` or `False`).

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print 'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`.
   - The `print` statement will print 'NO' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact boolean value it will return. However, based on the structure of the `print` statement, we can describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, otherwise 'NO'**. 

This means the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the result of the function `func_1(a, x, k)`.
