The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `rows_number`, which is a positive integer, and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` repeated `rows_number` times. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list has been created, containing the output of `func_3()` for each iteration up to `rows_number`.
