The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and during each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the console. After the function completes, the console will contain the output of `func_14()` for each iteration, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the console output.
