To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
```

Here, the loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable or function call in the loop head is `func_10()`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the State**: Since the state before the loop starts is that none of the variables in the function signature are used, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
