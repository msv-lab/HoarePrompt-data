Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to the initial `l`, `k` is currently equal to the value returned by `func_7()` for `k`, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, `i` is `l`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = l - 1`, appending `2 ** i` to the list `ans` on each iteration.
- After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the values `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `l` after the loop finishes.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop.
