Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 2, `k` is currently equal to the value returned by `func_7()` for `k`, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`.
- Given that `i` is 2, `2 ** i` evaluates to `4`.
- Therefore, `ans` changes from `[2, 3]` to `[2, 3, 4]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
