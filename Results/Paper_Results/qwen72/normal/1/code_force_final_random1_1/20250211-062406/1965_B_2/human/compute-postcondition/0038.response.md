The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided output cases, it implicitly uses two integer values, `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. 

**Case_1:** The function returns the string `'1\n2'`.

**Case_2:** The function returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`. If `k != 1`, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`. Here, `l` is the length of the binary string of `n`, and `lk` is the length of the binary string of `k`.

Functionality: **The function `func_14` returns a specific string based on the values of `n` and `k`. If the conditions for Case_1 are met, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing a sequence of numbers derived from powers of 2 and the value of `k`, and returns a space-separated string of these elements.**
