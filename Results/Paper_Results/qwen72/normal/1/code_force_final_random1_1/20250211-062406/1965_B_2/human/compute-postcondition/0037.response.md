Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`. If `k != 1`, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`. Here, `l` is the length of the binary string of `n`, and `lk` is the length of the binary string of `k`.**
