The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `2 ** i` is `4`. Therefore, the list `ans` is updated to include this new value.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing `[1, 2, 4]`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is 2, `lk` must be greater than 2.**
