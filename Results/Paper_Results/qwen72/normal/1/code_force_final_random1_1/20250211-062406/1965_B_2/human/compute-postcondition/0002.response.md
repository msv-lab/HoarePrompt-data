To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop statement is: `for _ in range(func_10()):`
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and the value of `func_14()` has been printed to the console.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0. This is because the `range` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) the value returned by `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop has already executed once, the value of `func_10()` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. However, the exact value of `func_10()` is not specified, only that it must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `func_14()` being printed to the console does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `func_10()` still returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. The value of `func_14()` being printed to the console remains unchanged.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and the value of `func_14()` has been printed to the console.**
