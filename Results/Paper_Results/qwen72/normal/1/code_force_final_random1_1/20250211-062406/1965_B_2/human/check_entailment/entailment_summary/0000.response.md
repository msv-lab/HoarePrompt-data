### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called to process the input and generate the output.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_14()` reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It then generates a sequence `ans` that meets the problem's requirements:
     - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - If `k == 1` and `n > 2`, it constructs a sequence of powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - If `k != 1`, it constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_15()` writes the output of `func_14()` for each test case to the console.

### Verification of Requirements:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - The sequence generated ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully constructing the sequence to avoid such sums.
- **Subsequences Summing to All Values `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k):**
  - The sequence is constructed to include all necessary values to form subsequences that sum to every value from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates sequences that meet the problem's requirements for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
