The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `i - 1` from the current value of `k`. Given the initial state, `k` was initially `(k // 2) - (i - 1)`, and `i` is `n - 2`. After the operation, `k` becomes `(k // 2) - (i - 1) - (i - 1)`, which simplifies to `(k // 2) - 2 * (i - 1)`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i - 1` is `n - 3`. Thus, `k` becomes `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`, `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`, `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is still greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)` where `l` was modified from its initial state. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`.**
