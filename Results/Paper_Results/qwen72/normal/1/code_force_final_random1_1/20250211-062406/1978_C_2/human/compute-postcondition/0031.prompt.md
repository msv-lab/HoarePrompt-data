You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` remains a positive integer, `k` is reduced by a series of subtractions based on the loop's decrement pattern, `l` is the result of multiple calls to `func_3` with increasing `c` values, `c` equals the number of iterations completed, and `i` is the final value of the loop counter which is `-1` or the last even number before `-1` depending on the initial value of `n`. The loop terminates when `k` is no longer greater than or equal to `i - 1`, or when `i` becomes `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It returns a list or the result of calling other functions (`func_2` or `func_3`) based on the value of `k` and the internal logic of the function.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the list `l` which contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is a positive integer.

Case_2: The program returns the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `c` set to 1, `k` set to `k // 2` (which is a non-negative integer less than `i - 1`), and `l` set to a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Case_3: The program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)` where `l` was modified from its initial state.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`, where `k` is `(k // 2) - (i - 1)` and `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)` where `l` was modified from its initial state.

Case_5: The program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`. The value of `l` is the result of calling `func_3(2, l)`, but without knowing the implementation of `func_3`, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.

Case_6: The program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is 3, `k` is `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
