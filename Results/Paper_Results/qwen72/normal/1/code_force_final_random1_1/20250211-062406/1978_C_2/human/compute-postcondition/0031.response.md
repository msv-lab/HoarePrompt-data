Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer). It modifies a list `l` initially containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Depending on the value of `k` and the internal logic, the function may return the list `l` directly, or it may return the result of calling either `func_2` or `func_3` with specific arguments. Specifically, if `k` is reduced to zero during the loop, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, the function continues modifying `l` through calls to `func_3` and adjusting `k` until the loop terminates. The final state of the program includes a modified list `l` and a potentially reduced value of `k`. **
