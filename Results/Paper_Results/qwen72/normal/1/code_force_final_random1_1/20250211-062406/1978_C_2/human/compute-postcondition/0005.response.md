Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, with new values assigned by `func_4()`. `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`.** 

Explanation: The value of `l` is now the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)`. The values of `n` and `k` remain as integers within their specified ranges, and `n` is not equal to 0. The exact value of `l` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided here.
