Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 5 * 10^11 (after floor division by 2), `l` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if k == 0:
        return l
    if 1 + i > k:
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(-k, x)
        return l
    k = k - i + 1
    x = l[-1]
    l.pop(-1)
    l.insert(0, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - n + 2`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is the list with `x` inserted at the beginning and the last element removed, and `x` is no longer the last element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` now has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last two elements removed, and `x` is no longer the last element of `l`. If `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is. `x` is no longer the last element of the original list `l` before the modifications.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 3) + 1`, the list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning, and the last two elements removed. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element. If `1 + i` is greater than `k` and `k` is not 0, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`, and the last three elements are removed. The list `l` does not contain `x` at any other position. `x` is no longer the last element of the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
