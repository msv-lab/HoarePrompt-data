Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing specific elements of `a` based on the conditions involving `s[0]` and `s[i]` with `a[r]` appended to it, `l` is an integer that depends on the values of `s[0]` and `s[i]`, `r` is an integer that depends on the values of `s[0]` and `s[i]`, `i` is 2.**
