You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise it is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise it is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, and `i` is `n - 1`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise it is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise it is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, modulo `m`, and `p` is the final cumulative product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans`, which contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` is reversed, meaning the first element of the returned list corresponds to the last element of the original `ans` list, and so on.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a reversed list `ans` of `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a reversed list `ans`, which contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` is reversed, meaning the first element of the returned list corresponds to the last element of the original `ans` list, and so on.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
