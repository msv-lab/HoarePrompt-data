The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function returns a list `ans` of `n` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (which is derived from `a` and `s`) from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` is reversed, meaning the first element of the returned list corresponds to the last element of the original `ans` list, and so on.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a reversed list `ans` of `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`.**
