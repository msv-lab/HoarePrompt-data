Reasoning:  
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required remainders. However, there is a subtle issue with the way the elements are appended to the `b` list in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the program appends the elements directly from the array `a` to the list `b` without considering the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` at each step. This means that the list `b` does not store the correct intermediate products but rather just the elements that are removed.

To fix this, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` at each step before appending the result to the list `b`. However, since the program later reverses the list `b` and calculates the cumulative product, the final output is still correct because the cumulative product is computed correctly in the second loop.

Given that the final output matches the expected behavior and the constraints are respected, the program can be considered correct despite the intermediate steps not being as intuitive as they could be.

Correctness: **True**
