Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise it is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise it is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: This list remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- **`s`**: This string remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- **`b`**: After the loop completes, `b` will contain all elements of `a` but in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the leftmost element of `a` (starting from index `l`) is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the rightmost element of `a` (starting from index `r`) is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented.
- **`l`**: After the loop completes, `l` will be equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`. If all characters in `s` are 'L', `l` will be `n`.
- **`r`**: After the loop completes, `r` will be `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`. If all characters in `s` are 'R', `r` will be -1.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`, which is the last index of the loop.
