### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The program initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the command string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. If the command is 'L', it appends the element at index `l` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the element at index `r` and decrements `r`.

4. **Product Calculation**:
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes a variable `p` to 1.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying each element by `p` and taking the result modulo `m`. This ensures that the product is always within the bounds of `m`.
   - The results are stored in the list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified, processes the commands in the correct order, and calculates the required remainders accurately.

**Correctness: True**
