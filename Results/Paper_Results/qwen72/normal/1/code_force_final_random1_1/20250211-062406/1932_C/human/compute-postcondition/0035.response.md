Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise it is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise it is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being the initial value of `p` and the second being the new value of `p` calculated as `p * (p * b[n-2] % m) % m`, `p` is now `p * (p * b[n-2] % m) % m * b[n-3] % m`, `v` is `b[n-3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * v % m`, where `v` is `b[n-3]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `p` is `p * (p * b[n-2] % m) % m * b[n-3] % m`.
