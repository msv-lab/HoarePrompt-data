Postcondition: ***`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. If `x` (which is `r - 2`) is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2] - (idx_B[r - 2] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains as `B[r - 1]`.***
