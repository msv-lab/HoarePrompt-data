The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Since `r` was initially the length of `B`, it is now one less than the length of `B`. The values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if-else part.**
