Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[-1] - A[-length of B] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.***
