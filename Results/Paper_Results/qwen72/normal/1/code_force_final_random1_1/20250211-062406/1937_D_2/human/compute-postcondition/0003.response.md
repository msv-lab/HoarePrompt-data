To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as this would mean there are iterations to perform. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(0, n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `A` is an empty list.
- `idx_A` is an empty list.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list**
