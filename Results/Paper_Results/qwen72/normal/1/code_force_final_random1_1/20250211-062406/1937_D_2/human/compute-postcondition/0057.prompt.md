Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the string `s`). The list `idx_A` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '>' in the string `s`. The list `A` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '>' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty lists. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`. If `idx_B` was initially empty, `B` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, if `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i, i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. Additionally, if `len(idx_B) != 0`, `x` is 0. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` remains a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
