Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `b` after the update depends on the current values of `b`, `idx_B[r]`, `i`, and `l`.
