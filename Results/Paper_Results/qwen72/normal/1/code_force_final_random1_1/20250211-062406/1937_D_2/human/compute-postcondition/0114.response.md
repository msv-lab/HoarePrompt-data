To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` will be equal to `n`.
- `i` will be 0.
- `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'.
- `a` is now equal to the last element of `B`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` using the original value of `b` which is the element at index `l - 1` in list `A`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `a`:**
   - `a` is the last element of `B`.
   - Since `B` contains values based on the positions of '<' in `s`, `a` will be one of these values. Without the exact string `s`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `a`, but we know it is the last element of `B`.

2. **Determine the value of `b`:**
   - `b` is updated based on the condition `l - r - 1 > 0`.
   - If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` using the original value of `b` which is the element at index `l - 1` in list `A`.
   - Since `i` is 0 and `l` and `r` are determined by the lengths of `idx_B` and `B`, the exact value of `b` depends on these conditions. Without the exact values of `idx_A` and `A`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `b`, but we know it is updated based on the given formula.

3. **Determine the value of `n - i`:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `n - i` is simply `n`.

4. **Calculate the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`:**
   - This expression combines the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are not explicitly known, we can only describe their values based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where:
- `a` is the last element of `B`.
- `b` is updated based on the given conditions.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 0.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + n (where a is the last element of B, b is updated based on the given conditions, and n is a positive integer)**
