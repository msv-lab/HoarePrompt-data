To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `l` and `r`:**
   - Since `i` is 1, we need to check the value of `s[1]` to determine `l`.
   - If `s[1]` is '>', then `l` is 1.
   - If `s[1]` is not '>', then `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `B` if `l` is 1, otherwise `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.

2. **Determine `a`:**
   - `a` is `A[l]`.
   - If `l` is 1, then `a` is `A[1]`.
   - If `l` is 0, then `a` is `A[0]`.

3. **Determine `x`:**
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
   - If `l` is 1, then `x` is `r - 3`.
   - If `l` is 0, then `x` is `r - 2`.

4. **Determine `b`:**
   - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - If `l` is 1, then `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * 2`.
   - If `l` is 0, then `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * 1`.

5. **Calculate the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:**
   - Substitute the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` into the expression.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = "> < < >"`, `A = [10, 20]`, and `B = [3, 5, 7]`.

- `i` is 1.
- `s[1]` is '>', so `l` is 1.
- `r` is the length of `B`, which is 3.
- `a` is `A[1]`, which is 20.
- `x` is `3 - 3`, which is 0.
- `b` is `(idx_B[2 - 1] - 1) * 2`, which is `(idx_B[1] - 1) * 2`.
  - `idx_B` contains the indices of '<' in descending order: `[3, 2, 1]`.
  - `idx_B[1]` is 2.
  - `b` is `(2 - 1) * 2`, which is 2.
- The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` becomes `20 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 1 + 1`, which is `40 + 4 + 1 + 1`, which is 46.

### Final Output:
Output: **46**
