Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0], and `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains `[0]` depending on whether the first character of `s` is '>' or not. If `len(idx_A) != 0`, then if `s[0]` is '>', `idx_A` is `[0]`, `A` is `[x, x + 1]`, and `x` is `x + 1`. If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists, and the code snippet will raise an error.***
