Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the string `s`). The list `idx_A` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '>' in the string `s`. The list `A` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '>' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty lists. `B` is an empty list.**
