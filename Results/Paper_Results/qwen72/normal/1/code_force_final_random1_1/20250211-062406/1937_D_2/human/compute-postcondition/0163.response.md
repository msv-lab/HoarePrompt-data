Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `b` is `B[r - 1]`, `x` is `r - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = B[r - 1]` assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`.
- All other variables (`a`, `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `b` is now specifically `B[r - 1]`, which means `b` holds the second-to-last element of the list `B`.
