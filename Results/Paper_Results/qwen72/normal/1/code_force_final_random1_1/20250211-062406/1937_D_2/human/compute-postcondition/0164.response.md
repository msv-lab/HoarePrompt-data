Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2]`, `x` is `r - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b - B[x]`.
- Since `b` was initially `B[r - 1]` and `x` is `r - 2`, the new value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - 2]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
