Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', `idx_A` is now a list containing `[0]`. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `idx_A`. Therefore, `idx_A` now contains the element `[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
