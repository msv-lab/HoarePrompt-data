Output State: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'. `a` is now equal to the first element of `A` (i.e., `A[0]`). `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0. `b` is now equal to the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its current value.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, `a`, `x`) retain their previous values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
