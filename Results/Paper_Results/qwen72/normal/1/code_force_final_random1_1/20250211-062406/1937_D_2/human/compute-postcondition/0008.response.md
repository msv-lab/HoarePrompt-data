Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is not empty, `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- Since `A` is an empty list, `A[len(A) - 1]` would raise an error, but since the initial state specifies that `A` is an empty list, this part of the calculation is undefined.
- However, the rest of the calculation is valid: `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1] * len(idx_A)`.
- Therefore, `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
