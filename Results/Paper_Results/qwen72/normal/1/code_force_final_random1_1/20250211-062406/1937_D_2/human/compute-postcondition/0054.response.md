Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0, 0]`. Additionally, if `len(idx_B) != 0`, `x` is 0.***
