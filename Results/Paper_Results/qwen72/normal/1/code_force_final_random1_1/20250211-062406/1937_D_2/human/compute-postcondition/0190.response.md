Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2. If `l` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.***
