Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
