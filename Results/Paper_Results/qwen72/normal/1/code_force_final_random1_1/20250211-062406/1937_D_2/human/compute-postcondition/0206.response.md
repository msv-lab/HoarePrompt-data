Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and prints the minimum number of swaps required to make the string balanced, where all '<' characters appear before any '>' characters. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly to the console. The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the function. **
