Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n` (though the value of `n` is not explicitly given, it doesn't affect the print statement).
- `i` is 2.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order (the exact values are not needed for this print statement).
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop (the exact values are not needed for this print statement).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 2.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged (their values are not relevant to this print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is given as 2.
- The expression `i + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is 3.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `i + 1` followed by a space.
Output: **3 **
