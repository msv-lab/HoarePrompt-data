Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships between these variables, as described in the initial state, continue to hold true.
