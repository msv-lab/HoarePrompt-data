The code `B.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `B`. Given that `x` is `0` and `B` initially contains `[0]`, after appending `x`, `B` will contain `[0, 0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` is `[n - 2]`, `B` is `[0, 0]`, `x` is `0`**
