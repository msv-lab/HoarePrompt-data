Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. `x` is `0 + (i - i) * 1 = 0`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and `x` is `0 + (0 - i) * 0 = 0`.**

Explanation:
- `B[len(B) - 1]` is `0` because `B` is `[0, 0]`.
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is `i` if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`.
- `len(idx_B)` is `1` if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`.
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `x` is calculated as `0 + (i - i) * 1 = 0`.
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and `x` is calculated as `0 + (0 - i) * 0 = 0`.
