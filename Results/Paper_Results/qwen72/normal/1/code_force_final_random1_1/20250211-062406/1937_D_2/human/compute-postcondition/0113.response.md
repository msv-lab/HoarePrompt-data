Output State: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `a` is now equal to the last element of `B`. `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` using the original value of `b` which is the element at index `l - 1` in list `A`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.
- The value of `i` is 0, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the last element in `idx_A` (if `l` is 0, this would be an invalid index, but assuming `l` is at least 1).
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, so `r + 1` is the length of `B`.
- The value of `b` is updated accordingly, and all other variables remain unchanged.
