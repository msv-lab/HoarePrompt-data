The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `j` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.**
