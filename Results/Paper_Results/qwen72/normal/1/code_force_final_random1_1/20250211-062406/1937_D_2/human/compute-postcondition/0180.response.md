Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was the length of `B` minus 1. After decrementing, `r` is now the length of `B` minus 2. All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
