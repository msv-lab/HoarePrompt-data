Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated using the expression `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is calculated based on the given formula, which subtracts the product of `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2])` and `(l - r - 1)` from the original value of `b`.
