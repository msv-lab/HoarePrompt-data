Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from the second line of the input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\).
- `s` is the next line in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 * n - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet `print(2 * n - 1)` will print the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`.
- The value of `n` is derived from the second line of the input, and it is given that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\).

### Calculation:
- The expression `2 * n - 1` will compute the value of twice `n` minus one.
- Since `n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\), the result of `2 * n - 1` will be an integer within the range \(3 \leq 2 * n - 1 \leq 2 * 10^8 - 1\).

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is an integer derived from the second line of the input and is within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\).

Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is an integer derived from the second line of the input and is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8)**
