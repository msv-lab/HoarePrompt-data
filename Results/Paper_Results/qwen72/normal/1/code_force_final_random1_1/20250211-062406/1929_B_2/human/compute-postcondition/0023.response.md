Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from the second line of the input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\).
- `s` is the next line in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `k`**: According to the initial state, `k` is an integer derived from the second line of the input, and it satisfies the condition \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\).
2. **Math Operation**: The code snippet calculates `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which means it takes the value of `k`, divides it by 2, and then rounds up to the nearest integer.

### Calculation:
- If `k` is an odd number, `k / 2` will be a non-integer, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.
- If `k` is an even number, `k / 2` will be an integer, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will remain the same.

### Example Values:
- If `k = 1`, then `math.ceil(1 / 2) = math.ceil(0.5) = 1`.
- If `k = 2`, then `math.ceil(2 / 2) = math.ceil(1) = 1`.
- If `k = 3`, then `math.ceil(3 / 2) = math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.
- If `k = 4`, then `math.ceil(4 / 2) = math.ceil(2) = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the ceiling of `k / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2)**
