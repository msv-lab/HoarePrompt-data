Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are the integers provided by the user input.

Given the initial state, we know that `t` is greater than 1, but this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement. The `print` statement only involves the variable `k`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `k`**: This is an integer provided by the user input.
2. **Expression `k // 2`**: This performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and truncates the result to the nearest whole number towards zero.
3. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`**: After performing the integer division, 1 is added to the result.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer provided by the user input)**
