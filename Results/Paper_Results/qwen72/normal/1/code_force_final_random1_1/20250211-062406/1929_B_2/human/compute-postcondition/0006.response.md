To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
- \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `k`**: 
   - `k` is an integer provided by user input.
   - There are no specific constraints on the value of `k` other than it cannot be equal to \(4 \times n - 2\).

2. **Expression `k / 2`**:
   - This expression divides `k` by 2. Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` could result in a floating-point number.

3. **Function `ceil`**:
   - The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds up the result of `k / 2` to the nearest integer.

### Output Calculation:
- The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will be a floating-point number, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round this number up to the nearest integer.

### Final Output:
- The exact value of `k` is not specified, but we know it is an integer and not equal to \(4 \times n - 2\).
- Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
