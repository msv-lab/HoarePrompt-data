Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The solution provided does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling the Maximum Diagonals Case**: When `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`, the solution prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is incorrect because the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by a single cell is 2 (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, the correct answer should be `n` when `k` is `4 * n - 2`.

2. **General Case Handling**: For other values of `k`, the solution uses `ceil(k / 2)`. This is not always correct. The correct approach should consider the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least `k` diagonals. The correct formula for this is more complex and involves ensuring that the cells are placed optimally to cover the required diagonals.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # If k > 2 * n - 1, we need to cover both main and anti-diagonals
            # The optimal way is to place cells along the main diagonal and then
            # extend to the anti-diagonals.
            print(n + (k - 2 * n + 1) // 2)
```

This corrected version handles the cases where `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n - 1` and where `k` is greater than `2 * n - 1` correctly. The logic ensures that the minimum number of cells is used to cover the required number of diagonals.
