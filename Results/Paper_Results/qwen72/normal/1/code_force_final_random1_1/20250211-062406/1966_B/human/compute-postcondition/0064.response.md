Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 1, `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `impossible` while keeping the rest of the variables in their original state.
