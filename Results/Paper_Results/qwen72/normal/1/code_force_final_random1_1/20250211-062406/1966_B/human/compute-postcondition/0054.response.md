Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing three input strings, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends a new input string to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains two input strings, so after appending one more input string, `gr` now contains three input strings. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
