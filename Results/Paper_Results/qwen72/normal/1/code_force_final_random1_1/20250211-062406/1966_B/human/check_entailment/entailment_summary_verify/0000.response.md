### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight is that if any two squares of the same color can be selected, the entire subrectangle between them can be colored to that color. Therefore, the grid can be made uniform if there is at least one pair of the same color in the grid.

#### Program Analysis:
The program `func` performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.
3. Initializes the answer as 'YES'.
4. Checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color.
5. If they do not have the same color, it further checks if the rows and columns along the edges of the grid are uniform in color.
6. If any of these conditions are not met, it sets the answer to 'NO'.
7. Prints the answer for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior. It checks the corners and edges of the grid to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it mentions the test case:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
For this test case, the program will output "NO" because the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, and the edges are not uniform. However, this is a valid output because it is indeed impossible to make all squares the same color in this case.

Another test case mentioned is:
```
2 2
WW
WW
```
The program correctly outputs "YES" for this case because all squares are already the same color.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The original assessment suggests that the program's logic is insufficient because it only checks the corners and edges. However, the problem's constraints and the nature of the operations imply that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and the edges are not uniform, it is impossible to make all squares the same color. This is because any operation that changes the color of a subrectangle must start with two squares of the same color.

#### Conclusion:
The program's logic is actually correct for the given problem. It correctly identifies cases where it is impossible to make all squares the same color by checking the corners and edges. The original assessment's counterexamples do not invalidate the program's logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The given program is correct)
