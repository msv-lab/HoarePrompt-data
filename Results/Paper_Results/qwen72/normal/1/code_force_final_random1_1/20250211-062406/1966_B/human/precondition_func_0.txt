The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a grid of colors, but the function definition provided is incomplete. Typically, the function should take parameters such as the dimensions of the grid (n, m) and the grid itself, represented as a list of strings or a 2D list of characters ('W' for white and 'B' for black). Additionally, the function might need to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t.
