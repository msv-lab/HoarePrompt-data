To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1)
- `m` is the new input integer
- `gr` is an empty list
- `i` is `n-1`
- Conditions related to `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should start at 0, and `n` should be greater than 0 (which it already is, as it's specified to be greater than 1).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`**
