The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
