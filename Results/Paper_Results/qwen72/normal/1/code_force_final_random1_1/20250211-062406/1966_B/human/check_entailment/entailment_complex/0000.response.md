### Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color through a series of operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing it in a list `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function starts by assuming the answer is 'YES' (`ans = 'YES'`).

3. **Edge Condition Check:**
   - The function checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors.
   - If they are different, it sets a flag `impossible` to `True` and checks the following conditions:
     - It iterates through the first row and the last row to see if there are any adjacent cells with different colors.
     - If any such pair is found, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
     - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the rows, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - It then repeats a similar check for the first column and the last column.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Top-Left and Bottom-Right Corners:**
  - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations. This is because any operation that changes the color of a subrectangle must start with two cells of the same color.

- **Uniformity Check:**
  - The function checks if the first and last rows and columns are uniform in color. If any of these rows or columns have adjacent cells with different colors, it means the grid cannot be made uniform.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where the grid is already uniform (all cells are the same color).
  - However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the grid is a single cell (1x1 grid), which should always be 'YES'.

- **Logic for Uniformity:**
  - The logic for checking uniformity in the first and last rows and columns is correct. If any of these rows or columns have adjacent cells with different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. It handles the key conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
