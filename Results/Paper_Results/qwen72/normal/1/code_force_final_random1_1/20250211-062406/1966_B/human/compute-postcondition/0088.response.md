Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, or 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.***
