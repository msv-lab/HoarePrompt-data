To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1).
   - `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1).
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-2`.
   - `ans` is initially set to 'YES'.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and if `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, if any of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` were true for any `k` in the range from 0 to `n-2`, then `impossible` is set to `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'.
   - If none of these conditions are met, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` remains 'YES'.

Let's break down the conditions step by step:

1. **First Condition:**
   - Check if `gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1]` and `impossible` is `True`.
   - If this condition is true, set `ans` to 'NO'.

2. **Second Condition:**
   - Iterate over `k` from 0 to `n-2` and check if `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]`.
   - If any of these conditions are true, set `impossible` to `False`.

3. **Final State:**
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, `ans` remains 'YES'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `ans` will be determined based on the following logic:

- If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` and `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` will be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, if any of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` are true for any `k` in the range from 0 to `n-2`, then `impossible` will be `False` and `ans` will remain 'YES'.
- If none of these conditions are met, `impossible` will remain `True` and `ans` will remain 'YES'.

Since the exact values of `gr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact outcome of the conditions. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans` after evaluating the conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described)**
