Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, or 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `gr = []` initializes `gr` as an empty list, overriding its previous value which was a list containing `n` input strings. All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `impossible`) remain unchanged. The conditions involving `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n-1][m-1]` cannot be evaluated since `gr` is now an empty list, but the logic for determining `ans` and `impossible` remains the same as described in the initial state.
