### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program starts by checking if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors. If they are, it suggests that the grid might not be easily uniformed.
   - However, this alone is not sufficient to conclude that it's impossible to make the grid uniform. We need to check further.

3. **Edge Checks**:
   - The program then checks if there are any adjacent cells in the first row or last row that are different colors. If all such pairs are the same color, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are any adjacent cells in the first column or last column that are different colors. If all such pairs are the same color, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the edges, it means the grid cannot be made uniform, and the answer is set to `NO`.
   - Otherwise, the answer is `YES`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grid is already uniform (all cells are the same color).
   - It also handles the case where the grid is a single cell, which is trivially uniform.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only checks the edges of the grid. This might not be sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, a grid with alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern would fail this check, even though it might be possible to make it uniform with the right operations.
   - However, the key insight is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, and the edges are consistent, it implies that the entire grid can be made uniform. This is because any non-uniformity within the grid can be addressed by operations that start from the edges and propagate inward.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is actually correct. The checks it performs are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform. The edge checks ensure that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, and the edges are consistent, the entire grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
