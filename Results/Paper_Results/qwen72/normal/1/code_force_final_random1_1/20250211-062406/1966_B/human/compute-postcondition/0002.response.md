The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`, respectively.

- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `tc` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` and `m` are now assigned the integer values from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers.**
