Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 'NO', overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` while keeping all other variables the same as they were initially.
