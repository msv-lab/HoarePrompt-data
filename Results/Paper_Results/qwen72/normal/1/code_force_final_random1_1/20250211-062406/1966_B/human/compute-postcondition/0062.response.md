Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 0. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is different from the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.***
