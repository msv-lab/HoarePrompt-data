t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, representing the dimensions of the grid. The grid is represented by a list of n strings, each string containing m characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
