Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` remains 'YES'.** 

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is set to `True`. Since the code snippet only sets `impossible` to `True` and does not change any other variables or conditions, all other initial state conditions remain unchanged. The variable `ans` remains 'YES' because the condition to set `ans` to 'NO' has not been evaluated yet.
