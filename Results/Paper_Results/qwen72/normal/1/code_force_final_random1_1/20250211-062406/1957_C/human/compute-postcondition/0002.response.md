To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions required by the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
```

This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3. Additionally, `i` should start at 3.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 and `i` starts at 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
