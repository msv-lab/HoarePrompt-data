The value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be at least 4
- `i` is 4
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7

We substitute the known values into the formula:

- `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = (7 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = (7 + 18) % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = 25 % 1000000007`
- `dp[4] = 25`

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25**
