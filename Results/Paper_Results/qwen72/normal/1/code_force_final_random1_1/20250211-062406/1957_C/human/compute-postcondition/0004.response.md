The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[3]` is 7. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
