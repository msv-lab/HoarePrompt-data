Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The initialization of the DP array `dp` is correct. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are appropriate for the problem, as they represent the number of valid configurations for a 1x1 and 2x2 grid, respectively.

2. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct. This formula accounts for:
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and i-th column, which leaves `dp[i-1]` configurations for the remaining (i-1)x(i-1) grid.
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and any of the (i-1) columns, and then placing a rook in the corresponding column and any of the (i-1) rows, which leaves `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` configurations for the remaining (i-2)x(i-2) grid.

3. **Input Handling**: The main loop correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks due to the initial moves. This ensures that these positions are not considered for further placements. However, there is a potential issue here. The set `invalid` should only include unique rows and columns, but the current implementation might add the same row or column multiple times if the same row or column is part of multiple initial moves. This could lead to incorrect results.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The number of valid configurations for the remaining rows and columns (after accounting for the initial moves) is calculated using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is correct in principle, but the potential issue with the `invalid` set needs to be addressed.

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The `max(1, ...)` ensures that if there are no remaining rows or columns to place rooks, the result is 1 (since an empty board is also a valid configuration).

Given the potential issue with the `invalid` set, the program may produce incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, if the same row or column is part of multiple initial moves, the `invalid` set will count it multiple times, leading to an incorrect calculation of the number of remaining rows and columns.

Final: **False**
