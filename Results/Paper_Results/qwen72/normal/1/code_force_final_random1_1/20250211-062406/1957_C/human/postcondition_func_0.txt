The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5. It computes a sequence `dp` using a specific recurrence relation and returns no explicit value. After the function completes, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and the array `dp` is populated such that `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[n]` contains the final computed value based on the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. The function modifies the `dp` array in place.
