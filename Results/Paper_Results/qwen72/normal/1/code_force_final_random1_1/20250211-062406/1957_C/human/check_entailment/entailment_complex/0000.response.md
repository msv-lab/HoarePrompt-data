### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**:
   - The program sets the recursion limit to 400,000, which is necessary for the dynamic programming (DP) array to handle large values of `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices up to 300,000. This array is used to store the number of valid configurations for a given number of free rows/columns.

3. **Precomputation Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` precomputes the DP values up to `n` using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation correctly calculates the number of ways to place rooks on a board with `i` free rows/columns, considering the constraints of the problem.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns of these moves to the `invalid` set to keep track of the positions that are already occupied.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of free rows/columns by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It then prints the result using the precomputed DP array, ensuring that the result is at least 1 (since there is always at least one valid configuration).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
- The precomputation function `func_1` is correctly defined and computes the DP values using the appropriate recurrence relation.
- The main logic for handling multiple test cases and calculating the final configurations is also correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
