To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input.
   - If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation.
   - Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of `k / 2`.

3. **Analyzing the Condition:**
   - The condition \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) is given, but it does not affect the value of `k` directly. It only tells us whether `k` is derived from `n` using the formula \(4 \times n - 2\).

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Regardless of whether the condition \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) is true or false, the value of `k` is still an integer.
   - The expression `k / 2` will be a floating-point number.
   - The `ceil` function will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the ceiling of k divided by 2)**
