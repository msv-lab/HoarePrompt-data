Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers derived from the lines of the input, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The loop has processed all lines in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`, and for each pair `(n, k)` read from the input, the appropriate output has been printed based on the conditions: if `k` is less than or equal to 4 * n - 4, the value `math.ceil(k / 2)` was printed; if `k` is 4 * n - 3, the value `2 * n - 1` was printed; if `k` is 4 * n - 2, the value `2 * n` was printed.**
