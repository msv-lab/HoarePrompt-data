The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it appears that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.

Given these parameters, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, I'll assume the function returns some computed value or a list of results for each test case.
