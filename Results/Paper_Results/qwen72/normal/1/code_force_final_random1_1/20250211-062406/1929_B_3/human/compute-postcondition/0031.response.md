Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input (excluding the first line), where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each pair `(n, k)`, it prints a specific value based on the following conditions: if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`; if `k` is `4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`; if `k` is `4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`. After processing all input lines, the function completes without returning any value. **
