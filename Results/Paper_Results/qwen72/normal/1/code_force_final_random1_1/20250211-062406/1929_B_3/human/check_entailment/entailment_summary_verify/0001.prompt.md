You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2

    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a square grid of size `n` and a requirement to color at least `k` diagonals. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. A diagonal is defined as a set of cells where either the row index plus the column index is constant (main diagonals) or the row index minus the column index is constant (anti-diagonals).

2. **Total Diagonals**: For an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total. This includes both main and anti-diagonals.

3. **Key Insight**: To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we can use the fact that each colored cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).

4. **Edge Case**: If \( k \) is equal to the total number of diagonals \( 4n - 2 \), we need to color all cells in a way that covers all diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because the last diagonal will require an additional cell to be covered.

5. **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover 2 diagonals, and we need to round up to ensure we cover at least \( k \) diagonals.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). If true, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

7. **Verification**:
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program correctly prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - For other values of \( k \), the program correctly prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all cases correctly.
