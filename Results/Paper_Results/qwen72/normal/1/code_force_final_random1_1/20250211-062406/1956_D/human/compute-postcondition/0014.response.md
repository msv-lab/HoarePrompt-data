The code snippet `pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l` calculates the position of the maximum value (`mx`) in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and then adjusts this position to reflect its index in the original list `a`.

- `a[l:r + 1]` extracts the sublist from `a` starting at index `l` and ending at index `r` (inclusive).
- `.index(mx)` finds the index of the maximum value `mx` within this sublist.
- Adding `l` to this index adjusts it to the correct position in the original list `a`.

Therefore, `pos` is now the index of the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` within the original list `a`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`.**
