The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` of integers and appends tuples to a list `ops` based on certain conditions. It accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `l` and `r` (integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a)), and `ops` (a list that will store tuples of integers representing the operations performed). The function does not return any value. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops`. If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets each element from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function recursively calls itself with updated indices until the base case is met. After the function completes, `a` may have some elements modified to zero or `r - l + 1`, and `ops` will contain tuples representing the operations performed.
