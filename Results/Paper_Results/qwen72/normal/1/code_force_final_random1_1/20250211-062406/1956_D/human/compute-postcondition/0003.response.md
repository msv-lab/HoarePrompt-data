To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - No variables are passed to the function `func_3`.
   - Inside `func_3`, `n` is an integer read from input, representing the length of the array `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input, split by spaces.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.

2. **Execution of `func_3`**:
   - The user is prompted to input an integer `n`, which represents the length of the array `a`.
   - The user is then prompted to input `n` integers separated by spaces, which are stored in the list `a`.
   - The function `func_2(a)` is called with the list `a` as an argument, and it returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.

3. **Understanding `func_2(a)`**:
   - Since the implementation of `func_2(a)` is not provided, we need to infer what `s` and `m` might represent based on common practices.
   - Typically, `s` could represent the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
   - `m` could represent the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `ops` could represent some other value or operation result, but since it is not used in the `print` statement, we focus on `s` and `m`.

4. **Output of `print(s, m)`**:
   - The `print(s, m)` statement will print the values of `s` and `m` as determined by the function `func_2(a)`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the sum of the elements in the list `a` and the maximum value in the list `a`.

Output: **s, m (where s is the sum of the elements in the list a and m is the maximum value in the list a)**
