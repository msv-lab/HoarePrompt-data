To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.
   - `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(l, r)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` and `a` are provided by the user.
   - `func_2(a)` returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples, and since it is non-empty, it contains at least one tuple `(l, r)`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)` will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `(l, r)` is the next tuple in the `ops` list.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, the first tuple in `ops` will be used for `l` and `r`.
   - Let's denote the first tuple in `ops` as `(l, r)`.
   - The print statement will then output `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact values of `l` and `r` depend on the specific tuple in `ops`, but the print statement will add 1 to both `l` and `r`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(l + 1, r + 1) (where (l, r) is the first tuple in the `ops` list)**
