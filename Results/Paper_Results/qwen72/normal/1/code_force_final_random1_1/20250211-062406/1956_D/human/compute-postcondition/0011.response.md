The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. Inside the function, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array `a`. It then reads `n` integers from the input, forming the list `a`, where each element is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function processes this input and returns a result based on the elements of `a`.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where each element is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and returns a result based on the elements of `a`.**
