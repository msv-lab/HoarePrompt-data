You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where each element is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of the elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum value in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function completes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the output is the printed values of `s`, `m`, and the modified tuples in `ops`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`.
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array using no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is designed to handle the base case where `l == r` and also to recursively process the subarray from `l+1` to `r`. If the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray (`r - l + 1`), it performs the operation and updates the array.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array. It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to the square of its length. If so, it calls `func_1` to update the subarray. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Base Case Handling**: `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and updates the array if necessary.
   - **Recursive Processing**: `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` work together to ensure that the subarray is processed correctly, either by setting it to the MEX or by recursively processing smaller subarrays.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the sum of the array is maximized by either setting the subarray to the MEX or by recursively processing subarrays around the maximum element.
   - **Operation Count**: The operations are counted and stored in the `ops` list, ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the array has only one element or when the array is already maximized.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all possible subarrays are considered, and the MEX is correctly calculated and applied.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations. The functions are well-structured and handle all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
