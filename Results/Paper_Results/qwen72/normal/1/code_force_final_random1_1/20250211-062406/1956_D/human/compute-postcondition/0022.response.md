The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are non-negative integers, and they satisfy the condition 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where `a` is a list of integers. The function returns the maximum sum that can be obtained from the subarray defined by the indices `l` and `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). It returns the maximum sum that can be obtained from the subarray of the list `a` defined by the indices `l` and `r`.**
