### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### 1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
- **Original Assessment**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- **Analysis**: This is correct. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` should pass the `ops` list to `func_1` to ensure that the operations are recorded correctly. The current implementation will indeed cause a `NameError`.

#### 2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
- **Original Assessment**: The MEX calculation in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the current implementation sets the value to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the correct MEX.
- **Analysis**: This is also correct. The MEX calculation should be done using a set to track the presence of integers in the subarray and finding the smallest missing non-negative integer. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that `r - l + 1` is the MEX, which is not always true.

#### 3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
- **Original Assessment**: The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not a valid check for determining whether to apply the MEX operation. The correct approach would be to calculate the MEX and then update the subarray accordingly.
- **Analysis**: This is correct. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a valid way to determine whether to apply the MEX operation. The correct approach is to calculate the MEX and update the subarray if the MEX is different from the current value.

#### 4. **Incorrect Base Case in `func_1`**:
- **Original Assessment**: The base case in `func_1` where `l == r` sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0. This is not always the correct MEX value for a single-element subarray.
- **Analysis**: This is correct. The MEX of a single-element subarray should be 0 if the element is 0, and 1 otherwise. The current implementation sets the element to 0 unconditionally, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly calculate the MEX, handle the base case, or manage the operations list properly. These issues prevent the program from solving the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
