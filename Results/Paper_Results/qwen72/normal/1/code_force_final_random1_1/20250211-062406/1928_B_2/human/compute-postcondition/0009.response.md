Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and the product of the last two elements of `arr`, `tem` is now `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `tem` was initially the product of the last two elements of `arr`. After executing the code, `tem` is updated to include the product of the last three elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
