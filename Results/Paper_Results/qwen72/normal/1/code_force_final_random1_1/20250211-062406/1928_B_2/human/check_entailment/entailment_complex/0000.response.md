### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements in an array `a` that can become equal after adding a permutation `p` to `a`.
   - The permutation `p` is a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The main loop runs for `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is the length of the array `a`.
     - `arr` is the sorted list of unique elements in `a`.
     - The program then iterates over each element in `arr` and calculates the maximum number of elements that can become equal by adding a permutation.
     - The key logic is to use the `bisect_left` function to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted `arr`. The difference between this position and the current index `i` gives the count of elements that can become equal.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1()`**: Reads an integer from the input. Used to get the number of test cases and the length of the array.
   - **`func_3()`**: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers. Used to get the elements of the array `a`.
   - **`func_8()`** and **`func_9()`**: These functions are not used in the main program and are irrelevant to the problem.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The main logic uses the `bisect_left` function to efficiently find the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted `arr`.
   - The difference `a - i` gives the count of elements that can become equal.
   - The maximum of these counts is stored in `ans` and printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the array has duplicate elements or when the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently finds the maximum number of elements that can become equal after adding a permutation to the array.

### Correctness:
**True**
