### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_1()` to get the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` again and the array itself using `func_3()`. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - The array is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted. This step ensures that we are working with unique elements in ascending order.
   - The variable `m` is assigned the maximum value in the sorted array, but this value is not used further in the code, so it seems unnecessary.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency**:
   - The program iterates over each element in the sorted array.
   - For each element, it calculates the position where the element plus `n` would fit in the sorted array using `bisect_left`.
   - The difference between this position and the current index gives the count of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The maximum of these counts is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum count for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Variable**: The variable `m` is assigned but never used, which is unnecessary.
- **Edge Cases**: The program assumes that the input is always valid and within the specified constraints. However, it does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when the array is empty or contains only one element. Given the problem constraints, this is generally fine, but it's worth noting.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. The steps are logically sound and follow the problem requirements.
