Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings, nor does it consider the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the input string "mappie". The correct output should be 2 (by deleting the 'p' and 'i' to avoid both "map" and "pie"), but the program will output 2 because it counts "map" once and "pie" once, without considering the optimal deletions.

Another example is the string "mappppie". The correct output should be 2 (by deleting the two 'p's between "map" and "pie"), but the program will output 2 because it only counts the substrings "map" and "pie" once each, without considering the optimal deletions to remove the overlap.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
