Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to a new input string. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The new value of `s` is now the input string provided, and `x` and `y` will be calculated based on this new `s`.
