Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `a` is an input integer where \(1 \leq a\).
- `s` is a new input string.
- `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new string `s`.
- `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input String `s`**: The string `s` is provided as input. This string can contain any characters, including the substrings 'map' and 'pie'.
2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - `x` is the count of the substring 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the count of the substring 'pie' in `s`.
3. **Sum of Counts**: The `print` statement will output the sum of `x` and `y`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`.
- However, we know that `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, and `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.
- The `print` statement will output the sum of these two counts.

### Final Output:
Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
