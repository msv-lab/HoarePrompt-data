Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, this approach does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings, nor does it consider the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". This involves more complex logic, such as using dynamic programming or a sliding window approach to efficiently find the minimum deletions needed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        if i >= 3 and s[i-3:i] == "map":
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-3] + 3)
        if i >= 3 and s[i-3:i] == "pie":
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-3] + 3)
    
    return n - dp[n]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))
```

This program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum length of a beautiful substring that can be formed up to each position in the string. The result is the total length of the string minus the length of the longest beautiful substring that can be formed.
