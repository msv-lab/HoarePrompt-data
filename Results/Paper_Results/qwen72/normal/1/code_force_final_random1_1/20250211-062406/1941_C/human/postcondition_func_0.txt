The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' within `s` and prints the sum of these counts. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the sum of occurrences for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the total number of test cases processed, the last input integer `a`, the last input string `s`, and the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the last `s`.
