Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `s`, `x`) remain unchanged. The value of `y` is now specifically the count of 'pie' in `s`.
