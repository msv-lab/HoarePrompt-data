The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `y`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
