Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer where \(1 \leq a\).
- `s` is an input string.
- `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in `s`.
- `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input String `s`**: The string `s` is provided as input. The exact content of `s` is not specified, but it is a string that can contain any characters.
2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in `s`.
3. **Summing the Counts**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the sum of the number of times 'map' appears in `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in s and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in s)**
