You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input string `s`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` (the set of unique characters in `s`) is 2, the loop prints 'NO' for this iteration. Otherwise, the loop prints 'YES', and if `s` is equal to `b`, it prints `c`; otherwise, it prints `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Single Character Strings**: The program does not handle single character strings correctly. According to the problem description, if the string `s` consists of a single character, the output should be "NO" because it is impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string. However, the program will incorrectly output "YES" and then attempt to sort the string, which will result in the same string being printed.

2. **Incorrect Condition for "NO" Output**: The program checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is 2 (`if len(a) == 2:`) to decide whether to output "NO". This condition is incorrect. For example, the string "xxxxy" has a set of characters of length 2, but it is possible to rearrange it to "xxyxx" which is different from the original string. Therefore, the program will incorrectly output "NO" for this case.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The program uses sorting to generate a new string. While this can sometimes produce a different string, it is not guaranteed to do so. For example, if the input string is "abab", sorting it will produce "aabb", which is different from the original string, but the reverse sorted string "bbaa" is also different. The program does not handle this correctly and may output the same string if the sorted version happens to be the same as the original.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the input string is "abc", the sorted version "abc" is the same as the original string, but the reverse sorted version "cba" is different. The program will incorrectly output "abc" instead of "cba".

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Check if the string length is 1 and output "NO" if true.
- Check if all characters in the string are the same and output "NO" if true.
- Use a more robust method to generate a different string, such as swapping the first two characters if they are different, or using a different permutation algorithm.
