Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters, no further changes are made. Otherwise, the set `a` contains more than 2 unique characters or fewer than 2 unique characters, `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, `s` is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b` and is not sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` (the set of unique characters in `s`) is 2, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `b`, `s` is sorted in ascending order. If `s` is not equal to `b`, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` (the set of unique characters in `s`) is 2, the variables retain their initial values. If the length of `a` is not 2, and if `b` (the sorted version of `s` in ascending order) is equal to `s`, then the variables also retain their initial values. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
