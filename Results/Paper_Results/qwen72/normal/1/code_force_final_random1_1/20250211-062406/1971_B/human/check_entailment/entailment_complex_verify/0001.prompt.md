You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input string `s`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` (the set of unique characters in `s`) is 2, the loop prints 'NO' for this iteration. Otherwise, the loop prints 'YES', and if `s` is equal to `b`, it prints `c`; otherwise, it prints `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Set Creation**: For each string `s`, it creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. This helps in determining the number of unique characters in `s`.
3. **Check for Unique Characters**:
   - If the length of the set `a` is 2, it prints 'NO'. This is because if there are exactly two unique characters, any rearrangement will still result in a string that is either the same as `s` or its reverse.
   - If the length of the set `a` is not 2, it proceeds to the next steps.
4. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - It sorts the string `s` to create `b` and sorts it in reverse order to create `c`.
   - It checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`.
     - If `b` is equal to `s`, it prints the reversed string `c`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Analysis:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - For strings with exactly two unique characters, the program correctly outputs 'NO'.
  - For strings with more than two unique characters, the program attempts to create a different string by sorting or reversing the sorted string.
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic of checking the length of the set `a` is correct for identifying strings with exactly two unique characters.
  - The approach of sorting and reversing the string ensures that the resulting string is different from the original string `s` when possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
