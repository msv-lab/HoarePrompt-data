Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`. The set `a` contains more than 2 unique characters or fewer than 2 unique characters, `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, `s` is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b` and is not sorted in ascending order.***
