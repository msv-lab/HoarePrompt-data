The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
