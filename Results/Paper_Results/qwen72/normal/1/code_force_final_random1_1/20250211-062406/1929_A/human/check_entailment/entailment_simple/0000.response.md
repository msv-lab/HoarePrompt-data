Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array after potentially rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

However, the key insight here is that the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order. This is because sorting the array maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements. Specifically, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array, as all other intermediate differences cancel out.

Given this, the program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array. This approach is correct for the problem's requirements.

Let's verify the logic with the example provided:

1. **Test Case 1**: 
   - Input: `3`
   - Array: `[2, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3`
   - Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Sorted Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Output: `0`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5`
   - Array: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Sorted Array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
   - Output: `57`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4`
   - Array: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Sorted Array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2`
   - Array: `[2, 1]`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case as shown in the examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
