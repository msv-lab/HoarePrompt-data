Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `ntest` is equal to `t`.
- `itest` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `ntest` must be greater than 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - Since `a` is sorted, the smallest element in the list is `a[0]` and the largest element is `a[len(a) - 1]`.

2. **Expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**:
   - This expression calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.
   - In other words, it computes the range of the list `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] (where a[len(a) - 1] is the largest element in the sorted list `a` and a[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list `a`)**

This means the output will be the range of the list `a`, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
