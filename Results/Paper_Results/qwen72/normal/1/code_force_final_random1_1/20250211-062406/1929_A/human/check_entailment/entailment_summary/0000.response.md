Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The key insight is that to maximize this sum, the largest and smallest elements should be placed alternately to maximize the differences. However, the provided solution simply sorts the array and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements. Instead, it only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements after optimal rearrangement.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to sort the array and then place the largest and smallest elements alternately to maximize the sum of the differences. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between the elements placed in this alternating pattern.

Given the provided solution, it does not follow the correct logic to achieve the desired result.

Correctness: **False**
