Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Mathematically, this is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Simplifying the Expression**: The expression for the beauty can be expanded as:
   \[
   (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots + (a_n - a_{n-1})
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   a_n - a_1
   \]
   This means the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last element (largest) and the first element (smallest) of the sorted array.

4. **Verification**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array.
   - The difference between these two elements is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 500\) and \(2 \le n \le 100\).
   - It correctly processes arrays with duplicate elements, as seen in the second test case where the beauty is 0.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the array, sorting it, and printing the difference between the largest and smallest elements.
   - The state of the program is correctly described at each step, ensuring that the logic is followed as intended.

Given the above reasoning and the confirmation from the annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Final: **True**
