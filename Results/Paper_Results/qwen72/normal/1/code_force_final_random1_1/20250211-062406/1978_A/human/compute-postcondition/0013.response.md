Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `t` has been decremented to 0 because the loop runs `t` times, and each iteration reduces the remaining count of `t`.
- **`_` is a throwaway variable**: The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop and does not retain any specific value after the loop completes.
- **`n` is an input integer**: The variable `n` is read from the input during each iteration of the loop, so it will have the value of the last input integer provided.
- **`nums` is a list of integers from the input**: The variable `nums` is a list of integers read from the input during each iteration of the loop, so it will contain the list of integers from the last input provided.

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
