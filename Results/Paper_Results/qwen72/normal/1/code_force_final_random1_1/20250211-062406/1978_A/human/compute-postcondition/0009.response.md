The only objects in the loop head are the throwaway variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (but will be decremented by 1), `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.** 

However, to be precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from the previous iteration), `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
