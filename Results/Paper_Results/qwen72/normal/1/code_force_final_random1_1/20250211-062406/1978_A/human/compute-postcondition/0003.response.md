The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`.

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `_` remains a throwaway variable with no specific value.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `nums` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
