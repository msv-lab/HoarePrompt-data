The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `L` is an empty list. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero, `L` is an empty list**
