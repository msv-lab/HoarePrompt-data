Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least one element, `tot` is the next element in `L` plus `a`, `pow` is 4, and `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0. `a` is the next element in `L`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
