Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m, m, m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and must be greater than 1 before the subtraction.**

Explanation:
- The list `L` initially contains two elements, both equal to `m`.
- The code `L.append(m)` adds another element to the list `L`, which is also `m`.
- Therefore, `L` now contains three elements, all equal to `m`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `n` remains `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`, and it must be greater than 1 before the subtraction.
