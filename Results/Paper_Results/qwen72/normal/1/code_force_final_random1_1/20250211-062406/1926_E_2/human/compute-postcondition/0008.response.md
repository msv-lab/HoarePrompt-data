To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition.

### Program State:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `n` must be non-zero
- `L` is [m]
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`
- `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`

### Loop Condition:
```
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State of `n`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be non-zero after this update.

2. **Adjusting `n`:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` remains non-zero after the update.
   - Since `n` is an integer, the expression `(n + 1) // 2` will always result in an integer.
   - If `n` is positive, subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from `n` should still leave `n` non-zero for the loop to continue.

3. **Ensuring Non-Zero `n`:**
   - Given that `n` is non-zero and `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that the result of this operation is still non-zero.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `(n + 1) // 2` is 3, and `n` becomes 2, which is non-zero.
   - If `n` is 2, then `(n + 1) // 2` is 1, and `n` becomes 1, which is non-zero.
   - If `n` is 1, then `(n + 1) // 2` is 1, and `n` becomes 0, which is zero and the loop will terminate.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be such that after the update `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `n` remains non-zero.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 before the update.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`**
