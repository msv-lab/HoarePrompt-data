Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` which is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- Since `n` was previously updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `m` is calculated as `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
