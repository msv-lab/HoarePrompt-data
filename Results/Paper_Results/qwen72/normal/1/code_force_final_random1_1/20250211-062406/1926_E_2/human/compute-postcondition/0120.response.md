Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `k` is the second integer input by the user.
- `s` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` is `n`.
- `h` is `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

### Explanation:
- The value of `k` is the second integer input by the user.
- The expression `2 * k - 1` calculates twice the value of `k` and then subtracts 1 from it.
- Since `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), the value of `2 * k - 1` will be a valid integer.

### Output:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the second integer input by the user and k â‰¤ (n + 1) // 2)**
