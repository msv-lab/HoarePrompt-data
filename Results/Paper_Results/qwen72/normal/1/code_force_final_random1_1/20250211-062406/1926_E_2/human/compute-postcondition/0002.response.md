The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the user input, which is split and converted to integers. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a placeholder. The values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
