Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `L` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `tot` is 0.
- `pow` is 1.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `pow` is 1.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `k` is a value such that `tot < k <= tot + a`. Given `tot` is 0, this simplifies to `0 < k <= a`.

2. **Expression Inside the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `pow` is 1.
     - `tot` is 0.
     - Therefore, the expression becomes `1 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1)`.
     - Simplifying further: `1 * (2 * k - 1)`.

3. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression is `2 * k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is a value such that `0 < k <= a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is a value such that 0 < k <= a)**
