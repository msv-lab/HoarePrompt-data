Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `pow` is 8, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pow` is updated from 4 to 8 because `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `L`, `a`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
