The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**
