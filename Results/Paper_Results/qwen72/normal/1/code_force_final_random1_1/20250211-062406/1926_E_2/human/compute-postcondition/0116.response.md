The code assigns the value of `k - g` to the variable `f`. Given the initial state, `k` and `g` are already defined, so the calculation of `f` is straightforward.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `k` is the second integer input by the user.
- `s` is `k`.
- `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.
- `d` is 0.
- `h` is 0.
- `p` is `i`.
- `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left( \left( \frac{n + 1}{2^j} + 1 \right) // 2 \right)\).
- `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

The new variable `f` is calculated as `k - g`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left( \left( \frac{n + 1}{2^j} + 1 \right) // 2 \right)\), `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` is `k - g`.**
