The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`.

- `n` and `k` are both assigned new values based on the input.
- The initial state variables `t`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers with all its elements processed, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\).**
