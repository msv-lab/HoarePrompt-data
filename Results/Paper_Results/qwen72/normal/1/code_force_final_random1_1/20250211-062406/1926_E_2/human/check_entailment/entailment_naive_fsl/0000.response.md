Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the multiplier is greater than 2. According to the problem description, after laying down the odd-numbered cards, Vladislav should lay down cards that are multiples of 2, 3, 4, etc., times an odd number. However, the program only considers multiples of 2 and does not correctly handle higher multipliers. For example, for `n = 34` and `k = 14`, the correct output should be `27` (since 27 is the 14th card laid down), but the program will not produce this output because it does not correctly account for the 3 times an odd number step.
