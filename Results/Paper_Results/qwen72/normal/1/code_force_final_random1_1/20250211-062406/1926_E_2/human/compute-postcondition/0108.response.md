Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values \((n + 1) // 2\) calculated during each iteration until `n` becomes 0 for each test case, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for each test case, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the outer loop, the value of `t` is decremented to 0 because the loop runs `t` times.
- **`n` is 0**: For each test case, the inner loop continues until `n` becomes 0, so `n` is 0 at the end of each test case.
- **`k` is an input integer**: The value of `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is used for comparison but not modified.
- **`L` is a list containing the sequence of values \((n + 1) // 2\) calculated during each iteration until `n` becomes 0 for each test case**: The list `L` accumulates the values of `m` (which is \((n + 1) // 2\)) for each iteration of the inner loop until `n` becomes 0.
- **`tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for each test case**: The variable `tot` keeps track of the cumulative sum of the elements in `L` for each test case.
- **`pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) for each test case**: The variable `pow` is updated by multiplying by 2 for each element added to `L`, resulting in \(2^{\text{length of } L}\).

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
