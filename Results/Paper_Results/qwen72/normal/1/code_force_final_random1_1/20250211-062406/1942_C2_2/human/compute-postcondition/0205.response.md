Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the sum of all elements in `even`, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division) plus the sum of half of each element in `even` (integer division), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, `ans`, `y`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
