To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `i` is `x - 1`
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`
- `gap` is the last element in `odd`
- `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order
- `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order
- `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd`
- `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division)

### Loop Head:
```python
for gap in even:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `gap` and the list `even`.
- For the loop to execute, `even` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `even`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `even` must have at least one element.

### Final State:
- `i` remains `x - 1`
- `next_elem` remains `a[0] + n`
- `gap` is the last element in `odd` (this is not directly relevant to the loop head)
- `odd` remains a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order
- `even` must have at least one element
- `ans` remains increased by the sum of all elements in `odd`
- `y` remains decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division)

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd`, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division)**
