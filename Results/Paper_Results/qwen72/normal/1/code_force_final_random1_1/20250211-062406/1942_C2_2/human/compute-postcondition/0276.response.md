Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * y`, `odd` contains all the gaps that were greater than 1 and odd and must have at least 1 element, `even` contains all the gaps that were greater than 0 and even, with `even` now sorted in ascending order, `odd` is also sorted in ascending order, `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`, `y` is `y - gap // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value.
- The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `gap // 2` from its current value.
- All other variables (`i`, `t1`, `t2`, `odd`, `even`, `gap`) remain unchanged.
