The code snippet `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the integer division result of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2 to the list `tmp`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- The difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `a` is not equal to 2.
- The difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even.
- `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.

Let's assume `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are specific values that satisfy these conditions. For example, if `a[i - 1] = 4` and `a[i] = 8`, then the difference `a[i] - a[i - 1] = 4`, which is even and not equal to 2.

The calculation `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` would be `4 // 2 = 2`.

Thus, `tmp` will now contain the value `2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `a` is not equal to 2, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
