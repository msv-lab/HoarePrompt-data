Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `next_elem` based on the condition `i == x - 1`. Since `i` is `x - 1`, the condition is true, and `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
