The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected to accept the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the total number of vertices.
- `x`: An integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `y`: An integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, representing an additional parameter (the exact role of which is not specified).
- A list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but typically, such a function would process the given parameters and return some result based on the input. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume that the function processes the input and returns a result relevant to the problem context, such as a solution to a problem involving the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It processes these parameters and returns a result based on the input, likely related to the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
