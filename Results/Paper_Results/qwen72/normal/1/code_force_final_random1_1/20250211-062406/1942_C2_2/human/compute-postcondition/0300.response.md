Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * y` (where `y` was updated based on the condition), `odd` and `even` remain the same, `y` is `0`, `gap` is the next element in `even`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to 0.
- The values of `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `odd`, and `even` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * y`, where `y` was previously updated based on the condition `y >= gap // 2`.
- The value of `gap` remains the next element in `even`.
