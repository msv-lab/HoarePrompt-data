Output State: **`i` remains `x - 1`, `t1` remains `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` remains `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is now `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`, `odd` remains the same, `even` remains the same, `y` is now `0`, `gap` remains the second element in `even`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `odd`, `even`, and `gap`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
