The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within a certain range, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are also integers within their respective ranges. The code does not affect `t`, `tt`, or `ii`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0.**
