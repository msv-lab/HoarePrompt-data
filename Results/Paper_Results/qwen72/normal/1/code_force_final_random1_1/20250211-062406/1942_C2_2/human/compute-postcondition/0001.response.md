The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tt`. For the loop to execute, `tt` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but this does not directly affect the loop's execution based on the loop head. The variable `ii` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
