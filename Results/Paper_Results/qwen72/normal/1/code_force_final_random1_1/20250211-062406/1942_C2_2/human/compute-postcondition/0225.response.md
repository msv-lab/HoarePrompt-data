The code snippet updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `t1` will be `(a[2] + 1) % n`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically, `x` is still greater than 2, `t2` is still `(a[1] + 2) % n`, and the condition about `t1` not being in `st` and `t2` being in `st` affecting `ans` remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
