The value of `t1` is calculated as `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(a[0] + 1) % n`. Since `x` must be greater than 0, and assuming `a[0]` is a valid element in the list `a`, the value of `t1` will be `(a[0] + 1) % n`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`**
