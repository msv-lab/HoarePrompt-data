Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
