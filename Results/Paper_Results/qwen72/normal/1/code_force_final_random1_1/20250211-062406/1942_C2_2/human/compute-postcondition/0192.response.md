Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element. If `y` < `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the previous `gap` plus `2 * y`, `y` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the previous `gap`, and `y` is decreased by the previous `gap // 2`.***
