Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`. All other variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`) remain unchanged. The list `resultats` now contains a single element, which is `-1`.
