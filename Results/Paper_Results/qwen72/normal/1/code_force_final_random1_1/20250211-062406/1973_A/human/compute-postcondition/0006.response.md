Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element which is -1. Otherwise, `resultats` remains an empty list.***
