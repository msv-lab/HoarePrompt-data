Reasoning:

1. **Odd Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the total points are odd. Since each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 for a win/loss, 2 for a draw), the total points must be even. If the total points are odd, the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match (regardless of the outcome) contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Invalid Total Matches Check**: The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. This check is necessary because:
   - A maximum of 3 matches can be played among 3 players (each pair playing once).
   - The highest score a player can achieve is equal to the total number of matches played (since a win gives 2 points).

4. **Egalites Calculation**: The program calculates `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others should be accounted for by wins. The remaining points are attributed to draws. If `egalites` is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, and the program correctly returns `-1`.

5. **Final Egalites Calculation**: The final number of draws is calculated as `egalites // 2`. This is correct because each draw contributes 2 points to the total score.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
