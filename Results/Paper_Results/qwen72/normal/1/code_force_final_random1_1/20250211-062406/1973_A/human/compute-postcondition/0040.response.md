The provided code snippet updates the value of `egalites` based on the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `egalites` is recalculated using the given formula.
- The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, and `total_matchs` remain unchanged.
- The condition checks for `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs` do not affect the current calculation of `egalites`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples.
- `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3).
- `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- `resultats` is a list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `egalites` is updated to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is a list.**
