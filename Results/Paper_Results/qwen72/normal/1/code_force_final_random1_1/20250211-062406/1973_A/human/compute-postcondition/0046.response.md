The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cas_de_test`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), representing the scores of the three players in each test case.

The function returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is determined as follows:
- If the sum of the tuple elements (`p_1 + p_2 + p_3`) is odd, the result is `-1`.
- If the sum is even, further checks are made to determine if the result should be `-1` or the calculated value of `egalites` divided by 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers representing player scores. It returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element is `-1` if the sum of the scores in the corresponding tuple is odd, or the value of `egalites` divided by 2 if the sum is even.**
