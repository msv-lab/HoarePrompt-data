Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`.** 

The code assigns the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to the variable `total_points`. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, and `resultats` remain unchanged.
