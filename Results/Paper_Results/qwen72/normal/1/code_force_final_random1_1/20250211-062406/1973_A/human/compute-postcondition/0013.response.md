Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element which is -1. Otherwise, `resultats` remains an empty list. `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` now contains one element which is -1. `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. The current value of `egalites` is less than 0.**
