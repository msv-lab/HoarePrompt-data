Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: The total points must be even because each game, whether a win/loss or a draw, contributes 2 points in total. The code correctly checks this with `total_points % 2 != 0`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The code checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is necessary because:
   - A maximum of 3 matches can be played among 3 players.
   - The highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches.

4. **Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is:
   - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - This formula aims to account for the points that are not from wins (i.e., points from draws). However, it needs to be validated against the problem constraints.

5. **Negative Draws Check**: The code ensures that the number of draws is non-negative by checking `if egalites < 0`.

6. **Final Result**: The number of draws is divided by 2 to get the actual number of draw matches, which is then appended to the results list.

### Re-evaluation of the Draws Calculation Formula

The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is derived from the idea that the points from wins are subtracted from the total points to find the points from draws. However, this formula can be simplified and verified:

- The total points from wins can be calculated as `2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- The remaining points, which are from draws, should be `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.

However, this formula can be incorrect in some edge cases. A more robust approach is to consider the following:

- The total number of matches is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the remaining points after accounting for the minimum number of wins are distributed as draws.

### Corrected Draws Calculation

A more accurate way to calculate the number of draws is to use the following logic:
- Calculate the total number of wins: `wins = (p3 - p2) + (p3 - p1)`.
- The remaining points are from draws: `draw_points = total_points - 2 * wins`.
- The number of draws is `draws = draw_points // 2`.

### Re-evaluating the Test Cases

Let's re-evaluate the test cases using the corrected logic:

1. **Test Case (0, 0, 0)**:
   - Total points: 0
   - Wins: 0
   - Draw points: 0
   - Draws: 0
   - Result: 0 (Correct)

2. **Test Case (0, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: 2
   - Wins: 0
   - Draw points: 2
   - Draws: 1
   - Result: 1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case (0, 2, 3)**:
   - Total points: 5 (Odd, invalid)
   - Result: -1 (Correct)

4. **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**:
   - Total points: 9 (Odd, invalid)
   - Result: -1 (Correct)

5. **Test Case (3, 4, 5)**:
   - Total points: 12
   - Wins: 2
   - Draw points: 8
   - Draws: 4
   - Result: 4 (Incorrect, should be 6)

6. **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**:
   - Total points: 12
   - Wins: 8
   - Draw points: -4 (Invalid)
   - Result: -1 (Correct)

7. **Test Case (0, 0, 6)**:
   - Total points: 6
   - Wins: 3
   - Draw points: 0
   - Draws: 0
   - Result: 0 (Incorrect, should be 2)

### Conclusion

The original assessment identified a logical issue in the feasibility check and the draws calculation formula. The corrected logic for calculating draws is more robust and should be used. Given the issues identified, the original assessment is correct in identifying the logical errors in the program.

Final: **False**
