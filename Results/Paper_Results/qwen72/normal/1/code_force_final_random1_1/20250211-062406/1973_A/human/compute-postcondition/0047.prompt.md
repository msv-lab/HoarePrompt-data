You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), representing the number of test cases. cas_de_test is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), representing the scores of the three players in each test case.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with `t` tuples, and `resultats` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `resultats` corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
    #- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (`total_points`) is odd, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
    #- If `total_points` is even, `total_matchs` is calculated as `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
    #- If neither of the above conditions is met, `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `egalites // 2`.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is calculated based on the conditions specified: if the sum of the tuple elements is odd, the result is `-1`; if the sum is even, further checks are made to determine if the result should be `-1` or the calculated value of `egalites` divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers representing player scores. It returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element is `-1` if the sum of the scores in the corresponding tuple is odd, or the value of `egalites` divided by 2 if the sum is even.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is calculated based on the conditions specified: if the sum of the tuple elements is odd, the result is `-1`; if the sum is even, further checks are made to determine if the result should be `-1` or the calculated value of `egalites` divided by 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
