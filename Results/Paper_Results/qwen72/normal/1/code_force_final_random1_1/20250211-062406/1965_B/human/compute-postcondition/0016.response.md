Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix.
- The initial state specifies that `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `k` is not equal to 1.
- After executing the code, `bk` now holds the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
