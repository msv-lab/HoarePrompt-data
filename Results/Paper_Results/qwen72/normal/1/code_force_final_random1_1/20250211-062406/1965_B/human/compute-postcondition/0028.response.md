The code snippet `ans.append(2 * k + 1)` appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, or `i`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` is a list that initially contains powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)` and `k + 1`.
- The new element `2 * k + 1` is appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state of `ans` is the original list with the additional element `2 * k + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
