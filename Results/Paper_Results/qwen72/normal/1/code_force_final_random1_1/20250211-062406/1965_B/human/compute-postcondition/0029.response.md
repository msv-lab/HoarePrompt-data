To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `lk` is less than `l`.
   - The variable `i` will start at `lk` and iterate up to but not including `l`.

3. **Adjust States to Ensure Loop Execution:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `lk` must be less than `l`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be `lk`.

### Given Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`.
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`.
- `2 ≤ k ≤ n`.
- `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of `b`.
- `k` is not equal to 1.
- `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
- `lk` is the length of `bk`.
- `i` is `lk - 2`.
- `lk` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `lk` must be less than `l`.
- The initial value of `i` should be `lk`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is `lk`, `lk` must be less than `l`**.
