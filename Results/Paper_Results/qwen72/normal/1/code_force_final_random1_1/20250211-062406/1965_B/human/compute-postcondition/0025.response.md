Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `lk - 1` times, where `lk` is the length of the binary string of `k`.
- Each iteration appends `2^i` to the list `ans`, where `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`.
- The variable `i` will be `lk - 2` after the last iteration.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
