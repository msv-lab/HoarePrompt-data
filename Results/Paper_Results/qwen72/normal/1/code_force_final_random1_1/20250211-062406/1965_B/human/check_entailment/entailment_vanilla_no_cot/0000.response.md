Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The function `func_14` attempts to solve the problem by constructing a sequence based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`. However, the logic used to construct the sequence is flawed. Specifically, the part where it tries to handle the case when `k == 1` and the part where it constructs the sequence for other values of `k` does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`.

2. The function `func_14` does not correctly handle the constraint that the sequence should have a size of at most 25. The current implementation may generate sequences that are longer than 25 elements, especially when `n` is large.

3. The function `func_14` does not guarantee that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. The construction of the sequence is not robust enough to ensure this property for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

4. The function `func_14` returns a string directly, which is then written to the standard output. This approach is not efficient and could lead to incorrect formatting of the output, especially in the context of multiple test cases.

To fix these issues, the program would need a more careful and systematic approach to constructing the sequence `a` that meets all the problem's requirements.
