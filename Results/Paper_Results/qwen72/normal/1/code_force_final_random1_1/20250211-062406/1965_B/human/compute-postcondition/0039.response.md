Functionality: ** The function `func_14` takes no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_7` to obtain two integers `n` and `k` such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. It then processes these values to generate a specific output. If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the string '1\n2'. For other values of `n` and `k` where `k == 1`, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k != 1`, it constructs a list `ans` starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. Finally, the function returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. **
