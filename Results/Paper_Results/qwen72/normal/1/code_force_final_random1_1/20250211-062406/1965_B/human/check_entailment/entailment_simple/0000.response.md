Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific criteria regarding subsequences and their sums. Let's break down the correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k != 1`:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k - 1`.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
     - It then appends powers of 2 from the length of `k` to the length of `n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:

- **Subsequence Sum Constraints**:
  - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully constructing the sequence.
  - For all other values `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v != k`, the program ensures there is a subsequence that sums to `v`.

- **Sequence Construction**:
  - When `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]` avoids any subsequence summing to 1 while covering all other values up to `n`.
  - When `k != 1`, the sequence starts with powers of 2, ensuring that all values up to `k - 1` can be formed. It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence is exactly `k - 1`. The values `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to cover higher values and avoid forming a subsequence that sums to `k`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases like `n == 2` and `k == 1` correctly.
  - The sequence construction ensures that the length of the sequence is at most 25, as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a sequence that meets the specified conditions. It handles all edge cases and ensures the sequence properties are maintained.

Correctness: **True**
