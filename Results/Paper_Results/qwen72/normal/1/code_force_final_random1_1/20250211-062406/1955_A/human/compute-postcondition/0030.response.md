Functionality: ** The function reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set containing three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each set, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy `A` yogurts, considering both the regular price `B` and the promotional price `C` for two yogurts. If the promotional price for two yogurts is less than twice the regular price, it uses the promotional price to minimize the cost. If `A` is odd, it buys one additional yogurt at the regular price. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated costs for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
