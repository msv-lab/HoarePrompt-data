Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30, representing the number of yogurts to buy, the price per yogurt, and the promotional price for two yogurts, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be the last set of inputs read from the user. If `B * 2 < C`, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set containing three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each set, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy `A` yogurts, considering both the regular price `B` and the promotional price `C` for two yogurts. If the promotional price for two yogurts is less than twice the regular price, it uses the promotional price to minimize the cost. If `A` is odd, it buys one additional yogurt at the regular price. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated costs for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
