Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output the result of multiplying the integer `A` by the integer `B`.
- Since `A` and `B` are provided by user input, their specific values are not known in advance.
- Therefore, the output will be the product of the two integers `A` and `B`.

### Final Output:
Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers provided by the user input)**
