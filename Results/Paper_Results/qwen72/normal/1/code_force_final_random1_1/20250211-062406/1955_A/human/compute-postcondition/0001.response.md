The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` using the `map` function to convert them into integers. The input is expected to be three space-separated integers. The variable `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
