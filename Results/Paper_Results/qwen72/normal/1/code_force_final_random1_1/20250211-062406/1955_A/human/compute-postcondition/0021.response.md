Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2. The other variables (`X`) are not mentioned and thus remain unchanged.
