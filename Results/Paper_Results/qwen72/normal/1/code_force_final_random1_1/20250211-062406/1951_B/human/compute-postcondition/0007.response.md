Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is an empty list if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is a list containing the index `i`; `c` is 0 if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 1; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0.***
