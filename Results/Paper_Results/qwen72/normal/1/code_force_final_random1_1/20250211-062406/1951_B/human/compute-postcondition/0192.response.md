Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s` after the last element checked, `j` is the index of the next element in `s` (or `len(s) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, and `z` is 1. If `i == h`, `ans1` is 3 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i > h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans1` remains 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i < h`, `ans1` is 3 if `z` is 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `z` is not 1, `ans1` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.***
