Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `ind` is a list containing the index 2; `c` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
