You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. Since `n` is the length of the list `a` and is between 2 and 100,000, the program returns a value between 1 and 99,999.

Case_2: The program returns 13.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the element in list `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is 14, and `ind[0]` is the index of the element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Since `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k` and not 0, the program calculates the difference between `k` and `ind[0]` and the difference between `ind[0]` and 1, and returns the larger of these two differences.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, where `ind[1]` is the second element in the list `ind` (which contains indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`), and `k` is 14.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are indices of two elements in the list `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is not 0.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the first element in the list `ind` (which is not 0), and `k` is 14.
