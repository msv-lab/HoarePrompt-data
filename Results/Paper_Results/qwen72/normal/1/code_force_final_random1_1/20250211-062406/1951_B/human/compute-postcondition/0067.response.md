The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `s` will contain a list of integers derived from the input. The values of `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input.**
