The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and each element `a_i` is unique and within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The function returns different values based on specific conditions:

- **Case_1:** The function returns the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. This value is between 1 and 99,999.
- **Case_2:** The function returns 13.
- **Case_3:** The function returns the value of `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the element in list `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.
- **Case_4:** The function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is 14, and `ind[0]` is the index of the element in `a` that is greater than `x`. `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k` and not 0.
- **Case_5:** The function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, where `ind[1]` is the second element in the list `ind` (which contains indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`), and `k` is 14.
- **Case_6:** The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are indices of two elements in the list `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is not 0.
- **Case_7:** The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the first element in the list `ind` (which is not 0), and `k` is 14.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of unique integers and returns a value based on specific conditions involving the length of the list, indices of elements greater than a certain value `x`, and a constant `k` set to 14. The possible return values include `n - 1`, 13, `ind[0] - 1`, the maximum or minimum of certain differences, depending on the conditions met.**
