Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is a list containing the index `i` (which is 1); `c` is 1; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ind.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `ind`. Since `i` is 1 and the condition for adding `i` to `ind` is that `a[i]` is greater than `x`, the list `ind` now contains the index 1. The variable `c` is set to 1 because `a[i]` is greater than `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
