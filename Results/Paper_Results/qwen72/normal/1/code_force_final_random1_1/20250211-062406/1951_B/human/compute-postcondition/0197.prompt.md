You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and all a_i's are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        h = s[0]
        
        j = -1
        
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        p = j
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans1 = 0
        
        s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
        
        z = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that have been executed, `n` and `k` retain their last assigned values from the final iteration, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the first element of `s` as it was at the start of the final iteration, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `z == 1` before encountering an element greater than `h`, and `z` is 1 if any element in `s` was equal to `h` and the condition `z == 1` was met; otherwise, it remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows (n), the index of your cow (k), and a list of Cowdeforces ratings (a) for the cows. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given output description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
