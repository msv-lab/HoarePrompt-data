Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where the first element and the element at position `k-1` are swapped, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `z` is 1 if any element in `s` was equal to `h` and the condition `z == 1` was met; otherwise, it remains 0, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `z == 1` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is 0, and the values of `s` and `h` remain unchanged.**
