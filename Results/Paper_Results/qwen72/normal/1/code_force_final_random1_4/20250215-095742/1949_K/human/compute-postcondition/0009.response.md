Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations:**
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9.
- `group_a` contains the first `na` elements from `numbers`.
- `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements from `numbers`.
- `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements from `numbers`.
- `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`.
- `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`.
- `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.
