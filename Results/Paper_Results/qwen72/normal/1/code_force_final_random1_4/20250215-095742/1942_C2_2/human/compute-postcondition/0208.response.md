Output State: **`_` is incremented, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(even)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by 1, `st`, `next_elem` remain unchanged, `gap` is the last element of `even`, `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, and `y` is `y - sum([gap // 2 for gap in even])`.**
