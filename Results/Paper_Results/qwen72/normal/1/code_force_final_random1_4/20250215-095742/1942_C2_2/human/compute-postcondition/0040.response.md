Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop. If the sum of the smallest element in `a` and `n` minus the largest element in `a` is equal to 2, then `ans` is incremented by 1, and `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution. Otherwise, if the sum of the smallest element in `a` and `n` minus the largest element in `a` is even and `y` is greater than the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` now contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If neither of these conditions is met, the values of `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.***
