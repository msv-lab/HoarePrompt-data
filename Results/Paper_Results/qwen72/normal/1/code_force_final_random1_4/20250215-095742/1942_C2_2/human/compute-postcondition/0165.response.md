Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * y`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is now sorted in ascending order, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value, which was previously `ans + gap`.
- The new value of `ans` is therefore `ans + gap + 2 * y`.
- All other variables (`x`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` remains `y - (gap // 2)`.
