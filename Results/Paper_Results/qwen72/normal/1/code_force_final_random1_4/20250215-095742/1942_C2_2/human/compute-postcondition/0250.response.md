Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `i` is `x - 1` otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `x` is greater than 2.
- The value of `next_elem` is determined by the condition: if `i` (which is 2) is `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[3]`; otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- The value of `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[2] - 1`.
- The conditions for adding `gap` to the `odd` or `even` lists remain unchanged. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, it is added to the `odd` list. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, it is added to the `even` list. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.
