Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, the difference between the last two elements of `a` is not equal to 2, the difference between the last two elements of `a` is even, and `y` is now `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` from its current value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
