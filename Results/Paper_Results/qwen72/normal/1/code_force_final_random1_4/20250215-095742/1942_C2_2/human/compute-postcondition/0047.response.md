The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.**
