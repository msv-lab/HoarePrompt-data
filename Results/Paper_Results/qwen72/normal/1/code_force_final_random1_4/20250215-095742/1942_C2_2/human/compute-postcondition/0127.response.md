Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` and the total number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus the sum of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, plus 1, plus the original value of `y`. `tmp` will contain the values of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one. `y` will be decremented by the sum of half the differences minus one for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` now contains the values of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, and now also contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`.**
