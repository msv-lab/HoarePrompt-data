Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `a[1] - a[0] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `tmp` contains one element if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is met, otherwise `tmp` remains empty. If the condition is met, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)` and `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.***
