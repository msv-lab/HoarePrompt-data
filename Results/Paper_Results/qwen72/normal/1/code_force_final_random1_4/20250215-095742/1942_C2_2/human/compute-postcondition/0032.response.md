Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `tmp` is a list containing the values added during the loop execution, and the sum of the smallest element in `a` and `n` minus the largest element in `a` is equal to 2.**
