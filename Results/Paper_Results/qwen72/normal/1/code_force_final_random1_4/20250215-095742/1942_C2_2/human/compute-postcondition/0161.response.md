Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `cons` based on the input parameters and the list of integers. The function then prints the calculated `cons` value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case, and the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values as specified in the input. **
