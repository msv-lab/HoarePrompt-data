To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of `val`, as this is the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- `val` contains `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`.

For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `val` must not be empty.

State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least one element**.
