Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order. `x` is the final value of `x` from the initial state, `i` is `x`, `c` is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`, `val` contains `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, and `sx` is the sum of 1 for each `c` that equals 1 in `val`. The values of `n`, `t`, `y`, `cons`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least one element; `c` is the integer part of `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`; `sx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val`; `c` is the integer part of `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`; if `y < c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + (y - c) * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sx` is `sx + i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val` after the current `i`; `c` is the integer part of the new `i` divided by 2. `y` is updated to `y - c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sx` is now `sx + i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
