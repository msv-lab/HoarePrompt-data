Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least one element, `ans` is `ans + gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + sum(odd) + 4 * 0 + 2 * 0`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` remains as `y - gap // 2` (or 0 if `y < gap // 2` after the decrement), and `ans` is updated to `ans + sum(odd) + 4 * y`.**
