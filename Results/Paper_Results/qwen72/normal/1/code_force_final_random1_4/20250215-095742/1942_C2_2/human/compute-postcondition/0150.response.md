Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val` after the current `i`; `c` is the integer part of the new `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`; `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.
- The values of `val`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` is also unchanged in this snippet, but it will be used in the calculation of `sx`.
- All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid.
