The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input
- `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- The second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen
- `tt` must be greater than 0
- `ii` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` will contain a list of integers read from the user input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the user input.**
