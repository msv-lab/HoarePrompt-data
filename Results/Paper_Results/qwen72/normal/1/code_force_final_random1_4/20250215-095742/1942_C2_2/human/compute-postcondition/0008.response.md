Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, and the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is 2.**
