The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given the initial state, `y` is less than half of the first element of `odd`. The values of `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st`, `t`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is `ans + 2 * y`, all other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `st`, `t`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged, and `y` is less than half of the first element of `odd`.**
