Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)` if `(a[1] - a[0]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged. The second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition is met, otherwise `tmp` remains empty, and `ans` is incremented by `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.***
