Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - (gap // 2))` if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap`. `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `even`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element. If `y < gap // 2`, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.***
