Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first two and the last two elements of the array for specific conditions without considering the overall feasibility of making all elements zero through the allowed operations. The conditions checked in the code are not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros. Specifically, the operations involve decrementing three consecutive elements, and the solution needs to account for the cumulative effect of these operations across the entire array, not just the boundary elements.

A correct approach would need to consider the total sum of the array and the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements, among other factors, to ensure that the operations can indeed reduce the array to all zeros. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
