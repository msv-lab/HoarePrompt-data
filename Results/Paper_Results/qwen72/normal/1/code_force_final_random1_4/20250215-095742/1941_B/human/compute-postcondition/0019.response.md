Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers from the input. If `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` or `(b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
