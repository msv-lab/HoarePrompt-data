Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, the variable `a` has been assigned the value of `n` (the number of elements in the list `b`). For each list `b` of integers read from the input, if the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then "NO" is printed. Otherwise, "YES" is printed. The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case independently.**
