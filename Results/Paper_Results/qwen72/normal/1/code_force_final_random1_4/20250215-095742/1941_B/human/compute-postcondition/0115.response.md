Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is `t - 1`, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[n-3]`, `stop` is `True` if any `a[i]` is less than 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `stop` remains `False`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `numTest` is still `t - 1`.
- `_` remains 2.
- `n` is still an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `a` has been modified such that the elements from index 0 to `n-3` are all set to 0.
- The element at index `n-2` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
- The element at index `n-1` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-3`, the value of `a[i]` is subtracted by the sum of `opNums` from 0 to `i`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-4`, the value of `a[i + 1]` is subtracted by the sum of `2 * opNums` from 0 to `i + 1` plus `2 * a[n-3]`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-5`, the value of `a[i + 2]` is subtracted by the sum of `opNums` from 0 to `i + 2` plus `a[n-3]`.
- The variable `stop` is set to `True` if any element in `a` becomes less than 0 during the loop execution; otherwise, it remains `False`.
