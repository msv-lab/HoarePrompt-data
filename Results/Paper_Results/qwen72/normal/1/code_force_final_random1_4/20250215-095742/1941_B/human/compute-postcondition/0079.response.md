Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`numTest`**: Equal to `t`.
3. **`_`**: Set to 1.
4. **`n`**: An input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
5. **`a`**: A list of integers from the new input.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n - 3`.
7. **`opNum`**: Set to `a[n-3]`.
8. **`a[0]` through `a[n-3]`**: All are 0.
9. **`a[n-2]`**: Set to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
10. **`a[n-1]`**: Set to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
11. **`a[i]`**: Set to `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
12. **`a[i + 1]`**: Set to `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`.
13. **`a[i + 2]`**: Set to `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`.
14. **`stop`**: True if there exists at least one `a[i]` (where \(0 \leq i < n-2\)) that is less than 0. Additionally, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0.

### Analysis:
- **`a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0**: This means the first \(n-3\) elements of the list `a` are all zeros.
- **`a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]` are modified**: These elements are adjusted based on the value of `a[n-3]` (which is `opNum`).
- **`a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are modified**: These elements are adjusted based on the sum of `opNums` up to their respective indices.
- **`stop` condition**: If any of the elements from `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` are less than 0, or if the last two elements (`a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]`) are not zero, then `stop` is set to True.

Given the modifications and the `stop` condition, the code will print 'NO' if the `stop` condition is met. Since the `stop` condition is explicitly stated to be true under the given conditions, the print statement will always execute with 'NO'.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
