Let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `a` to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is equal to `t`.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `opNum` is `a[n-3]`.

### Transformations:
1. `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are set to 0.
2. `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
3. `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
4. `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
5. `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`.
6. `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`.
7. If `stop` is True, there exists at least one `a[i]` (where \(0 \leq i < n-2\)) that is less than 0.
8. `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0.
9. `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The list `a` is modified such that the last two elements (`a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]`) are set to 0.
- The elements from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` are set to 0.
- The elements `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` are adjusted based on the sum of `opNums` up to those indices.
- The condition `stop` being True means that at least one element in `a` (excluding the last two) is negative.

However, the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of these conditions or transformations. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
