Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `stop` is True, and at least one `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) is less than 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
