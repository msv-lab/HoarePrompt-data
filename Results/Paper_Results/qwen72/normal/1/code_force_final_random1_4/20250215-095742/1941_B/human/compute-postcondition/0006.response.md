Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The conditions for the list `b` are:
  - Either `b[0] % 2 == 0` (the first element is even) or `b[1] == b[0] + 2` (the second element is 2 more than the first).
  - Either `b[-1] % 2 == 0` (the last element is even) or `b[-2] == b[-1] + 2` (the second-to-last element is 2 more than the last).

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Explanation:
- The conditions provided for the list `b` ensure that certain properties are met, but they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or the contents of the list `b`.

Output: **YES**
