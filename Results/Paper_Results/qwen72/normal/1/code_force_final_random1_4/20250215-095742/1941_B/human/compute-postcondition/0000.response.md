The only variable in the loop head is the anonymous variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop is iterating a specific number of times based on the input value. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value corresponds to the number of test cases `t` described in the state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1, which aligns with the given condition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The input value for the loop is `t` and must be greater than 0.**
