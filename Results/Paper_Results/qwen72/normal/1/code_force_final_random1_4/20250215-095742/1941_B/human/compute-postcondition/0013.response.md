Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of integers based on the input provided. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition specified in the if part is true. Otherwise, the condition specified in the else part is true.***
