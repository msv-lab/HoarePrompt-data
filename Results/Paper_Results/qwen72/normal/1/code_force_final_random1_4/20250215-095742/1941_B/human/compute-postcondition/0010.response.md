The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `b`. This operation changes the value of `b` from being described as "a list of integers read from the input" to having a specific set of values based on the input provided. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input, and the conditions regarding the elements of `b` are as specified.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers based on the input provided.**
