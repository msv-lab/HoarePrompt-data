Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`, `stop` is False unless any `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) is less than 0, in which case `stop` is True and the loop terminates early.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`.
- In each iteration, the value of `opNum` is set to `a[i]`.
- The elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are updated based on the value of `opNum`.
- If any `a[i]` becomes less than 0 during the loop, the `stop` flag is set to True, and the loop breaks.
- After the loop completes, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` will be 0, and the last two elements `a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]` will be adjusted based on the operations performed in the loop.
- The final state of `a` will reflect the cumulative effect of all the operations performed in the loop.
