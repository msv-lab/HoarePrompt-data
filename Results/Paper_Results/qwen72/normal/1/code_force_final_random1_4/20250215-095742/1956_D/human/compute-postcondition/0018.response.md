The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called, which means the function will execute with the parameters `pos + 1` and `r`. This call does not immediately change the values of the variables in the current scope, but it initiates a recursive process that will affect the state of the program in subsequent calls.

However, since the function call itself does not modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the current scope, these variables retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. `pos` is not equal to `r`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:pos]`, and `s` is greater than or equal to `(pos - l) * (pos - l)`, and `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:pos]`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
