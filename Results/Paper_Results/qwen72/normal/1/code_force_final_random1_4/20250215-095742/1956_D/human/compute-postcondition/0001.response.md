The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and `a` is a list of integers read from input, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
