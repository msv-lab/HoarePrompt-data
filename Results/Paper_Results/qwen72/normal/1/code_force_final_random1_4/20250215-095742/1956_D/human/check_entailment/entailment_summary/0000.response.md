### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of integers and need to maximize the sum of its elements using a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is responsible for modifying the subarray `a[l:r+1]` and appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
     - It ensures that all elements in the subarray are set to the value `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`.
     - It handles the base case where `l == r` and sets `a[l]` to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function recursively processes the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length. If so, it applies the operation and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - It prints the results in the required format.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The functions work together to ensure that the array is modified to maximize the sum while adhering to the constraints.
   - The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the MEX operation is applied optimally.
   - The base cases and recursive calls are handled correctly to cover all possible scenarios.
   - The final output matches the problem requirements, including the format and the constraints on the number of operations.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the problem requirements, the program appears to be correct in its implementation and logic.

**Correctness: True**
