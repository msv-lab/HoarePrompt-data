### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function handles a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l + 1` to `r`.
     - If the element at `l` is not equal to the length of the subarray (`r - l + 1`), it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - **Issue:** The function assumes that the MEX value is always `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily true. The MEX value should be calculated based on the actual elements in the subarray.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - **Issue:** The function does not correctly calculate the MEX value for subarrays, leading to incorrect operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it calls `func_1` to process the subarray.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
     - **Issue:** The function does not correctly calculate the MEX value for subarrays, leading to incorrect operations.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
     - **Issue:** The function relies on the incorrect MEX calculation in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed because they do not correctly calculate the MEX value for subarrays.
   - The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not sufficient to ensure that the MEX value is correctly applied to subarrays.
   - The overall approach does not handle the problem constraints and requirements correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The functions do not handle edge cases such as single-element arrays or arrays where the initial sum is already maximized correctly.
   - The recursive approach does not ensure that the number of operations does not exceed the limit.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and recursive approach are flawed due to incorrect MEX value calculations, and the functions do not handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Final: **False**
