### Reasoning

Let's break down the original assessment and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Function Analysis

1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops)**:
   - This function is designed to modify the subarray `a[l:r+1]` by setting all elements to the MEX value of the subarray.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0 and sets it to 0 if true, adding the operation to `ops`.
   - For other cases, it recursively processes the subarray starting from `l + 1` to `r`.
   - If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and adds the operation to `ops`.

2. **func_2(a)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
   - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and adds the operation to `ops`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around the maximum value.

4. **func_3()**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - It prints the results in the required format.

#### Original Assessment

The original assessment points out two main issues:
1. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` in `recursive_maximize_sum` might not correctly identify when to apply the MEX operation.
2. The `func_1` function might not handle the base case and MEX calculation correctly.

### Evaluation

1. **Condition in `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is intended to check if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray. This is a heuristic to determine if the subarray can be improved by applying the MEX operation.
   - However, this condition is not always correct. For example, in the case where the subarray is already close to the maximum possible sum, this condition might still trigger unnecessary operations.

2. **Base Case and MEX Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The base case `if l == r` correctly handles single-element subarrays.
   - The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` ensures that the subarray is processed from the second element onwards.
   - The condition `if a[l] != r - l + 1:` correctly identifies when the MEX value should be applied to the subarray.

### Test Cases

Let's consider the test cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   2
   0 1
   ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     4 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies that the MEX of `[0, 1]` is 2 and sets both elements to 2, resulting in the correct output.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   3
   1 3 9
   ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies that no operations are needed since the sum is already maximized.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   1 100 2 1
   ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies the operations needed to maximize the sum.

4. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   0
   ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1 1
     1 1
     ```
   - The program correctly identifies that the MEX of `[0]` is 1 and sets the element to 1, resulting in the correct output.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is partially correct. The condition in `recursive_maximize_sum` can indeed lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases. However, the base case and MEX calculation in `func_1` are generally correct. Given the test cases and the overall structure of the program, the program is mostly correct but could benefit from a more robust condition in `recursive_maximize_sum`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is not entirely correct due to the potential suboptimal condition in `recursive_maximize_sum`. Further refinement of this condition is necessary to ensure the program always produces the optimal solution.
