### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 500,000 times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is responsible for setting a subarray `a[l:r+1]` to the MEX of the subarray if certain conditions are met. It appends the operation to the `ops` list and updates the subarray.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function recursively divides the array into subarrays and applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum. It uses the sum of the subarray and the maximum value in the subarray to decide whether to apply the MEX operation or split the subarray further.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1** correctly sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - **func_2** correctly initializes the process and returns the required values.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum** correctly divides the array and applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - **func_3** correctly reads the input and prints the results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle edge cases such as single-element arrays and arrays where no operations are needed.
   - The constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 18 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) are respected, and the number of operations does not exceed 500,000.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the MEX operation and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
