The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a tuple containing three elements: the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the length of the list `ops`, and the list `ops` itself. The list `ops` is initially empty and is populated during the execution of the function, but its exact contents depend on the internal operations of the `recursive_maximize_sum` function, which is not provided. After the function concludes, the sum of `a` is the total of all its elements, `len(ops)` is the number of elements in `ops`, and `ops` contains the operations performed (if any).
