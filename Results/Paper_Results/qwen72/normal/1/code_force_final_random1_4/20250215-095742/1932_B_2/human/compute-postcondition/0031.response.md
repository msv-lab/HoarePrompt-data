The only objects in the loop head are variables `ai` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, and `year` is `ai`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`, `year` is the second element in the list `a`**
