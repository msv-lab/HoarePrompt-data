You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a list containing two sublists: the first sublist contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of signs, and the second sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, each element being a list with two sublists: the first sublist contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The variable `results` is a list containing t elements, where each element is the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case. The variables `n`, `a`, `current_year`, and `ai` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` containing t elements, where each element represents the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case from the `test_cases` list. Each test case consists of a single integer n followed by a list of n integers. The length of `results` is equal to the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing periodicities. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `results` containing t elements, where each element represents the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case from the `test_cases` list. Each test case consists of a single integer n followed by a list of n integers. The length of `results` is equal to the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
