The code snippet `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to the value of `next_year`. Based on the initial state, `next_year` was previously calculated based on the conditions involving `current_year` and `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
- `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it
- `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1
- `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements
- `ai` is the third element of the list `a`
- `test` is the next element in `test_cases`
- If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is now equal to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` is now equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`

After executing the code snippet:
- `current_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`**.
