Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities, considering both direct travel and travel to the closest city. The program aims to precompute these costs to handle multiple queries efficiently.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of cities, their positions, and the queries. This part is handled well.

3. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative cost of traveling from the leftmost city to any city and from the rightmost city to any city, respectively.
   - However, there is a logical error in the initialization and calculation of `d1` and `d2`.

4. **Initialization and Calculation**:
   - `d1` is initialized with `d1[2] = 1`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `d1[1] = 0` because the cost to travel from the first city to itself is 0.
   - Similarly, `d2` is initialized with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `d2[n] = 0` because the cost to travel from the last city to itself is 0.
   - The logic for updating `d1` and `d2` is flawed. The program should update `d1` and `d2` based on the minimum cost to travel to the closest city, but the current logic does not correctly handle the cumulative cost.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the cumulative costs in `d1` and `d2`. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city and then update the cumulative cost accordingly.
   - The current logic does not correctly handle the cumulative cost when the distance to the next city is greater than the distance to the previous city.

6. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the direction of travel (left or right) and prints the difference in the cumulative costs stored in `d1` or `d2`.
   - However, due to the incorrect initialization and calculation of `d1` and `d2`, the results of the queries are likely to be incorrect.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the cities are at the boundaries (first and last city) due to the incorrect initialization and calculation of `d1` and `d2`.

8. **Efficiency**:
   - The program aims to efficiently calculate the cumulative costs in O(n) time for each test case and handle queries in O(1) time.
   - However, due to the logical errors, the efficiency is compromised, and the results are likely to be incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described due to the logical errors in the initialization and calculation of `d1` and `d2`.

Final: **False**
