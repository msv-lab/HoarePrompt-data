Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `1`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `2`
- `l` is a list of integers
- `m` must be greater than `0`
- `d1` is `0`
- `j` is `0`
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user
- `y` is greater than `x`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `d1`**: The initial state specifies that `d1` is `0`. In Python, `0` is an integer, not a list or dictionary. Therefore, `d1` cannot be indexed like a list or dictionary.
2. **Indexing `d1`**: The code attempts to access `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. Since `d1` is an integer (`0`), it cannot be indexed. This will result in a `TypeError` because integers do not support indexing.

### Conclusion:
The code will raise a `TypeError` because `d1` is an integer and cannot be indexed. Therefore, the print statement will not execute successfully.

Output: **TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable**
