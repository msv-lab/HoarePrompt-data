The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `l`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input.**
