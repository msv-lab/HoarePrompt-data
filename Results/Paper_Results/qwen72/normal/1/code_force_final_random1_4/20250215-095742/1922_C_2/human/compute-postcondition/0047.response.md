Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers read from input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
  - If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`.
  - If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1`**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive.
   - The values associated with these keys are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume they are initialized to some default value (typically 0 if not specified otherwise).

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - The relationship between `x` and `y` is given:
     - If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`.
     - If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` and no specific values are provided, we assume the default value for each key is 0.
- Therefore, `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` will both be 0 if `y` and `x` are within the range of 2 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will evaluate to `0 - 0 = 0`.

Output: **0**
