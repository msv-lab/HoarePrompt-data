You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `t`, which is the total number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the input integer representing the number of cities, `l` is the list of distances between cities, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, storing the minimum distance to the next city from the left, and `d2` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, storing the minimum distance to the next city from the right. `m` is the input integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, `x` and `y` are the indices of the cities provided by the user. The values of `d1` and `d2` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, and the results of the queries are printed accordingly.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost can either be the direct distance between the cities or 1 coin if traveling to the closest city.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of cities, their positions, and the queries. This part is handled well.

3. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative cost of traveling from the leftmost city to any city and from the rightmost city to any city, respectively.
   - For `d1`, it calculates the cost to travel from the leftmost city to each city using the closest city approach.
   - For `d2`, it calculates the cost to travel from the rightmost city to each city using the closest city approach.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the cities to fill `d1` and `d2` with the appropriate costs.
   - It correctly handles the condition where the cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.
   - If the distance to the next city is greater, it adds the actual distance to the cumulative cost.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the destination city is to the right or left of the starting city.
   - It then prints the difference in the cumulative costs stored in `d1` or `d2` depending on the direction of travel.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the cities are at the boundaries (first and last city).

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently calculates the cumulative costs in O(n) time for each test case.
   - Query handling is also efficient, taking O(1) time per query after the initial preprocessing.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
