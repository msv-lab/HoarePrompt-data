Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Additionally, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
