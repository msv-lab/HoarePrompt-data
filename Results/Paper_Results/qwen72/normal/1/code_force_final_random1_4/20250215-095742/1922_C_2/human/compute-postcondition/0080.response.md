The value of `d2[i]` is updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**
