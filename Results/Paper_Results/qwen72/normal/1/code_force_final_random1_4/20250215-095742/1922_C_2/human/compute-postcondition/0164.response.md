Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `j` is `m`.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1.
- If `y` > `x`, the state remains unchanged.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, the state also remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1`**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - For any other key, `d1[key]` will return 0 if the key is not explicitly set.

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
   - The conditions `y > x` and `y ≤ x` do not change the state, so we can assume `x` and `y` remain as provided.

3. **Expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`**:
   - If `y == 2`, then `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y != 2`, then `d1[y]` will be 0.
   - If `x == 2`, then `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x != 2`, then `d1[x]` will be 0.
   - Therefore, the possible values for `d1[y] - d1[x]` are:
     - If `y == 2` and `x == 2`, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`.
     - If `y == 2` and `x != 2`, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`.
     - If `y != 2` and `x == 2`, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`.
     - If `y != 2` and `x != 2`, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will depend on the values of `x` and `y` provided by the user. Specifically:

- If both `x` and `y` are 2, the output will be 0.
- If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, the output will be 1.
- If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, the output will be -1.
- If neither `x` nor `y` is 2, the output will be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is 1 if y == 2, otherwise 0, and d1[x] is 1 if x == 2, otherwise 0)**
