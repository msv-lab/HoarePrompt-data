To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers read from input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1`**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive.
   - Since `d1` is a defaultdict, if a key is accessed that is not explicitly set, it will return the default value, which is 0 unless otherwise specified.

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - `y` is greater than `x`.

3. **Expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`**:
   - Since `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, both `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` will return 0 if `y` and `x` are not explicitly set in `d1`.
   - If `y` and `x` are within the range of 2 to `n` and have been explicitly set, their values will be used.
   - If `y` and `x` are outside this range, they will default to 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the properties of defaultdicts, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will evaluate to 0 if `y` and `x` are not explicitly set in `d1` or if they are set to the same value. If they are set to different values, the result will be the difference between those values.

However, since the initial state does not specify any explicit values for `d1`, we assume the default behavior where `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are both 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
