The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `m` must be greater than 1, `d1` is 0, `j` is 1, and `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user. If `y` > `x`, the condition `y > x` holds true. If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.**
