The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameters defining the range, specifically `n - 2`, `0`, and the step `-1`. We need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, and `n` must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 (since the step is `-1`). Therefore, `i` will be `n - 4`.

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the range, which is `0`. Thus, `n - 4` must be greater than or equal to `0`, implying that `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
