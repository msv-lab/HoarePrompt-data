Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `d2[i]` is updated to the result of the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
