Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1. Regardless of whether `y` > `x` or `y` â‰¤ `x`, the state remains unchanged.***
