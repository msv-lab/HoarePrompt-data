Output State: **`s` must have at least 4 elements, `i` is `s[3]`, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[p]` before the swap, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `h` is the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `j` is 2, and all other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `ans1`, `p`, `z`) remain unchanged. If `h` is less than `i`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 0. If `h` is greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to 1.**
