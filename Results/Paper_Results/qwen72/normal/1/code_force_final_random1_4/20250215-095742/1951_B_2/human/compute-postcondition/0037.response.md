Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. Here, `k` is 14, `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `x` is `a[14]`. Since `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, the program calculates `14 - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, and returns the larger of these two values.**
