Postcondition: ***If `z` is 1, `i` is the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`), `ans1` is increased by 1, and the list `s` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue. If `z` is not 1, `i` remains the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`), and the list `s` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.***
