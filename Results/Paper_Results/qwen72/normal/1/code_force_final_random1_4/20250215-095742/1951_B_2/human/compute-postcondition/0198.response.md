Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the rating of your cow (at index `k`) when your cow is either at the beginning of the list or at a specific position determined by the initial ratings. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
