Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing `[i]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.** 

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `ind`, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
