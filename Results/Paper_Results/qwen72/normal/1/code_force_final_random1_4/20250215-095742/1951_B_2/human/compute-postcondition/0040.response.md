Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1. Here, `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of the element `x` in `a`. The first element of `ind` is 0, and `ind` has a length greater than 1.**
