Output State: **`s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[p]` before the swap, and all other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, `z`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code swaps the values of `s[0]` and `s[k - 1]`.
- Since `p` is equal to `j`, and `j` is the index of `i` in `s`, the value of `s[p]` is also updated to the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap.
- The value of `s[k - 1]` is updated to the value of `s[0]` before the swap.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, `z`) remain unchanged.
