#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of unique integers as input and returns an integer based on the following conditions: If no elements in `a` are greater than the element at index `k` (where `k` is a predefined index, typically 14), the function returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. If only one element in `a` is greater than the element at index `k`, the function returns either `k - 1` if the index of this element is 0, or the index of this element minus 1 if it is greater than `k`, or the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` otherwise. If two elements in `a` are greater than the element at index `k`, the function returns the minimum of the second element's index minus 1 and `k - 1` if the first element's index is 0, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `k` is greater than the second element's index, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` otherwise.
