Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but with the first element removed. `visited` set contains the integer `start` and all its unvisited neighbors, as well as all other nodes that have been processed. `current` is now equal to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) which represents the shortest path length from the starting node (`start`) to the current node being processed in the tree. The `queue` must not be empty.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but with the first element removed. `visited` set contains the integer `start` and all its unvisited neighbors, as well as all other nodes that have been processed. `current` is now equal to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. `queue` must not be empty. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set and a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to the `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but with the first element removed. `visited` set contains the integer `start`, all its unvisited neighbors, all other nodes that have been processed, and if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited` and a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is added to `queue`. `current` is now equal to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. `queue` must not be empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but with the first element removed. `visited` set contains the integer `start`, all its unvisited neighbors, all other nodes that have been processed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited` and a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is added to `queue`. `current` is now equal to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. `queue` must not be empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
