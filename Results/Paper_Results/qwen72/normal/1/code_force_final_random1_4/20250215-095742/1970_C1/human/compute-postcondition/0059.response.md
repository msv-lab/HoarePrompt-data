The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in a tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) which is the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. This distance represents the number of steps taken from the `start` node to reach the current node (`current`).
- **Case_3**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) which represents the shortest path length from the starting node (`start`) to the current node being processed in the tree. This distance is calculated as the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`.
- **Case_4**: The function returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found within the reachable nodes from the start node.

Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing node indices in a tree. It returns 0, the distance from the start node to the current node, the shortest path length from the start node to the target node, or -1 if the target node is not reachable from the start node.**
