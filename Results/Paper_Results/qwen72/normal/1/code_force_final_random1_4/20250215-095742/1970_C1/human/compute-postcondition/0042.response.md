The function `func` accepts parameters that define a tree structure and an initial node for a game. Specifically, it takes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, a list of `n-1` edges where each edge is a tuple `(u, v)` connecting two nodes (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and an integer `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the game. The tree has exactly two leaves.

The function returns the result of the game, which is determined by the structure of the tree and the starting node. However, the specific output is not detailed in the given information, so we can only describe the parameters and the general context of the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of `n-1` edges defining the connections between nodes, and an integer `u_1` representing the starting node for a game. The tree has exactly two leaves. The function returns the result of the game based on the tree structure and the starting node.**
