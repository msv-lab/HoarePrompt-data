The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.
- The tree has exactly two leaves.
- The initial node for the game is an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.

After executing the code snippet, the variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values read from the input. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are input integers.**
