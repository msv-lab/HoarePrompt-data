Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, but the lists within `lst` that were accessed and modified during the loop are now empty. `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is False if the total number of iterations is odd, or True if the total number of iterations is even, `two` is True.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, but the lists within `lst` that were accessed and modified during the loop are now empty, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs except the last element of `rev[z]`, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` before the pop operation, `one` is False if the total number of iterations is odd, or True if the total number of iterations is even, `two` is False, and `rev[z]` must contain at least one element less than before.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, but the lists within `lst` that were accessed and modified during the loop are now empty, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs except the last element of `rev[z]` and `rev[tmp]`, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` before the pop operation, `one` is False if the total number of iterations is odd, or True if the total number of iterations is even, `two` is True, and `rev[z]` and `rev[tmp]` must each contain at least one element less than before.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, but the lists within `lst` that were accessed and modified during the loop are now empty, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs except the last element of `rev[z]` and `rev[tmp]`, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` before the pop operation, `one` is False if the total number of iterations is odd, or True if the total number of iterations is even, `two` is False, `rev[z]` and `rev[tmp]` each contain at least one element less than before, and `tmp` is now the value that was popped from `rev[tmp]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
