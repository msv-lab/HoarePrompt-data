The variable in the loop head is `lst[tmp]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `lst[tmp] != []`. For the loop to execute again, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list but is now one element shorter. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, `lst[z]` is now one element shorter, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the second-to-last element that was removed from `lst[z]`, `one` is True, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list and contains at least one element**
