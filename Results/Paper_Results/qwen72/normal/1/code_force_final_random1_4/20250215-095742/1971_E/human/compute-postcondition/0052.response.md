Output State: **`ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to the new `ql`, the current iteration continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
