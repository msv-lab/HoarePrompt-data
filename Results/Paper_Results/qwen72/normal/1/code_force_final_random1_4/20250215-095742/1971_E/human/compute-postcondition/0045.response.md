Output State: **`ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `i` is set to 1. The other variables (`ql`, `m`, `l`, and `q`) remain as they were described in the initial state, with `ql` being updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` being incremented by 1, and `q` needing to be greater than the new value of `l`. The value of `m` remains 0.
