### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It initializes the lists `a` and `b` with the known positions and times, respectively, and prepends a 0 to both lists to handle the starting point (0, 0).

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The function calculates the differences in positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`) between consecutive known points.
   - This is done correctly using list comprehensions.

3. **Calculating Speeds:**
   - The function calculates the speeds (`v`) between consecutive known points by dividing the differences in positions by the differences in times.
   - This is also done correctly.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the function uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `ql` lies.
   - If the query point exactly matches a known position, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach the query point by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance in the current segment.
   - The result is printed after rounding down to the nearest integer.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the query point is exactly at a known position or when it lies between two known positions.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the correct segment is identified efficiently.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each query in the correct format, separated by spaces and followed by a newline for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all the specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
