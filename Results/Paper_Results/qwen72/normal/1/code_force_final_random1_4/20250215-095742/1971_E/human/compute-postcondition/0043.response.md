The only variable in the loop head is `l`, and the loop iterates over the range defined by `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must still be greater than the new value of `l`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`
- `m` is updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

State: **`ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`**
