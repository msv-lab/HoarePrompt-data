Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `q` remains an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` remains a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `ad` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `v` is a list containing the elements [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]].
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is updated to `m + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to the new `ql`, the current iteration continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `l` is `l + 1`, `q` must be greater than `l + 1`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
