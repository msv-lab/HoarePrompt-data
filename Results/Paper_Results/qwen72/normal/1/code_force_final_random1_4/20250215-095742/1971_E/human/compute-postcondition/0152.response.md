Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `a` has `len(a)` elements, `ad` contains the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `b` must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `bd` now contains the values `[previous bd values, b[len(a) - 1] - b[len(a) - 2], b[len(a)] - b[len(a) - 1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is `len(a)`, the new element appended to `bd` is `b[len(a)] - b[len(a) - 1]`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
