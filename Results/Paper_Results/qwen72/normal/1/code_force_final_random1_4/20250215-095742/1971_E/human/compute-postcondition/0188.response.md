To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `m` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is 1.
   - `q` is greater than 1.
   - `m` is computed as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s] == ql`, the condition holds true, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `b`, `bd`, `a`, and `ad` are lists whose specific values are not provided, but they are referenced in the computation of `m`.
   - `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.
   - `ql` is initially derived from `q` and is updated in each iteration.

3. **Computation of `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`
   - This formula combines elements from the lists `b`, `bd`, `a`, and `ad` with the current value of `ql`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for the lists `b`, `bd`, `a`, and `ad`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `m`. However, we can describe the output based on the provided formula and conditions.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the value of the expression `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`)**

This output indicates that the integer value of `m` will be printed, where `m` is calculated using the given formula involving the lists `b`, `bd`, `a`, and `ad`, and the current value of `ql`.
