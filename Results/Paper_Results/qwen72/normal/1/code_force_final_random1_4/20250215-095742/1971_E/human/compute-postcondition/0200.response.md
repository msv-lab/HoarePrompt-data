To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `l` is 2.
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `s` is the position in `a` such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

### Example Values:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]`.
- Suppose `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`.
- Suppose `bd = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Suppose `ad = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Suppose `q = 5` (greater than 2).

Given these values:
- `ql` starts as `q` which is 5.
- `s` is the index where 5 would fit in `a` to maintain sorted order. Since `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, `s` is 3 (index 2 in zero-based indexing).

Now, update `ql`:
- `ql = 5 - a[2] = 5 - 5 = 0`.

Calculate `m`:
- `m = b[2] + bd[3] * (0 - a[2]) / ad[3] = 30 + 4 * (0 - 5) / 4 = 30 + 4 * (-5) / 4 = 30 - 5 = 25`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`, which is 25, followed by a space.

Output: **25**
