The code snippet `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the index in the list `a` where the value `ql` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. This function returns the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains an input integer
- `k` remains an input integer
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements
- `b` remains a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements
- `ad` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`
- `bd` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`
- `i` is 1
- `v` is a list containing the elements [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]
- `l` is 0
- `m` is 0
- `ql` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet:
- `s` is assigned the index in the list `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Output State: **`t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` remains a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `ad` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing the elements [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]], `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index in the list `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain sorted order.**
