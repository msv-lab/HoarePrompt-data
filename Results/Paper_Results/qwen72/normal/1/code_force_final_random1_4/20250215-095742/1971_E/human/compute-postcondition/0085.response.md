Output State: **`b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` has two additional elements which are the differences between `b[2]` and `b[1]`, and `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`, `i` is 2.** 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `b[2]` and `b[1]` to the list `bd`. Since `i` is 2, `b[i]` is `b[2]` and `b[i-1]` is `b[1]`. Therefore, `bd` now contains two elements, both of which are the difference between `b[2]` and `b[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
