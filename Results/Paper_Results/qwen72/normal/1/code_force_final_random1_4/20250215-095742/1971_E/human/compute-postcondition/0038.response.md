Postcondition: ***All initial conditions remain unchanged. If `a[s] == ql`, the `continue` statement would normally cause the current iteration of a loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately, but since there is no loop context provided, the statement does not alter the state of the program. No new values are assigned to any variables in either case.***
