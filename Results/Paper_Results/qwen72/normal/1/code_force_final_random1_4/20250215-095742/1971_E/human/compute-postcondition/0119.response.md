Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `l`, and `_` remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `m` is now `b[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `ql` is now `int(input()) - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `b[s - 1]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `l`, `_`, `v`, `s`, `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
