Output State: **`ad` is a list starting with 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input, `ql` will be the last value of `ql - a[s - 1]` computed during the final iteration, `m` will be the last value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` computed during the final iteration, `l` will be equal to `q`, `i` will be 1, `s` will be the index where the final `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order, the lists `a`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ad = [0]` initializes the list `ad` to contain only the value 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
