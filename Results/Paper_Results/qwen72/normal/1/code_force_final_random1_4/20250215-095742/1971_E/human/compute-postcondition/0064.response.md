Output State: **`ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `l` is `l + 1`, `q` must be greater than `l + 1`, `i` is 1, and `s` is the index where the new `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.**
