### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which represent the known positions and times, respectively.
   - This part of the program is consistent with the problem description and handles input correctly.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with a leading zero to account for the starting point at 0.
   - It calculates the differences `ad` and `bd` between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It computes the speeds `v` for each segment by dividing the distance differences by the time differences.
   - This preprocessing step is necessary to determine the speed for each segment and is done correctly.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `d`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which `d` lies.
   - If `d` is exactly at a known position, it directly prints the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `d` by adding the time to the start of the segment and the additional time to reach `d` within the segment.
   - The time calculation is done by multiplying the remaining distance by the speed of the segment and adding it to the time already traveled.
   - The result is then rounded down by converting it to an integer before printing.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `d` is exactly at a known position by directly printing the corresponding time.
   - It also handles the case where `d` is between two known positions by correctly calculating the time based on the speed of the segment.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the segment in which `d` lies, making the solution scalable for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles input and output as specified, preprocesses the data efficiently, and accurately calculates the time for each query. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input according to the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
