The value of `m` is set to 0. The values of `ql`, `l`, and `q` remain unchanged. Since `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`, this condition still holds true.

Output State: **`ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.**
