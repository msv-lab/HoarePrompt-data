Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, all other variables (`b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `m`, `s`, and `_`) remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `l` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is now `0`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `ql` is now `int(input()) - a[s - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The `bisect_left(a, ql)` function finds the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. This index is assigned to `s`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `ql` is calculated as `int(input()) - a[s - 1]`, where `int(input())` is the user-provided integer input, and `a[s - 1]` is the element in `a` just before the position where `ql` would be inserted to maintain order.
- The updated value of `s` reflects the new index found by `bisect_left`.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid and unchanged.
