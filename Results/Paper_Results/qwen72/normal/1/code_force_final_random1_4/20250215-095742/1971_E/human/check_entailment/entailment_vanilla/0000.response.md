### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points, respectively.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with an extra 0 at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0).
   - It calculates the differences `ad` and `bd` which represent the distances and time intervals between consecutive known points.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` for each segment between known points.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the segment where the query point `ql` lies.
   - If the query point `ql` exactly matches a known point, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance in the current segment.

4. **Time Calculation:**
   - The time calculation is done by adding the time to reach the previous known point (`b[s-1]`) and the time to travel the remaining distance (`bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It efficiently finds the segment for each query and calculates the time using the precomputed differences and speeds. The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the segment search is efficient.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
