To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the updates to the variables:

### Initial State:
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`
- `m` is updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Update `ql`:**
   - The new value of `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - This means `ql` is reduced by the value of `a[s - 1]`.

2. **Update `m`:**
   - The new value of `m` is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - Here, `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` plus a term that depends on `bd[s]`, `ql - a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.
   - Since `m` is updated as described above, the value printed will be the new value of `m` after the update.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of `m` after it has been updated according to the formula provided in the initial state.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the updated value of m based on the formula m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
