Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `i` is 3, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[2] + x[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[3]` is updated to `a[2] + x[2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
