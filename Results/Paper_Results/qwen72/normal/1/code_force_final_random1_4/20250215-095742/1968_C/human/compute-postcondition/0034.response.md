The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, and `i` is managed by the loop starting from 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

However, since the loop starts from 1 and increments `i` by 1 each time, the correct adjustment for the next iteration would be:

- `i` should be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop increments it).
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `i` is 2, `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
