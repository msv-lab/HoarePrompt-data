The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.**
