Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `i` is `n-1`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variable `n` is still a positive integer, indicating the length of the list `a`.
- The list `x` remains unchanged and contains integers derived from user input.
- The list `a` is of length `n`, with the first element `a[0]` set to 1000.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- Each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`.
