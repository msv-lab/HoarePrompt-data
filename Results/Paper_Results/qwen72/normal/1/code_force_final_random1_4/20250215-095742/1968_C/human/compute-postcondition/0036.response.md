The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, `i` is 3, `a[2]` is now `a[1] + x[1]`**
