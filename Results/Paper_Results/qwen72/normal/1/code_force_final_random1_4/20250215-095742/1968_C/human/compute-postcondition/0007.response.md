The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2**
