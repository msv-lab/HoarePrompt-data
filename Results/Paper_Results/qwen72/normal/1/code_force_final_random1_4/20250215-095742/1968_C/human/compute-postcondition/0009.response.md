The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3**
