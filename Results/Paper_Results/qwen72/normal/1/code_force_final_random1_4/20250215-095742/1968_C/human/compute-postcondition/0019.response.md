Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000 and `a[1]` set to `1000 + x[0]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`.
- `a[0]` is 1000, and `x[0]` is the first element of the list `x` derived from user input.
- Therefore, `a[1]` is now `1000 + x[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
