You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i are four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input value. The loop prints the result of the expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Properties**: The program attempts to simplify the counts of each number by reducing them to even numbers (`int(x) - int(x) % 2`). This approach does not correctly account for the properties of the XOR operation. For example, the XOR of an even number of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s will result in 0, but the program does not correctly handle this.

2. **Flawed Logic for Maximum Wins**: The program uses a combination of checking the parity of the counts and summing them, which does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is not a valid check for determining the initial state of the XOR operation.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases where the counts of the numbers are such that the XOR of the sequence is zero or non-zero in a way that maximizes Bob's wins. For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`:
   - The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `1` because the initial XOR is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`, and removing any one of these numbers will make the XOR non-zero, resulting in Bob winning once.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 1 1 0`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (This is correct, but the logic is flawed and may fail in other cases.)

A more accurate approach would involve simulating the removal of numbers and calculating the XOR at each step to determine the optimal strategy for Eve. The current program does not do this and thus is incorrect.
