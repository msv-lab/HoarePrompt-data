Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the value of `cnt` to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had. The other variables (`t`, `p_i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this reset value for `cnt` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
