The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range determined by the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value.

Since the loop uses a dummy variable `_`, it does not directly modify any specific state variables other than the implicit counter that tracks the number of iterations. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the range must still have elements left to iterate over. This means the input value must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.

Given that the loop is iterating over a fixed range determined by the input, and assuming this is the first iteration (or the loop has just started), the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value, and the loop will execute one more time if the input value is greater than the number of iterations already completed.**

However, since the exact number of iterations completed is not explicitly tracked in the state, and the loop is designed to run a fixed number of times based on the input, the state at the start of the next iteration remains:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value.**
