Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is now `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `p_i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified.
- The variable `cnt` is updated in each iteration of the loop by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value, where `x` is the current element in the list `a`. After all iterations, `cnt` will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.
