The code snippet `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then applies the lambda function to each integer. The lambda function subtracts the remainder of the integer divided by 2 from the integer itself, effectively making each number even.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `p_i` are four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.
- `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

After executing the code:
- The variable `p` is updated to a list of four even integers derived from the input.
- The values of `p` will be the original `p_i` values rounded down to the nearest even number.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value.**
