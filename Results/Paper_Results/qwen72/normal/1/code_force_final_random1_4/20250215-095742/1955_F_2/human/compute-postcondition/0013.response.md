Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p_i` is a list of four integers where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is calculated as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - `math.floor(x / 2)` means taking each element `x` in the list `a`, dividing it by 2, and then taking the floor of the result (i.e., the largest integer less than or equal to the division result).

2. **Example Calculation**:
   - If `a = [4, 7, 10, 3]`:
     - `math.floor(4 / 2) = 2`
     - `math.floor(7 / 2) = 3`
     - `math.floor(10 / 2) = 5`
     - `math.floor(3 / 2) = 1`
   - Therefore, `cnt = 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11`.

3. **General Case**:
   - Without knowing the specific values in the list `a`, we can only describe `cnt` in terms of the formula used to compute it.
   - `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

### Final Output:
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for each element x in the list a)**
