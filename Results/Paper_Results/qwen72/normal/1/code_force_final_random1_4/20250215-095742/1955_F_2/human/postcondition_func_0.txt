The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads four integers representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It then processes these counts to ensure they are even numbers and calculates a specific value based on the counts. The function prints the result of this calculation for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
