Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `a`, `cnt` is now `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the floor division of `x` by 2 to its current value.
- `x` is the third element in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `p_i`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`.
