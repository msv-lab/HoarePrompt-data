Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`], `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` remains 1 if `x` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`, `j`], `i` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 2, 2, i] if `x` == 1, otherwise `p` is a list containing elements [0, 0, 0, i], `c` is a list containing elements [0, 3, 3, j] if `x` == 1, otherwise `c` is a list containing elements [0, 1, 1, j].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
