The code `c.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element.
- `x` is the first element of `l`.
- `i` is equal to `x`.
- If `x` is 1, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.
- `p` now contains the value of `x` as its first element.

The value of `j` depends on whether `x` is 1 or not. If `x` is 1, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` is 0. The list `c` is updated by appending `j`.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `l`, `i` is equal to `x`, if `x` is 1, `j` is 1 and `c` is [1]; otherwise, `j` is 0 and `c` is [0], `p` now contains the value of `x` as its first element.**
