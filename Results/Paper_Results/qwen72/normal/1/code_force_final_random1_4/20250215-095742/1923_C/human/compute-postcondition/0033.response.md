Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 0.
2. `m` is greater than 0.
3. `a` and `b` are input integers.
4. `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
5. `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
6. The difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1, which means `b - a + 1 > 1`.
7. The value of `s` minus this difference is greater than or equal to `i`, which means `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The conditions provided ensure that certain relationships hold true between the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `p`.
- Specifically, the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` must be satisfied for the `print` statement to execute.
- Since the conditions are met, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
