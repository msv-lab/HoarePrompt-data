Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `m` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
4. `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
5. `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
6. The difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1.
7. The value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation of the Conditions:
- The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` implies that the range from `a` to `b` (inclusive) contains more than one element.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the value of `s` adjusted by the length of the range from `a` to `b` is at least as large as `i`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these conditions directly, it will always print `'YES'` regardless of the specific values of `a`, `b`, `i`, or `s` as long as the conditions are met.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
