Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `m`, `_`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- The conditions involving `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain the same as they depend on the new values of `a` and `b`.
