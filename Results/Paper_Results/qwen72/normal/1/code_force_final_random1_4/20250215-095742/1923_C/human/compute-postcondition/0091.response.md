To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
   - `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition holds true.
   - Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('YES')`.

Given the condition, if the condition is true, the code will print 'YES'. If the condition is false, the code does not specify what should be printed, so we assume it will only print 'YES' if the condition is met.

Let's analyze the condition step by step:

- **First Part of the Condition:**
  - `b - a + 1 > 1` simplifies to `b - a > 0` or `b > a - 1`.
  - This means that `b` must be greater than `a - 1`.

- **Second Part of the Condition:**
  - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` simplifies to `s - b + a - 1 >= i`.
  - This means that the difference between `s` and the length of the range from `a` to `b` must be greater than or equal to `i`.

If both parts of the condition are satisfied, the code will print 'YES'. If either part is not satisfied, the code will not print anything (or it will not execute the print statement).

Since the condition is not explicitly stated to be false, and the print statement is inside the condition block, we can conclude that if the condition is met, 'YES' will be printed.

Output: **YES (if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true)**
