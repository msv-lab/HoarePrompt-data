Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `l` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `n` and `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
   - `s` is now equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the following print statement:
     ```python
     print('NO')
     ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - None of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state are used in this print statement.
   - Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
