Postcondition: ***`l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum at index `a-1` in `p`. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is greater than 1 and the difference between `s` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, either the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is less than or equal to 1, or the difference between `s` and the length of the subarray is less than `i`.***
