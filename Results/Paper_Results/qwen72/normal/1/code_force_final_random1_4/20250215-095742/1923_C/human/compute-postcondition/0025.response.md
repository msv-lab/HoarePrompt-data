The code snippet `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The value of `i` was previously increased by the value of `x`, which is the third element in the list `l`. Depending on the value of `x`, the lists `p` and `c` are initialized differently.

- If `x` is 1, `p` is initially `[0, 2, 2]` and `c` is `[0, 3, 3]`.
- If `x` is not 1, `p` is initially `[0, 0, 0]` and `c` is `[0, 1, 1]`.

After appending `i` to `p`, the new value of `p` will include the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, if `x` == 1, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 2, 2, i] and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 3, 3]. Otherwise, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 0, 0, i] and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 1, 1].**
