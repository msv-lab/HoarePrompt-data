Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`], `i` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `l`, and `p` now contains [0, `i`, `i`].**

Explanation:
- The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`.
- Since `i` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, the list `p` will now contain [0, `i`, `i`].
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
