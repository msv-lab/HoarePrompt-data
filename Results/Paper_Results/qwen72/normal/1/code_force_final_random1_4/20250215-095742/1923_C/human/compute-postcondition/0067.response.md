Postcondition: ***`_` is `m`, `m` is the second integer input, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1] + x`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. The values of `t`, `n` (the first integer input), `p` is updated to include the new element `i`, `c` is updated to include the new element `j`, `i` remains unchanged. `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `l`. If `x` is equal to 1, `j` is set to 2. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
