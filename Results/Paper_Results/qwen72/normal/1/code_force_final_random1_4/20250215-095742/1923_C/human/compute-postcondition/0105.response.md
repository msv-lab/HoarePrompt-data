The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `_` is `m` (which was initially 0)
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `l` is updated to contain a list of integers from the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `_` is `m` (which was initially 0), `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`. `l` is a list of integers from user input.**
