To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `n` and `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
   - `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement.

Given the condition:
- The condition checks if the length of the subarray from `a` to `b` is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`) and if the difference between the cumulative sum of the subarray and the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to `i` (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

Since the condition is not explicitly stated to be true, and the only action taken is to print 'NO', it implies that the condition is not met.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
