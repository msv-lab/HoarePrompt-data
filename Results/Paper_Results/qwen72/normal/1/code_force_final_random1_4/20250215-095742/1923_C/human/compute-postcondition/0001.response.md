The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `n` and `m` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value for the loop is `t` which must be greater than 0.

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
