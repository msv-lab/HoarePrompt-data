Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variables `i` and `j`, which are both set to 0.
