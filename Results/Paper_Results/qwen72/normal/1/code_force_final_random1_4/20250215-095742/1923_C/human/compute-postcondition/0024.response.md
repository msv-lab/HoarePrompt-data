The value of `i` is increased by the value of `x`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The list `p` is then appended with the new value of `i`.

- If `x` == 1, `p` was initially [0, 2, 2], and `c` was [0, 3, 3].
- Otherwise, `p` was initially [0, 0, 0], and `c` was [0, 1, 1].

After appending `i` to `p`, the new value of `p` will be the original list followed by the updated value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 2, 2, i] if `x` == 1, otherwise `p` is a list containing elements [0, 0, 0, i], and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 3, 3] if `x` == 1, otherwise `c` is a list containing elements [0, 1, 1].**
