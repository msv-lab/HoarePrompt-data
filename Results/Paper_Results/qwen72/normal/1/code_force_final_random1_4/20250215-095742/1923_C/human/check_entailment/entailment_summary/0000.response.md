Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `c`, and the number of queries `q`. It also reads the array `c` and the queries.

2. **Cumulative Sums and Counts**:
   - The program maintains two cumulative lists:
     - `p`: Cumulative sum of the elements in `c`.
     - `c`: Cumulative count of the number of 1s in `c`.
   - These lists are used to efficiently compute the sum and count of 1s for any subarray defined by the queries.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` using the cumulative sum list `p`.
   - It also calculates the count of 1s in the subarray using the cumulative count list `c`.
   - The program then checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying the condition:
     - The subarray is good if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`) and the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is at least the count of 1s in the subarray (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem requirements. The use of cumulative sums and counts allows for efficient query processing, which is crucial given the constraints.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
