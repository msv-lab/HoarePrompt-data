The only variable in the loop head is the anonymous variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range defined by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value passed to `range` must be greater than 0. This value is determined by the input, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases (`t`). Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure it is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9
- `queries` is a list of q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n

We need to ensure that the input value (which should be `t`) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value for the loop is `t` which must be greater than 0**
