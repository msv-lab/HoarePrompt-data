Output State: **`l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum at index `a-1` in `p`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a` and `b` based on user input.
- All other variables (`l`, `i`, `p`, `j`, `c`, `n`, `m`, `_`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `a` and `b` are now integers provided by the user.
