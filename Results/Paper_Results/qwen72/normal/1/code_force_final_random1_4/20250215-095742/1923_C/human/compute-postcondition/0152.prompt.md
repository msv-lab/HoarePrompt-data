Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `l` remains a list of integers from user input. `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`. `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`. `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`. `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum at index `a-1` in `p`. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is greater than 1 and the difference between `s` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, either the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is less than or equal to 1, or the difference between `s` and the length of the subarray is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is now equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
