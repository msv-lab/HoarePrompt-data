Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is equal to the sum of the first and second elements of `l`, `p` now contains the value of the first element of `l` as its first element and `i` as its second element. If `x` is 1, `j` is 2 and `c` is [1, 2]; otherwise, `j` is 1 and `c` is [0, 1] if the first element of `l` is 1; otherwise, `j` is 0 and `c` is [0, 0].**
