To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `m` is greater than 2.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement.

Given the condition, if the condition is not met, the code will print 'NO'. Let's analyze the condition in detail:

- **First Part of the Condition:**
  - `b - a + 1 > 1` simplifies to `b - a > 0` or `b > a - 1`.
  - This means that `b` must be greater than `a - 1`.

- **Second Part of the Condition:**
  - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` simplifies to `s - (b - a + 1) >= c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
  - This means that the difference between `s` and the length of the range `(b - a + 1)` must be greater than or equal to the difference between `c[b]` and `c[a - 1]`.

If either of these conditions is not met, the code will print 'NO'.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `p`, we cannot definitively determine the exact values of `i` and `s`. However, based on the given condition, if the condition is not met, the output will be 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
