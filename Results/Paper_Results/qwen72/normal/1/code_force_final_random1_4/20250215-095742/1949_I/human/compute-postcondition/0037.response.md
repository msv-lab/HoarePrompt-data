Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers (potentially updated), `visited[2]` is `True` if it was `False` initially, `coef[1]` is set to 1 if `visited[2]` was `False` in the previous iteration, `coef[2]` is set to 1 if `visited[2]` was `False` initially, `tot` might be updated (could be 0 or a non-zero value), `bipartite` might be updated (could be `True` or `False`), and `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, or if `ok` was already `True` before the update.***
