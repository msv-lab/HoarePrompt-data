Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `coef` to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited`) remain in their initial states.
