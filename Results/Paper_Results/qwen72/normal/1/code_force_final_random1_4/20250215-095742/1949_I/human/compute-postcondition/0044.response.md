The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems to operate on predefined variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` within its scope. The variable `n` is an integer with a constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, representing the number of elements in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. Each of `x` and `y` is a list of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and `r` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. The list `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of None values, both of length `n`.

Given the lack of explicit return statements in the provided snippet, it's not clear what the function returns. However, based on the typical behavior of functions dealing with such parameters, it might modify the `visited` or `coef` lists or perform some operation related to the coordinates and radii defined by `x`, `y`, and `r`.

Functionality: **The function operates on predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`, where `x` and `y` contain coordinates, `r` contains radii, and `visited` and `coef` are auxiliary lists. The exact return value or modification of these lists is not specified in the provided information.**
