n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i] and y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element. coef is a list of None values with length n.
