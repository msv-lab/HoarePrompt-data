Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers (potentially updated). If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` are `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `tot` is potentially incremented or modified, `bipartite` is potentially set to `False`, and `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not 0 or if `bipartite` is `True`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.***
