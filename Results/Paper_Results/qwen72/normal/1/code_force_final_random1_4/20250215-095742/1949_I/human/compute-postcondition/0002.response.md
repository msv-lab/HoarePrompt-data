Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), -10^9 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9, `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
