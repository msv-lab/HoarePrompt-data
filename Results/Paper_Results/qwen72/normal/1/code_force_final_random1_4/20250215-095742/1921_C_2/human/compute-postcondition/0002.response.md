The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, storing these integers in the list `feat`.

- `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- `test_cases` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input.**
