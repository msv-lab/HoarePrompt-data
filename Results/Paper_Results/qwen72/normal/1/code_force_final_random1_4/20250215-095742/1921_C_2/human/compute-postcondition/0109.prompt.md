Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers derived from the user input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to `a`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the user input, and `array2` is a list containing elements that were appended during the loop execution based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` was appended to `array2`. For each subsequent index `i` (where `i > 0`), if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` was appended to `array2`. If none of these conditions were met for any `i`, `array2` remains unchanged or remains as it was after the last successful append. After the if-else block, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `i` will have reached the value `n`, indicating the loop has completed its execution. The variable `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` will include the value `arr[0] * a`. For subsequent indices, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` will include the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`) will remain unchanged. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then this condition holds true. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`, `array2` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, `array2` contains `arr[0] * a`. For subsequent iterations, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` contains `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `feat`, `arr`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
