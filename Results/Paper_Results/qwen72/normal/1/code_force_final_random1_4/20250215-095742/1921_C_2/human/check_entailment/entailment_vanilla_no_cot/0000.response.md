Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as specified:

1. **Charge Calculation for Continuous Operation**: The program attempts to calculate the total charge required for continuous operation between messages, but it does this incorrectly. It only considers the charge needed for the gaps between messages that are less than `b / a`. However, the correct approach should consider the total charge required for all operations, including the cost of turning the phone off and on again if it's more efficient.

2. **Charge Calculation for Turning Off and On**: The program calculates the total charge required for turning the phone off and on again for some messages, but it doesn't correctly account for the charge used during the actual message sending times. It should consider the total charge used for both the time the phone is on and the cost of turning it off and on.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Output**: The condition `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:` is not correct. It should instead check if the total charge required (considering both the time the phone is on and the cost of turning it off and on) is less than or equal to the initial charge `f`.

A corrected version of the program would need to properly account for the total charge used for both the time the phone is on and the cost of turning it off and on, and then compare this total with the initial charge `f`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial charge required for the first message
        charge_needed = arr[0] * a
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Charge needed to keep the phone on from the previous message to the current one
            charge_needed += min((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a, b)
        
        # Check if the total charge needed is within the initial charge
        if charge_needed <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the total charge required is calculated correctly and compared against the initial charge `f` to determine if Stepan can send all the messages.
