The code snippet `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` is a list of integers from the input
- `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`
- `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`
- `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`
- `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`

After executing the code snippet, the list `arr` is populated with the integers from the input. The other variables (`i`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
