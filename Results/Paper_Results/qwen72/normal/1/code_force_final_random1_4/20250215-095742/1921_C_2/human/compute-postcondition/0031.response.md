The provided Python code snippet reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to the list `arr`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `feat[0]`
- `n` is `feat[0]`
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` is a list of integers from the new input
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat`
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Impact:
- The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to the list `arr`.

### Updated Variables:
- `arr` is now a list of integers read from the input.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `i` remains `feat[0]`
- `n` remains `feat[0]`
- `test_cases` remains an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` remains a list of integers from the new input
- `f` remains `feat[1]`
- `a` remains the third element of the new `feat`
- `b` remains the last element of the new `feat`
- `array2` remains a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Output State:
**`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
