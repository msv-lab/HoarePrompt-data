Based on the initial state and the provided conditions:

- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the list `arr`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, indicating that `n` has not decreased.
- `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` is a list of integers from the input.
- `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`.
- `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`.
- `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met.
- The sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
