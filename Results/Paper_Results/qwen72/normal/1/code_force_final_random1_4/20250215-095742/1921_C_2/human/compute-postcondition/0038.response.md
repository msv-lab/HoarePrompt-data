Output State: **`array2` now contains one more element, which is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` to `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `array2` increases by 1, and its new last element is the calculated value.
