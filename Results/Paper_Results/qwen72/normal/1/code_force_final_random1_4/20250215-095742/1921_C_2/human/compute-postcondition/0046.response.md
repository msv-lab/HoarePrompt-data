Postcondition: **`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the value of `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
