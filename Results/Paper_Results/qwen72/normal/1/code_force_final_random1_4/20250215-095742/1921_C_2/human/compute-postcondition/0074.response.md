The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes four integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of integers `m` (where `m` is a list of moments). Here, `n` represents the number of messages, `f` is the initial phone charge, `a` is the charge loss per unit time, and `b` is the charge loss for turning the phone off and on. The list `m` contains the moments at which messages need to be sent, and each moment `m_i` is an integer where `1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9` and `m_i < m_{i+1}`.

The function processes each test case and calculates the minimum total charge loss required to send all messages, considering the options of either keeping the phone on or turning it off and on between messages.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages `n`, initial phone charge `f`, charge loss per unit time `a`, charge loss for turning the phone off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m` when messages need to be sent. It returns the minimum total charge loss required to send all messages for each test case.**
