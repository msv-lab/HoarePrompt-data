The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `test_cases`. This means `test_cases` will hold an integer value that is read from the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and since `test_cases` is now assigned the value of `t`, `test_cases` will also be within this range.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, as no other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge loss per unit time, and charge loss for turning the phone off and on, respectively. `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` are integers where 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
