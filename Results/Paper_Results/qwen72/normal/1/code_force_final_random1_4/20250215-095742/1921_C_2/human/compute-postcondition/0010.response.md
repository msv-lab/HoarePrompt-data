Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `array2` is an empty list. The difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.**
