Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption rates, and message sending times. For each test case, it calculates whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge required for sending messages (considering both continuous and intermittent usage) is less than or equal to the initial charge, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
