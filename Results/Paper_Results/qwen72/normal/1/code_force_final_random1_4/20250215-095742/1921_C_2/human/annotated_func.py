#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n, f, a, b are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge loss per unit time, and charge loss for turning the phone off and on, respectively. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the final input, `n` is the value of `feat[0]` from the final input, `f` is the value of `feat[1]` from the final input, `a` is the value of `feat[2]` from the final input, `b` is the value of `feat[-1]` from the final input, `arr` is a list of integers from the final input, and `array2` contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of messages `n`, initial phone charge `f`, charge loss per unit time `a`, charge loss for turning the phone off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m` when messages need to be sent. For each test case, it calculates whether the total charge loss required to send all messages (considering both the charge loss per unit time and the charge loss for turning the phone off and on) is less than the initial phone charge `f`. If the total charge loss is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
