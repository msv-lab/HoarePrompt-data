The code snippet `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, and converts each string to an integer, storing the result in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is `feat[0]`.
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.

After executing the code snippet, the list `arr` is updated to contain the integers read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n`. `n` is `feat[0]`. `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. `feat` is a list of integers from the new input. `f` is `feat[1]`. `a` is `feat[2]`. `b` is `feat[-1]`. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
