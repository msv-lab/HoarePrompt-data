Output State: **`array2` is an empty list, `i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `array2` as an empty list.
- No other variables are modified by this code snippet.
- The initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.
