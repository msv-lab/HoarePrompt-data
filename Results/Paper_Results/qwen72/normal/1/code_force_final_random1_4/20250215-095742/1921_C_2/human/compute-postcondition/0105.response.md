To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n-1`.
2. `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`.
3. `array2` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions specified in the loop.
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, `array2` contains `arr[0] * a`.
     - For subsequent iterations, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` contains `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
4. All other variables (`test_cases`, `feat`, `arr`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged.
5. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

### Analysis:
- The condition `if i == 0 and arr[0] < b / a` determines whether the first element of `array2` is added.
- Subsequent elements are added based on the condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
- The final condition checks if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Yes')` statement will execute if the final condition is met. Given that the initial state specifies that this condition is true, the `print` statement will indeed print 'Yes'.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
