The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `l` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and must be greater than 3, `k` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 4], `i` is 3**
