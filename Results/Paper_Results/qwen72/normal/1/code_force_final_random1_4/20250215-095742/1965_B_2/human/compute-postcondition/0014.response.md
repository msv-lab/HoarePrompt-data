Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from 2^2 up to 2^(l-1), `i` is l.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain the initial elements [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 starting from 2^2 (which is 4) up to 2^(l-1). The variable `i` will be equal to `l`, which is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
