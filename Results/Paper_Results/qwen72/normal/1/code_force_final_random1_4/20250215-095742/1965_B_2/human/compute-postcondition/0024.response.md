Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4], `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`.
- Given that `i` is 2, `2 ** i` evaluates to `4`.
- Therefore, `ans` changes from `[1, 2]` to `[1, 2, 4]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
