The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it implicitly depends on two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function has two possible outputs:

- **Case_1:** The function returns the string '1\n2'.
- **Case_2:** The function returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. The contents of `ans` depend on the values of `n` and `k`:
  - If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` is a list starting with [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\).
  - If `k` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(k - 2^{(lk-1)}\), \(k + 1\), \(2 * k + 1\), \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(2^{(lk-1)}\), ..., \(2^{(l-1)}\)], where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, and `lk` must be less than `l`.

Functionality: **The function `func_14` implicitly depends on two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It returns either the string '1\n2' or a space-separated string of elements in a list `ans`. The list `ans` is constructed based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` starts with [2, 3] followed by powers of 2; if `k` is not 1, `ans` contains a specific sequence involving `k` and powers of 2.**
