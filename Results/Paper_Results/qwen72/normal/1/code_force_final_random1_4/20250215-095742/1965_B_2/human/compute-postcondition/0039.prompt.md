You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

If `k` is equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\), and `i` is `l`.

If `k` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(k - 2^{(lk-1)}\), \(k + 1\), \(2 * k + 1\), \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(2^{(lk-1)}\), ..., \(2^{(l-1)}\)], where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, and `lk` must be less than `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_14` implicitly depends on two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It returns either the string '1\n2' or a space-separated string of elements in a list `ans`. The list `ans` is constructed based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` starts with [2, 3] followed by powers of 2; if `k` is not 1, `ans` contains a specific sequence involving `k` and powers of 2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'.

Case_2: The program returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. The contents of `ans` depend on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` is a list starting with [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\). If `k` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(k - 2^{(lk-1)}\), \(k + 1\), \(2 * k + 1\), \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(2^{(lk-1)}\), ..., \(2^{(l-1)}\)], where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, and `lk` must be less than `l`.
