To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses the `range` function with the result of `func_10()` as its argument.
   - The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(func_10())` returns a non-empty sequence.
   - `range(n)` returns a sequence from 0 to n-1, which is non-empty if `n > 0`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since no variables are passed to `func_16`, the only thing we can adjust is the return value of `func_10()`.
   - For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer (greater than 0).

### Final State Adjustment:
- The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
