### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses functions like `func_10()` and `func_7()` to read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `m` respectively. These functions are correctly implemented to read from standard input and convert the input to the appropriate data types.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15()`. The goal is to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` and calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This formula is derived from the problem constraints and is used to count the valid pairs efficiently.
   - The loop continues until `i * i > n + i`, ensuring that all possible values of `i` are considered.

3. **Output**:
   - The result of `func_15()` is printed for each test case using `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` inside a loop that runs `func_10()` times. This ensures that the output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` and `m` are small (e.g., `1 1`) and when they are large (e.g., `1000000 1145141`). The logic in `func_15()` is designed to handle these cases efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads input, processes the data, and produces the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
