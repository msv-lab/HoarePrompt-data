The function `func_12` takes a dictionary `d` mapping integers to lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers initialized to 0, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers also initialized to 0. The function returns either 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, or the value of `tmp + 1` otherwise, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed yet. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to the returned value. The `processing` list is used to track which elements have been processed during the recursive calls, but it is reset to its initial state before the function returns.
