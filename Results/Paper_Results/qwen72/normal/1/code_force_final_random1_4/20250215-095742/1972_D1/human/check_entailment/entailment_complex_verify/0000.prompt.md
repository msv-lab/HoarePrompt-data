You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and returns this integer. It does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program has read one line from stdin and converted it to an integer, which is then returned.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed to the function. This function reads input from stdin and returns a map object containing integers.
def func_2():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits the line into parts, converts each part into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object of integers, derived from the input line, is available for further processing.

#Function 3:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain a space-separated list of integers. It then converts these values into integers and returns them as a list. The function does not modify any external variables or state; it only processes the input and returns the resulting list of integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows_number is a non-negative integer.
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times, where `rows_number` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature. This function reads a line from standard input and returns it after stripping the trailing whitespace. It does not take any parameters.
def func_5():

    #The program returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The value of each element depends on the implementation of `func_7()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The value of each element depends on the implementation of `func_7()`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a new list with the specified number of elements, each generated by `func_7()`.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are present in the function signature. The function `func_9` does not take any parameters and simply returns the result of the `input()` function, which reads a line of input from the user.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function `func_11`. This function is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be a string that can be split into multiple parts.
def func_11():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the standard input, splits this string into multiple parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and returns a list of these parts. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input string has been processed and a list of its split components is available as the return value.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, da is an integer key present in d, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the maximum value in d's keys, initialized to 0, rank is a list of integers of the same length as processing, initialized to 0.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `d` remains a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `da` is still an integer key present in `d`. The list `d[da]` has been fully processed. For each `di` in `d[da]`, if `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, it has been temporarily set to 1 during the iteration, and `tmp` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. After each iteration, `processing[di - 1]` is reset to 0. The final value of `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from all calls to `func_12` for which `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The `rank` list remains unchanged throughout the loop.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from all calls to `func_12` for which `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is updated to this returned value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes a dictionary `d` mapping integers to lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers initialized to 0, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers also initialized to 0. The function returns either 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, or the value of `tmp + 1` otherwise, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed yet. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to the returned value. The `processing` list is used to track which elements have been processed during the recursive calls, but it is reset to its initial state before the function returns.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns (1, 0, a) where 'a' is an integer.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)` where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values returned by the function `func_13(b, a % b)`. Here, `y` is one of the values returned by `func_13`, `x - (a // b) * y` is calculated using the integer division of `a` by `b` and the value of `y`, and `g` is another value returned by `func_13`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) as input and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and uses the results to compute and return a new tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The final state of the program includes the returned tuple, which represents the extended Euclidean algorithm results for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer representing the length of the list a, m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than `m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the conditions described and returns either 1 or -1 depending on the final value of `k`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, updated by `func_7()`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\), `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\) where \(i\) is the smallest integer such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\), and \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\). Here, \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\), and `n` is a positive integer updated by the function `func_7`. The function effectively computes a specific mathematical sum based on the updated value of `n` and returns the result decremented by 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_16`.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The return value of `func_15()` is printed to the standard output for each iteration of the loop, and no variables are modified. The condition that `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prints the result of calling `func_15()` to the standard output, once for each iteration of a loop that runs `func_10()` times. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative integer, nothing is printed. The function does not modify any external variables.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_15` appears to be attempting to solve a different problem, and it does not match the problem description at all. It calculates a value based on a loop that increments `i` and checks a condition involving `n` and `i`, but this logic is unrelated to the problem of finding pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

A correct implementation would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). The current implementation does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect.
