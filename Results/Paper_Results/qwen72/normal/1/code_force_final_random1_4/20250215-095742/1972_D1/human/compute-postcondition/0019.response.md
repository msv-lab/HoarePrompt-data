Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` is a list of integers with a length greater than 2, `di` is the third element in `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, `processing[di - 1]` is not 0, and `tmp` remains unchanged.***
