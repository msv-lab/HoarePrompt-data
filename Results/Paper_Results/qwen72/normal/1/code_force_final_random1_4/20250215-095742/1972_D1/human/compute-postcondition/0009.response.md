The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially 2, after incrementing by 1, `i` becomes 3.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, updated by `func_7()`, `i` is 3, `ans` is `(n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)`**
