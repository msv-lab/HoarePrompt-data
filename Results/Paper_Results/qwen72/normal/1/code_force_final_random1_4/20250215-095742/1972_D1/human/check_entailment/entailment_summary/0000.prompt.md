Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and returns this integer. It does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program has read one line from stdin and converted it to an integer, which is then returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits the line into parts, converts each part into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object of integers, derived from the input line, is available for further processing.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain a space-separated list of integers. It then converts these values into integers and returns them as a list. The function does not modify any external variables or state; it only processes the input and returns the resulting list of integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace (including spaces and newline characters), and returns the resulting string. After the function concludes, the program has read one line from standard input and the returned string contains the content of that line without trailing whitespace.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads the next line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the result as a string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the returned list contains the integers parsed from the input string.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The value of each element depends on the implementation of `func_7()`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a new list with the specified number of elements, each generated by `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. After the function concludes, the program has a string containing the user's input.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user input and returns this integer. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value entered by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the standard input, splits this string into multiple parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and returns a list of these parts. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input string has been processed and a list of its split components is available as the return value.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes a dictionary `d` mapping integers to lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers initialized to 0, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers also initialized to 0. The function returns either 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, or the value of `tmp + 1` otherwise, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from recursive calls to `func_12` for elements in `d[da]` that have not been processed yet. Additionally, the function updates `rank[da - 1]` to the returned value. The `processing` list is used to track which elements have been processed during the recursive calls, but it is reset to its initial state before the function returns.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) as input and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and uses the results to compute and return a new tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The final state of the program includes the returned tuple, which represents the extended Euclidean algorithm results for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the conditions described and returns either 1 or -1 depending on the final value of `k`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\). Here, \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\), and `n` is a positive integer updated by the function `func_7`. The function effectively computes a specific mathematical sum based on the updated value of `n` and returns the result decremented by 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prints the result of calling `func_15()` to the standard output, once for each iteration of a loop that runs `func_10()` times. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative integer, nothing is printed. The function does not modify any external variables.
