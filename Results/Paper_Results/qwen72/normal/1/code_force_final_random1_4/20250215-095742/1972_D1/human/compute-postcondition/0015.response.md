The function `func_15` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function calculates the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\). Here, \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
