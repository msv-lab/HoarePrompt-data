The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_7()`. The value of each element depends on the implementation of `func_7()`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a new list with the specified number of elements, each generated by `func_7()`.
