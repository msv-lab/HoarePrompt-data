Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the letters corresponding to the counts of each element in `rev_array` starting from index `j` (which ranges from 0 to `l-1`) in the `alp` list, `j` is `l`, `l` is an input integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`i`**: Remains 2.
- **`array`**: Remains the list of integers provided by the user input.
- **`alp`**: Remains the list of lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- **`rev_array`**: Remains the reversed version of `array`.
- **`ans`**: After the loop completes, `ans` contains a letter for each element in `rev_array`. The letter corresponds to the count of that element in the sub-list starting from its position in `rev_array`, mapped to the `alp` list.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` is equal to `l` because the loop iterates from 0 to `l-1`.
- **`l`**: Remains the input integer, which is the length of the `array`.
