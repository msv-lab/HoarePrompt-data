Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the letters corresponding to the counts of each element in `rev_array` starting from the end of `rev_array` up to the beginning, `j` is `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` reverses the `array` and assigns the reversed version to `rev_array`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `ans`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The reversed `array` is now stored in `rev_array`, which means `rev_array` contains the elements of `array` in reverse order.
