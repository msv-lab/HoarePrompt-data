Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with `-1` values, indicating that no computations have been done yet. The function `func_1` initializes the base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are correct according to the problem's constraints and the recurrence relation.

2. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correctly implemented. This relation is used to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board, ensuring that no two rooks attack each other. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required range.

3. **Invalid Positions Handling**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. For each move `(r, c)` provided in the input, both `r` and `c` are added to the `invalid` set. This correctly identifies the positions that cannot be used for placing additional rooks.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result for each test case is calculated as `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is correct because `n - len(invalid)` represents the number of available rows and columns after accounting for the invalid positions. The value `dp[n - len(invalid)]` gives the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions.

5. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`, and then reads the `k` moves. This input handling is correct and matches the problem description.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
