Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, representing the number of moves already played, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.** 

The value of `dp[2]` is now set to 3, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `dp[1]` remain unchanged.
