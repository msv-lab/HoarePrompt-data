Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move because \( r = c \). In such a scenario, the computer skips its turn, and this logic is not reflected in the current implementation. The `invalid` set only tracks rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, but it does not account for the special case where the computer skips its turn. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the number of possible final configurations. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 1
```
Here, the player places a rook at (1, 1), and the computer skips its turn. The program should account for this special case, but it does not, leading to an incorrect result.
