Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` with the base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. It then fills the array up to `n` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which correctly computes the number of valid configurations for a board of size `i`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

3. **Invalid Positions**: It keeps track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks using a set `invalid`. This ensures that the program correctly identifies the positions that cannot be used for placing additional rooks.

4. **Result Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the number of invalid positions from `n` and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, ensuring that even if there are no valid moves left, it prints `1` (since there is exactly one configuration with no additional moves).

Given these points, the program is logically sound and should produce the correct results for the given problem description.
