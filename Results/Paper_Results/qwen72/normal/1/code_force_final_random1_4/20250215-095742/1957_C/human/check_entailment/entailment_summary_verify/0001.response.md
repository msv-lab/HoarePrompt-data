### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The initialization of `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` is correct. For a 1x1 board, there is only one way to place a rook, and for a 2x2 board, there are three ways to place rooks without them attacking each other (one in each cell).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is derived correctly. It accounts for:
     - Placing a rook in the first row or column, leaving an (i-1) x (i-1) subproblem.
     - Placing a rook in the first row and a rook in the first column (but not in the same cell), leaving an (i-2) x (i-2) subproblem, and there are 2 * (i-1) ways to do this.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**:
   - The set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This is done by adding the row and column indices of each move to the set. This approach is correct because it ensures that no two rooks can be placed in the same row or column.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of possible final configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows and columns from `n` and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The `max(1, ...)` ensures that the result is at least 1, which is necessary because even if all rows and columns are invalid, there is still one configuration (no rooks placed).

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the dynamic programming approach is sound. The handling of invalid positions and the final configuration calculation are also correct.

Final: **True**
