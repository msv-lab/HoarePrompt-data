Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, we need at least `(y + 1) // 2` screens to fit all 2x2 icons. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), and the remaining 7 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the number of remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so the total number of remaining cells is `15 * z - y * 4`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `if m < x`: If the remaining cells are not enough to fit all 1x1 icons, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This ensures that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on new screens, with each screen having a maximum capacity of 15 cells.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens `z` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Variable Name Confusion**: The variable `a` is used both for the number of test cases and in the calculation `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This is a potential source of confusion and should be avoided.
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic for calculating the initial number of screens `z` and the remaining cells `m` is correct.
  - The adjustment for 1x1 icons is also correct, but the variable name `a` should be changed to avoid confusion.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Final Verdict:
The original program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with variable naming. After correcting the variable names, the program should work correctly for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
