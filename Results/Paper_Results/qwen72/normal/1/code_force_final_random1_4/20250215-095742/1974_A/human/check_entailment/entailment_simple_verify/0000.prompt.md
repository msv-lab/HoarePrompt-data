You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, `a` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed, `i` is `a-1`, `z` is the final value of `(y + 1) // 2` after the last iteration, and `m` is the final value of `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4` after the last iteration. If `m` < `a` during any iteration, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 14) // 15` for that iteration, and retains this value for subsequent iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically, the variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which is intended to represent the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that each screen can hold exactly 15 1x1 icons, which is not always true due to the placement of 2x2 icons.

Additionally, the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. It should be `if m < x:` instead.

Here's a specific test case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
15 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this test case, there are 15 1x1 icons and 0 2x2 icons. The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required as 2, whereas the correct answer is 1, since all 15 1x1 icons can fit into a single screen.
