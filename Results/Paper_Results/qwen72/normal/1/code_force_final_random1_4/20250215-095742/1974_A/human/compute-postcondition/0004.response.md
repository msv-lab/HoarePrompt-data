The code snippet `m = 15 * z - y * 4` updates the value of `m`. To determine the new value of `m`, we need to consider the initial values of `z` and `y`.

- `z` is defined as `(y + 1) // 2`.
- `y` is an integer provided by user input.

Let's calculate the new value of `m`:

1. `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`.
2. `m` is then calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `m` is updated to `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
