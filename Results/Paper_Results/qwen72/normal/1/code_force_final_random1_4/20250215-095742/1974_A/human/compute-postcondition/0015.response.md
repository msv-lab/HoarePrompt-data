To determine what will be printed by the `print(z)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `z` is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\).

2. **Conditional Update:**
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then:
     - `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15\).
     - `m` is updated to \(15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4\).
   - Otherwise, `z` and `m` retain their original values.

3. **Determine the Value of `z`:**
   - Initially, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\).
   - If `m` is less than `a`, `z` is updated to:
     \[
     z = (y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15
     \]
   - If `m` is not less than `a`, `z` remains \((y + 1) // 2\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(z)` statement will print the value of `z` after the conditional update.

Given the initial state and the conditional update, the value of `z` depends on whether `m` is less than `a`. Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **z (where z is either (y + 1) // 2 or (y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15, depending on whether m is less than a)**
