### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values `x` and `y` for each.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculation is correct. It determines the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. Each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), and the remaining 7 cells can be used for 1x1 icons. Therefore, `(y + 1) // 2` gives the correct number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculation is also correct. It computes the number of remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so the total number of remaining cells is `15 * z - y * 4`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `if m < x`: This condition checks if the remaining cells are not enough to fit all 1x1 icons. If true, additional screens are needed.
   - `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`: This calculation is correct. It ensures that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on new screens, with each screen having a maximum capacity of 15 cells. The expression `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` correctly rounds up the number of additional screens needed.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens `z` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Variable Name Confusion**: The variable `a` is used both for the number of test cases and in the calculation `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This is a potential source of confusion and should be avoided. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program, as the variable `a` is not used in the calculation.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Final Verdict:
The original program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with variable naming. After correcting the variable names, the program should work correctly for all test cases.

Final: **True**
