Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.***
