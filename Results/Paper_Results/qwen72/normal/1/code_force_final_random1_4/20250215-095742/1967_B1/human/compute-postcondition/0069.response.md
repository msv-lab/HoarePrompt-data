Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is updated to the value of `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`) retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
