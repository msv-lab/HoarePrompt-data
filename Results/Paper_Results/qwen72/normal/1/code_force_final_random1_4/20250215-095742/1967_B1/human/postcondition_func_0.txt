The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and incrementally adds a computed value based on a loop that runs from 2 to `m`. The loop updates `ans` by adding the result of a division operation involving `n` and the current loop index. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
