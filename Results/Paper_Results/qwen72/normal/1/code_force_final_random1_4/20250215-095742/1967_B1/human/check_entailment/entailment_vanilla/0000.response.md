### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to consider the properties of \(\gcd(a, b)\).
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is more restrictive. Specifically, \(a\) must be such that \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and starts a loop from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\) (starting from 2), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.
   - It uses the formula `g = int(n / count)` to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition.
   - It then checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when \(b = 1\) by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values seems to be based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the specific logic inside the loop might not be entirely clear or correct. The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic inside the loop might not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` might be too restrictive and could lead to missing valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the logic inside the loop, the program does not seem to correctly implement the required solution.

Correctness: **False**
