Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the value of `countmins` to be the integer value of `count - 1`.
- Since `count` is 3, `countmins` becomes `int(3 - 1)`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `g`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
