Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 4) - 3 / 4) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`.
- The value of `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.
- The new value of `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 4) - 3 / 4) + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `m`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged.
