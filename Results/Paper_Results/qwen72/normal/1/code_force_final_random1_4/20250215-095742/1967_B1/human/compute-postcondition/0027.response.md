Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 5, `ans` is equal to `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 4) - 3 / 4) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / 5)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
