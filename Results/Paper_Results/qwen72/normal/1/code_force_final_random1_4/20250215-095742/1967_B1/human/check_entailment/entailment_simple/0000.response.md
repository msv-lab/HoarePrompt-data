### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then iterates over `count` from 2 to \(m\):
     - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
     - It calculates `g` as \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor \).
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding \( \left\lfloor \frac{g - \text{countmins}}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
     - It increments `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to \(n\), which is correct because for \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) satisfy the condition \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\).
   - The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it correctly calculates the number of valid \(a\) values by checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop ensures that the number of valid pairs is correctly counted and added to `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(m = 1\) correctly by not entering the loop and printing \(n\).
   - The program also handles the case where \(n\) and \(m\) are large (up to \(2 \times 10^6\)) efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
