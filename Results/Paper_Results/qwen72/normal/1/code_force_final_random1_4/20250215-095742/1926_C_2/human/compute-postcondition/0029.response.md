Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + sum of digits of (n + 1)`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i` (which is `n + 1`).
- For each digit `j` in the string representation of `i`, the value `int(j)` is added to `pd[i]`.
- After all iterations, `pd[n + 1]` will be updated to include the sum of the digits of `n + 1` in addition to its initial value `pd[n + 1] + pd[n]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`, and the initial values of `pd` for indices 1 to `n`) remain unchanged.
