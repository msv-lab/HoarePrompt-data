The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of its original value by 10. This means the last digit of the original `num` is removed. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the last digit and twice the second last digit of the original `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^2 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the sum of the last digit and twice the second last digit of the original `num`.**
