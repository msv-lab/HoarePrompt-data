The value of `a` is updated by adding the last digit of `num` to its current value. Since `a` was initially the last digit of the original `num`, and `num` is now the original `num` divided by 10, the last digit of the new `num` is the second last digit of the original `num`. Therefore, `a` is now the sum of the last digit and the second last digit of the original `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^4 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the sum of the last digit and the second last digit of the original `num`.**
