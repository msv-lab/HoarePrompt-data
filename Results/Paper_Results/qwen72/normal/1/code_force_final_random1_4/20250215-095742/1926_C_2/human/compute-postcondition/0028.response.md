Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the first character in the string representation of `n + 1`, `pd[n + 1]` is updated to `pd[n + 1] + int(j)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `pd[i]` is updated by adding the integer value of `j` to it.
- `i` is `n + 1`, so `pd[n + 1]` is specifically updated.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
