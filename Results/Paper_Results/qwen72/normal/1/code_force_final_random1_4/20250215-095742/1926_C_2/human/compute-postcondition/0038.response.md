The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `N`, and `pd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `N` is 200001, and `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.**
