The value of `a` is updated to `a + num % 10`. Since `a` was initially 0, the new value of `a` is `num % 10`. The value of `num` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is `num % 10`.
Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is `num % 10`.**
