To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `num != 0`. Given the current state:

- `num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is 0

Since `num` is already defined within a range that excludes 0, the condition `num != 0` is inherently satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
