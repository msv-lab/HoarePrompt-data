Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the sum of the last digit and the second last digit of the original `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is updated to be the integer division of the original `num` by 10, which means `num` is now one-tenth of its original value. The condition 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^4 (for the original `num`) is updated to 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3 for the new `num`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is derived from the original `num`.
