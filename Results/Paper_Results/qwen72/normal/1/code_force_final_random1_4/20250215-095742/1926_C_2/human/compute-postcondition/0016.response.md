The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is '2'. Since `i` is a single-digit number, its string representation contains only one character, which is '2'. Therefore, after the first iteration, there are no more characters left in the string representation of `i` to iterate over.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be a number with more than one digit. However, since the only state we can adjust is `j` and the string representation of `i`, and `i` is already at 2, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more characters in `str(i)` to assign to `j`.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, but with the understanding that the loop will not execute again because `i` is a single-digit number.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`, `i` is 2, `j` is '2'**.
