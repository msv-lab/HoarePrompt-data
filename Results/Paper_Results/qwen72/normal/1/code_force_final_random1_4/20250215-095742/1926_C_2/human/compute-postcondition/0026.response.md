The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- `N` is greater than `n + 1`.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + int(j)`, where `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.

After executing the code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)`:

- `pd[i]` (which is `pd[n + 1]`) is updated by adding the integer value of `j` to its current value.

Therefore, the new value of `pd[i]` is `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + int(j) + int(j)`, which simplifies to `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + 2 * int(j)`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + 2 * int(j)`, `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.**
