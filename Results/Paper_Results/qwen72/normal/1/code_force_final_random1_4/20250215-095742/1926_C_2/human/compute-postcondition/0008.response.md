The code snippet `a = a + num % 10` updates the value of `a` by adding the last digit of `num` to its current value. Given that `a` is initially the sum of the last digit and the second last digit of the original `num`, and `num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3 (original `num` divided by 10), the new value of `a` will be the sum of the last digit and the second last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the current `num`.

Since `num` is the original `num` divided by 10, the last digit of the current `num` is the second last digit of the original `num`. Therefore, the new value of `a` will be the sum of the last digit of the original `num` (which was already part of `a`) and twice the second last digit of the original `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < `num` <= 2 * 10^3 (original `num` divided by 10), `a` is the sum of the last digit and twice the second last digit of the original `num`.**
