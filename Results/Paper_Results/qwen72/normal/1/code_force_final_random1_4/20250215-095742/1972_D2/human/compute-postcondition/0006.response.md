Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called, with `t - 4` remaining iterations.** 

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called again, reducing the number of remaining iterations by 1. The initial state specified that there were `t - 3` remaining iterations, so after calling `func_1()`, there are now `t - 4` remaining iterations. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
