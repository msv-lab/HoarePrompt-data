The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` was 1, so after the increment, `y` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 6\) and \(m \geq 3\), `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 6, m // 3)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**
