The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop iterates `t` times, and at the end of the last iteration, there are `t - 2` remaining iterations. This means that the loop has already run once, and it needs to run one more time to complete the `t - 2` remaining iterations plus the current one.

At the start of the next iteration, the placeholder `_` does not hold a specific value and is incremented implicitly by the loop mechanism. The number of remaining iterations is now `t - 3`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called, with `t - 3` remaining iterations.**
