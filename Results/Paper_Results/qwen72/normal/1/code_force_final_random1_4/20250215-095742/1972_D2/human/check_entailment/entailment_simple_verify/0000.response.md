### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - Reads `n` and `m` from input.
   - Iterates over `x` while \(x \times x \le n\).
   - For each `x`, iterates over `y` while \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
   - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If true, increments `cnt` by \(\min\left(\frac{n}{(x + y) \times x}, \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y}\right)\).
   - Prints `cnt`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it uses the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` to check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, which is not sufficient to ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Correctness Check:
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - However, the problem requires that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This means that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

2. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the pair \((a, b) = (2, 2)\):
     - \(\gcd(2, 2) = 2\)
     - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)
     - \(a + b = 2 + 2 = 4\)
     - \(4 \mod 4 = 0\), so the pair \((2, 2)\) should be counted.
   - The program correctly counts this pair because \(\gcd(2, 2) = 2\) and the condition is met.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates over all possible pairs \((x, y)\) and checks if they are coprime.
   - It then increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \times x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \times y}\), which ensures that the pairs are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) is necessary but not sufficient alone. However, the program's logic ensures that the pairs are correctly counted based on the problem's requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program does correctly handle the problem's requirements and counts the valid pairs as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
