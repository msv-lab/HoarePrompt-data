To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is set to `min(n / 2, m // 2)`.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - The first condition is \((x + y) * x \leq n\).
     - Substituting the current values: \((1 + 2) * 1 = 3 \leq n\).
     - This condition is satisfied as long as \(n \geq 3\).
   - The second condition is \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
     - Substituting the current values: \((1 + 2) * 2 = 6 \leq m\).
     - This condition is satisfied as long as \(m \geq 6\).

4. **Determine the Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 3, and `m` must be at least 6.

### Conclusion:
Since the conditions are already met with the given values of `x` and `y`, no adjustments are needed to the variables `x` and `y`. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to confirm that `n` and `m` meet the required conditions.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\), `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is set to `min(n / 2, m // 2)`**.
