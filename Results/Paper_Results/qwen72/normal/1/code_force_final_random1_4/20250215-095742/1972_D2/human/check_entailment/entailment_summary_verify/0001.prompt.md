You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains the same integer value read from the input, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - If \(\gcd(a, b) = d\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(dy \cdot d\) is a multiple of \(dx + dy\), which simplifies to \(d^2 y\) is a multiple of \(d(x + y)\), or \(dy\) is a multiple of \(x + y\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If these conditions are met, it counts the number of valid pairs by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

5. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the solution works for multiple inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case and handles multiple test cases as required.
