The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraint provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function signature does not include any parameters. Assuming the function is intended to operate under the constraint that `t` is a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, but without any parameters in the function signature, the function's behavior cannot be directly inferred from the given information. 

If we assume the function is supposed to generate or return something related to the constraint (e.g., a random number within the range, or some computation involving `t`), we would need more specific information about the expected output.

Given the current information, the function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is unclear based on the provided details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
