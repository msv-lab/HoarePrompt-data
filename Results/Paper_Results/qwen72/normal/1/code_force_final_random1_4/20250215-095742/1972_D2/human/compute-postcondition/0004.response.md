Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called, with `t - 2` remaining iterations.** 

The function `func_1()` has been called again, reducing the number of remaining iterations by 1. The value of `t` remains the same, and `_` continues to be a placeholder with no specific value.
