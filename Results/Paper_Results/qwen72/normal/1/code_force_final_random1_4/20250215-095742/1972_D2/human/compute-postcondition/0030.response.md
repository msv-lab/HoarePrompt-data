Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 3. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 12, m // 12)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `cnt` remains the same, as it depends on the values of `x` and `y` and the initial value of `cnt`.
