To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 3.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

4. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - For `x = 3` and `y = 3`:
     - `(x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
     - `(x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`

5. **Check the Conditions:**
   - The first condition is `(x + y) * x <= n`, which translates to `18 <= n`.
   - The second condition is `(x + y) * y <= m`, which translates to `18 <= m`.

6. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` and `m` are already given to be within the range \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), and the current values of `x` and `y` are 3, the conditions `18 <= n` and `18 <= m` are already satisfied.
   - Therefore, no adjustments to `n` or `m` are necessary.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The loop can proceed without any changes to the current state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` remains unchanged**.
