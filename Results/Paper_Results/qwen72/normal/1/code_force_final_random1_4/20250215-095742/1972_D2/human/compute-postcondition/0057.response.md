Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. It then calculates the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied. The function prints the count of such pairs. After the function completes, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any value. **
