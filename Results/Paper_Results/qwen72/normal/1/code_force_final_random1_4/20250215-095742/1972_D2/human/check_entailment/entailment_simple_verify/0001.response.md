### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - If \(\gcd(a, b) = d\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) simplifies to \(d^2 y\) being a multiple of \(d(x + y)\), which further simplifies to \(dy\) being a multiple of \(x + y\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If these conditions are met, it counts the number of valid pairs by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

5. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the solution works for multiple inputs.

6. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly initializes and updates variables.
   - The loop conditions ensure that the program only considers valid pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) are satisfied.
   - The counting mechanism using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is appropriate for counting valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case and handles multiple test cases as required.

Final: **True**
