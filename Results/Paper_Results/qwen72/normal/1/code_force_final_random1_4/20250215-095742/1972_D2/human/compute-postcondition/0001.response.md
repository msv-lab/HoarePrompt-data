The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the value `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, this already ensures that `t` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, for clarity, we can state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed)**
