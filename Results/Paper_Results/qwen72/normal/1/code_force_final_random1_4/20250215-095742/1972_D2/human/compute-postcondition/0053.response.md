Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 4, `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\), and `cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged, including the constraints on `n` and `m`, the definition of `y`, and the increment of `cnt`.
