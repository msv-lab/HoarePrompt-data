The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 2, so the new value of `y` is 3. The GCD condition for updating `cnt` is not checked or modified by this code snippet, so `cnt` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
