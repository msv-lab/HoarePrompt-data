Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The value of `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \times x > n\). The value of `y` is 1. The value of `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: The loop increments `x` by 1 in each iteration until \(x \times x > n\). Therefore, after the loop finishes, `x` will be the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \times x > n\).
- **`y`**: The inner loop resets `y` to 1 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. Since the loop exits when \(x \times x > n\), the final value of `y` will be 1.
- **`cnt`**: This variable accumulates the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all valid pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied. The final value of `cnt` will be the total count of such pairs.
