Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The value of `x` is 2, and `y` is the largest integer such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\). The value of `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop continues to increment `y` until the condition \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\) is no longer satisfied.
- The final value of `y` will be the largest integer that still allows the loop to run at least once.
- The variable `cnt` accumulates the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each valid pair of `x` and `y` where the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
