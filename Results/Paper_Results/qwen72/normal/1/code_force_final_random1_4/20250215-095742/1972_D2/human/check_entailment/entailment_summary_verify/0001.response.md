### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - If \(\gcd(a, b) = d\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) simplifies to \(d^2 y\) being a multiple of \(d(x + y)\), which further simplifies to \(dy\) being a multiple of \(x + y\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If these conditions are met, it counts the number of valid pairs by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The loop `while x * x <= n` ensures that \(x\) is iterated up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is efficient.
   - The inner loop `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` ensures that \(y\) is iterated within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which is necessary for the mathematical insight.
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of the two quotients, which correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

5. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the solution works for multiple test cases as required.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case and handles multiple test cases as required.

Final: **True**
