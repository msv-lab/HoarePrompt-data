Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of distinct integers `x`. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` with `a`, `x`, and `k` as arguments and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes `t` sets of inputs, where `t` is a positive integer provided initially. After processing all sets, the function terminates without returning any value. **
