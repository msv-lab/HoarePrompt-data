Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` (which is also the length of the list `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable indicates how many bullets are left after the last monster's health was reduced to 0 or when there are no more monsters within the firing range. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, or it is equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop, except `distance` which is now `distance + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now equal to 0 or the remaining amount of health of the last monster that could not be fully defeated. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, or it is equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged. The `distance` variable is now `distance + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop will continue to execute until either `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`. At the end of all iterations, `rest` will be 0 if there were enough bullets to reduce the health of all remaining monsters to 0, or it will be the remaining number of bullets if there are no more monsters with health greater than 0 to target. The `pos` variable will point to the next monster in `sorted_indices` that still has health greater than 0, or it will be equal to `len(sorted_indices)` if all monsters have been defeated. The `a` list will contain the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged. The `distance` variable is now `distance + 1` if the loop executed at least once.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
