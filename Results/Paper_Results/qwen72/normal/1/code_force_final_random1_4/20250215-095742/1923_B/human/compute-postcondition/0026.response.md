Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is now `rest - delta - delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`, `x` is a list of integers, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `a` and `x`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-3]]` (depending on the condition) is not equal to `distance`, and `pos` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pos` is incremented by 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state, except for the updated reference to `pos` in the conditions involving `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-3]]`.
