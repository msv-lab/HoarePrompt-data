Postcondition: ***All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now equal to `k - delta`. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, and `pos` may be incremented by 1 if the current monster's health is 0. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop, except `distance` which is now `distance + 1`. The `delta` variable is now equal to the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (or `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` if `pos` was incremented). The health of the monster at position `sorted_indices[pos]` (or `sorted_indices[pos - 1]` if `pos` was incremented) in the `a` list is now reduced by `delta` (and is 0 if `pos` was incremented).***
