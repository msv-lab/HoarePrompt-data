Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distances from the player.
   - It iterates through these sorted indices, simulating the process of firing bullets and moving monsters closer.
   - It checks if any monster reaches the player before being killed, returning `False` if so.
   - It returns `True` if all monsters are killed before reaching the player.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, the health of the monsters (`a`), and their positions (`x`).
   - It calls `func_1` with these values and prints "YES" if the function returns `True`, and "NO" otherwise.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, ensuring that the program correctly determines whether the player can survive and kill all the monsters.
