Postcondition: ***All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now equal to `k - delta`. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, and if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged. The `distance` variable is now `distance + 1`. The `delta` variable is now the minimum of the original `rest` (which was `k`) and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` if `pos` was incremented. The health of the monster at position `sorted_indices[pos]` or `sorted_indices[pos - 1]` in the `a` list is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta` or 0 if `pos` was incremented.***
