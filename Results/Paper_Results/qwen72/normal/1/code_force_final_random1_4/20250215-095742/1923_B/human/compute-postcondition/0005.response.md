To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `x` is a list of integers input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The code calls a function `func_1(a, x, k)`. The result of this function call will determine what is printed.
2. **Conditional Print Statement**: The `print` statement will print 'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, and 'NO' if it returns `False`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.
- However, based on the structure of the `print` statement, we know that it will print either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be either 'YES' or 'NO', but without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine which one it will be.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (depending on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`)**
