Output State: **`rest` is `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` before the subtraction and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `rest` was initially `k - delta`.
- `delta` is the minimum of `rest` (which was `k - delta`) and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- After executing `rest -= delta`, `rest` becomes `(k - delta) - delta`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * delta`.
- The value of `pos` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
- The value of `delta` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
