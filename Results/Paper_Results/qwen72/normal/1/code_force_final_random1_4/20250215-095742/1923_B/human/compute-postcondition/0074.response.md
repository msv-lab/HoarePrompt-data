Output State: **`rest` is `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` before the subtraction and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, with `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` being reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`, which means `rest` is now `k - 3 * delta`.
- The value of `pos` remains the same as it was initially, which is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.
- The value of `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` as per the initial conditions.
- If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` before the subtraction and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, with `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` being reduced by `delta`.
- Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
