Output State: **`rest` is `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.
- The values of `rest`, `pos`, and `delta` remain as they were defined in the initial state.
- No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
