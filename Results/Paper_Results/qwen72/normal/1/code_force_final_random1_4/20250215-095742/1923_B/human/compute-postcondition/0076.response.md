Output State: **`rest` is `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `pos` is now `pos + 1`, `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` is reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, moving to the next index in `sorted_indices`. The previous updates to `delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` remain valid, and all other variables remain unchanged.
