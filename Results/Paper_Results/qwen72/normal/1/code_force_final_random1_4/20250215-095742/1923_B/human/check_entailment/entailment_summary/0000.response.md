Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game logic as described in the problem statement.
   - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It iterates through the sorted list of monsters, firing up to `k` bullets per second to reduce their health.
   - If a monster's position becomes 0 (i.e., it reaches the player), the function returns `False`.
   - If all monsters are defeated before any reach the player, the function returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n`, the number of bullets `k`, the health of each monster `a`, and the initial positions of each monster `x`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The sorting of monsters by distance ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is a crucial part of the strategy to survive.
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game mechanics, including the movement of monsters and the firing of bullets.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and should work correctly for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
