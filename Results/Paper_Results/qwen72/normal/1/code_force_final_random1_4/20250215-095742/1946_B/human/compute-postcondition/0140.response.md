To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `smin` is a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least 1.
- `t` retains its initial value and conditions.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input.
- `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`.
- `sm` is updated to `0` if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to `-111`. Otherwise, `sm` retains its initial value of `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10`.

### Code:
```python
sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the values of `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`.
   - `smin` is a list where each element is the minimum value encountered in `suf` up to that index.

2. **Calculate `suf[1]`**:
   - `suf[1]` is `l[0]`.

3. **Calculate `smin[1]`**:
   - Since `smin` is constructed such that each element is the minimum value encountered in `suf` up to that index, `smin[1]` is the minimum of `suf[0]` and `suf[1]`.
   - `smin[1]` is `min(0, l[0])`.

4. **Calculate `sm`**:
   - `sm` is assigned the value `suf[1] - smin[1]`.
   - `sm` becomes `l[0] - min(0, l[0])`.

5. **Determine the final value of `sm`**:
   - If `l[0]` is non-negative, `min(0, l[0])` is 0, so `sm` becomes `l[0] - 0 = l[0]`.
   - If `l[0]` is negative, `min(0, l[0])` is `l[0]`, so `sm` becomes `l[0] - l[0] = 0`.

### Output State:
- `smin` is a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least 1.
- `t` retains its initial value and conditions.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input.
- `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`.
- `sm` is `l[0]` if `l[0]` is non-negative, otherwise `sm` is 0.

Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0.
