The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `j` is part of the loop head and `t` is the upper limit for `j`, the state adjustment for the next iteration would be:

- `j` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`smin`, `i`, `n`, `t`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `sm`) remain unchanged.

State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `t`, `j` is `j + 1`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.**
