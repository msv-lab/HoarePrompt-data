Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 0, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions. If `suf[2] - smin[2]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is `-111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[2] - smin[2]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.***
