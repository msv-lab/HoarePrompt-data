Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input.** 

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the result in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
