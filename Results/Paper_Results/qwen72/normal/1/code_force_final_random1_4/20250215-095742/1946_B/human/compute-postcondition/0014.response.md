Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `j` remains 0.
- The list `b` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`.
- The variable `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The list `suf` now contains `n + 1` elements. The first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
