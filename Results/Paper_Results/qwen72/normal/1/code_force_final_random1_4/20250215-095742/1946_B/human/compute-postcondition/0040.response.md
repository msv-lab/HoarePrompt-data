To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `j` is 0.
- `b` is a list of strings from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`.
- `i` is 1.
- `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`.
- `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `suf[1] - smin[1]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n + 1)`.
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `smin`, `sm`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is 2, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `suf[1] - smin[1]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.**
