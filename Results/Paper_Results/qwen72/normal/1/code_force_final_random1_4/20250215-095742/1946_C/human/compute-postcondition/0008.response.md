Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls the `solve` function. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value and the state of the program indicates that the `solve` function has been called the specified number of times. The function does not modify any global variables or states outside of its scope. **
