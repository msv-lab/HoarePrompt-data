The function `solve()` is called, but without knowing the implementation details of `solve()`, we cannot determine exactly how it affects the variables. However, based on the initial state, we know that the number of sets of input data is greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `solve()` has been called.

Since the function `solve()` has been called, it may modify the state of the program, including variables, but without more information about what `solve()` does, we can only state that it has been called. The values of the variables that are not modified by `solve()` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The number of sets of input data is greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `solve()` has been called.**
