The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. The loop's continuation depends on the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. At the end of the last iteration, the number of sets of input data must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the number of sets of input data must still be greater than 0, and `_` must be incremented by 1.

However, since `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is called at the start of each iteration, it will read a new line from the input, and the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` will be re-evaluated. Therefore, the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to reflect the next iteration, but the condition on the number of sets of input data remains the same as it is re-evaluated at the start of each iteration.

State: **The number of sets of input data (read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converted to an integer) must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the function `solve()` has been called.**
