To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
   - `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `na_frente` is -1.
   - `pos_final` is decreased by 1.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` (which is \(10^{12}\)) and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `best` starts with a very large value (\(10^{12}\)).
   - `total` is calculated as the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - For each valid `v`, `best` is updated to the minimum value between the current `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(best)` statement will output the final value of `best` after all the updates have been made.

Given the initial state and the logic, the value of `best` will be the minimum cost found during the process of updating `best` with the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v`.

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum cost found.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value between the initial best (10^12) and the updated total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for each valid v)**
