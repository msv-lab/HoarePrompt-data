Output State: **`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, `custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[max_p - 2]`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, and `a_values` retain their original values and relationships, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
