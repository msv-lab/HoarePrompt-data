The only variables in the loop head are `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `v` based on the loop's behavior.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `v` is the current value of `na_frente`.
- The loop decrements `v` by 1 at the start of each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `v` must be decremented by 1.
- `v` must still be greater than or equal to -1 (since the loop runs until `v` is -1).

Given that `v` starts at `na_frente` and is decremented by 1, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer provided by the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 1`**.
