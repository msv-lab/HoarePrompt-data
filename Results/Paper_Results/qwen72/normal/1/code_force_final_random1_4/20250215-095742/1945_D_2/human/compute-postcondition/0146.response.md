The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears to accept multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.**
