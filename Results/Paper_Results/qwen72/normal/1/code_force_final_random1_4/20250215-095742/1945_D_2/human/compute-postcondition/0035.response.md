The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding the value at index `v` of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it. Given that `v` is -1, this means the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b` is added to `total`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, and the loop has terminated.**
