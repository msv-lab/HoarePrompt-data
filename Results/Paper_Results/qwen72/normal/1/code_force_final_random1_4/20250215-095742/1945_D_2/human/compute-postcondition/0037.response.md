Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, and the loop has terminated. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. Additionally, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
