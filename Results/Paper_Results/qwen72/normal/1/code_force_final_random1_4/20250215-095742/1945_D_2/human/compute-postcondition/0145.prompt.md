Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9; `cases` is an integer input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed), `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the smaller values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `v` exists, `best` remains 10^12.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values. The variable `v` will be -1 (since the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` down to -1). The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, considering the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` will be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
