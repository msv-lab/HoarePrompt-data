Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions in a queue. The program iterates over each test case, reads the necessary inputs, and calculates the minimum cost using a greedy approach. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, the values of `n` (number of people in the queue), `m` (maximum allowable final position), and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a very large number (10^12) to keep track of the minimum cost found.

3. **Loop Through Positions**: The program iterates from the last position to the first (from `n-1` to `0`):
   - If the current position `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` (i.e., within the target range), it checks if the current total cost plus the cost to change positions (`a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a[v]` and `b[v]` to the total cost.
   - If the current position `v` is greater than `pos_final`, it simply adds the minimum of `a[v]` and `b[v]` to the total cost.

4. **Output**: After processing all positions for a test case, the program prints the `best` cost found.

The logic appears to be sound and aligns with the problem statement. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
