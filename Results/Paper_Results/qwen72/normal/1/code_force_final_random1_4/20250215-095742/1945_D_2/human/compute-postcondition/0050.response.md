The only object in the loop head is the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. The loop can execute as long as `c` is less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, and `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v`.**
