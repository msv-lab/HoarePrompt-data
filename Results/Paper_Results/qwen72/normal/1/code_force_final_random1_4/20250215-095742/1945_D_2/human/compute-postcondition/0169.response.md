Postcondition: **`a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the last element in the list `b`, `b` must be a non-empty collection, `b_values` now contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `custo`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state, and `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`.**
