Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `best` is 10^12, `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
