Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is `t - 1`, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 1, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[1]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[1]`. If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains `False`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `opNum` is updated to `a[1]`.
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - a[1]`.
- The rest of the values in the list `a` remain unchanged except for the specific indices mentioned in the initial state.
- The conditions for `stop` and the values of other variables remain as specified in the initial state.
