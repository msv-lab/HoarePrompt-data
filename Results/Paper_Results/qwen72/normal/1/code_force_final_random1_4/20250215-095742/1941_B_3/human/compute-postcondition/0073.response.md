Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is now `a[2]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is now `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is now `a[i + 1] - 5 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is now `a[i + 2] - 3 * opNum`. If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from its current value.
- Initially, `a[i + 2]` was `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`.
- After executing the code, `a[i + 2]` becomes `a[i + 2] - 3 * opNum`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
