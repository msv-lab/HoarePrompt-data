Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is equal to `t`.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `opNum` is equal to `a[1]`.
- `a[0]` is 0.
- `a[1]` is now `a[1] - opNum`.
- `a[2]` is now `a[2]`.
- `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 3 * opNum`.
- `stop` is False unless `a[1]` is less than 0, in which case `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given this state, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
