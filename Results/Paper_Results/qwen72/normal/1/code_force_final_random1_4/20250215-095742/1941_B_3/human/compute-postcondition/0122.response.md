To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's analyze the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables and objects:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is `t - 1`.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `opNum` is `a[n-3]`.

### Transformations:
- `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are set to 0.
- `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
- `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
- `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[n-3]`.
- `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[n-3]`.
- If `stop` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration because at least one `a[i]` is less than 0 during the loop execution. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0.
- `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The transformations and conditions described in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and the transformations applied to the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
