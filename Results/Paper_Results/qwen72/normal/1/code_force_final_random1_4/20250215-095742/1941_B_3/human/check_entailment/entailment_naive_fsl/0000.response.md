Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the program only checks the first two elements and the last two elements of the array to determine if the operation can be applied to make all elements zero. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire array and the cumulative effect of the operations.

A counterexample where the program fails is:
- Input: `5\n1 2 3 4 5`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Actual Output: `YES`

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it only checks the first two and last two elements, which do not violate the conditions checked in the program. However, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations for this input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
