The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` modifies the list `a` by subtracting the value of `opNum` from the element at index `i + 2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `opNum` is 0. Therefore, the element at index `i + 2` (which is `a[4]`) is modified by subtracting 0 from it, which does not change its value.

Let's summarize the output state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `numTest` is equal to `t`
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 2
- `opNum` is 0
- `a[0]` is 0
- `a[1]` is `a[1] - a[2]` (unchanged since `a[2]` is 0)
- `a[2]` is 0
- `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * a[2]` (unchanged since `a[2]` is 0)
- `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 2 * opNum` (which is `a[3] - 0`)
- `a[4]` is now `a[4] - opNum` (which is `a[4] - 0`)
- `stop` remains False

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is 0, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - a[2]` (unchanged since `a[2]` is 0), `a[2]` is 0, `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * a[2]` (unchanged since `a[2]` is 0), `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 2 * opNum` (which is `a[3] - 0`), `a[4]` is now `a[4] - opNum` (which is `a[4] - 0`), `stop` remains False.**
