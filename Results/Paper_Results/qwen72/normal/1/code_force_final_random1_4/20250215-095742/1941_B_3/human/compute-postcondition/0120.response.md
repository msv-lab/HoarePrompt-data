Let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the list `a` to understand what will be printed when the `print('NO')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is `t - 1`.
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the subsequent operations).
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `opNum` is `a[n-3]`.

### Operations on `a`:
1. `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are set to 0.
2. `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
3. `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
4. `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
5. `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[n-3]`.
6. `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[n-3]`.

### Conditions:
- The last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0.
- The second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0.
- If `stop` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration because at least one `a[i]` is less than 0 during the loop execution. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.

### Analysis:
Given the operations and conditions, the key point is the final state of the list `a` and the condition for the `stop` variable. The `print('NO')` statement is executed, which means the loop did not continue to the next iteration, implying that no `a[i]` was less than 0 during the loop execution.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
