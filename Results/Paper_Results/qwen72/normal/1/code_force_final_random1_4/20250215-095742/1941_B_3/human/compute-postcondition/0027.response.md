Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is now `a[1] - opNum`, `a[2]` is now `a[2]`, `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 3 * opNum`, `stop` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
