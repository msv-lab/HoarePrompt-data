You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, and `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive). The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the hour part of the time has been converted to 12-hour format and printed with AM/PM notation. The final state of `t` is 0, and the final state of `s` and `h` is the last user-provided values before the loop ended.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1440) and `s` (a string in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time). It returns a new time string in the format "hh:mm" after adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
