You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings `s` each representing a time in 24-hour format ("hh:mm"). For each input time, it converts the hour part to 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" based on the original hour value, then prints the converted time. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the final state of `t` is 0, while `s` and `h` hold the last user-provided values before the loop ended.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing a time in 24-hour format. This matches the problem description.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - **Hour Conversion**:
     - If the hour is `00`, it converts to `12` in 12-hour format.
     - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it remains the same.
     - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 to convert to the 12-hour format.
   - **Minute Handling**: The minutes remain unchanged and are directly appended to the converted hour.
   - **AM/PM Determination**: The function correctly appends "AM" if the hour is less than 12, and "PM" otherwise.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the time in the required format: "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".
   - Leading zeros are preserved as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `00:00` converting to `12:00 AM` and `12:00` converting to `12:00 PM`.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic is clear and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
