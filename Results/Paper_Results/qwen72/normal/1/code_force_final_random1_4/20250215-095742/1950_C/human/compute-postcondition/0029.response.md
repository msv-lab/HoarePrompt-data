Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442, `s` is a new user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", and `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which is `s[:2]`. If `h` is '00' or `int(h) <= 12`, the condition holds true. If `int(h) > 12`, the condition does not hold, but the values of `t`, `s`, and `h` remain unchanged.***
