The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings `s` each representing a time in 24-hour format ("hh:mm"). For each input time, it converts the hour part to 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" based on the original hour value, then prints the converted time. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the final state of `t` is 0, while `s` and `h` hold the last user-provided values before the loop ended.
