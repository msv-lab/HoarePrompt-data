Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing a time in 24-hour format. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - **Hour Conversion**:
     - If the hour is `00`, it correctly converts to `12` in 12-hour format.
     - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it remains the same.
     - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it correctly subtracts 12 to convert to the 12-hour format.
   - **Minute Handling**: The minutes remain unchanged and are directly appended to the converted hour.
   - **AM/PM Determination**: The function correctly appends "AM" if the hour is less than 12, and "PM" otherwise.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the time in the required format: "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".
   - Leading zeros are preserved as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `00:00` converting to `12:00 AM` and `12:00` converting to `12:00 PM`.
   - It also correctly handles other edge cases like `01:01` converting to `01:01 AM` and `23:59` converting to `11:59 PM`.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic is clear and follows the problem requirements accurately.
   - The use of `print` statements ensures that the output is formatted correctly and matches the expected output format.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Final: **True**
