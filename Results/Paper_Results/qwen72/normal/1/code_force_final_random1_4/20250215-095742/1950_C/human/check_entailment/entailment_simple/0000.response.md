Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it correctly converts it to `12`.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it correctly subtracts 12 from the hour and prints it with a leading zero if necessary.

3. **Minute Handling**: The program correctly appends the minutes part of the time (`s[2:]`) to the hour part.

4. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - It correctly appends `AM` if the hour is less than 12.
   - It correctly appends `PM` if the hour is 12 or greater.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the time in the required format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `00:00` (which should be `12:00 AM`), `12:00` (which should be `12:00 PM`), and `23:59` (which should be `11:59 PM`) correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all specified requirements and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
