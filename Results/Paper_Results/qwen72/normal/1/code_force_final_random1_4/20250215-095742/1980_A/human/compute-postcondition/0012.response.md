Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index 0 to 6 represents the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`.
- For each character `prob` in `a`, the corresponding index in `freq` (calculated as `ord(prob) - ord('A')`) is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `freq` will contain the counts of each character from 'A' to 'G' in `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
