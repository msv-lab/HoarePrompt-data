Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and has been fully processed, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of corresponding characters in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the new value of `missing` using the formula `sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)`.
- The value of `missing` is updated based on the current values of `m` and `freq`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `freq`, `_`) remain unchanged except for `missing` which is now the calculated sum.
- The index `_` is incremented by 1, indicating that the next tuple in `test_cases` will be processed in the next iteration.
