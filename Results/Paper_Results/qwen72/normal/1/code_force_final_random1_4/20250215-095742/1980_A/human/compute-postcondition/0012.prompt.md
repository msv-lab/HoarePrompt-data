Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where one of the elements at index 0 to 6 is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index 1 is incremented by 1, `prob` is the second element of `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least three elements, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index 1 is incremented by 1 and the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the third element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
