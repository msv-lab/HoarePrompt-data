Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by iterating over the test cases and extracting the necessary values (`n`, `m`, and `a`).

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and updates the frequency of each difficulty level.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The function calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by computing `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f`. This ensures that if there are fewer than `m` problems of a certain difficulty, the difference is added to the total missing count.

4. **Result Aggregation**: The function appends the total number of missing problems for each test case to the `results` list and returns this list.

5. **Output**: The main script correctly calls `func_1` with the test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function processes each test case as expected and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
