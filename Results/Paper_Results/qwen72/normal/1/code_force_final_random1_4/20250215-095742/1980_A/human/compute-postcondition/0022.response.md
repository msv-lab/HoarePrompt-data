The only objects in the loop head are the variable `prob` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` must contain at least two elements, and `prob` is the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `prob` will be the third element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must contain at least three elements, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the third element in `a`.**
