Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1.**
