Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted but has multiple consecutive '1's or '0's. For example, consider the input `11111111`. According to the problem description, the output should be `1` because the string is already sorted. However, the current implementation will output `8`, which is incorrect.

To illustrate this issue, let's break down the execution of the program with the input `11111111`:
- The loop iterates through the string, and since all characters are the same, `s[j] == s[j + 1]` is always true.
- The `count` variable increments for each iteration, leading to a final count of `8`.

This behavior is incorrect because the string is already sorted, and no cuts are needed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
