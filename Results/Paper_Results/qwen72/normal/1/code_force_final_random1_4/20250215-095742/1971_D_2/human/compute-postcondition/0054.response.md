Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with any length greater than 3, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `count` is 4 if `s[j]` (which is `s[2]`) is not equal to `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[3]`). If `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
