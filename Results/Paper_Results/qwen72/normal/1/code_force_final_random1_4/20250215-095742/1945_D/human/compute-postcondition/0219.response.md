Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from user input, each consisting of the number of people in a queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and two lists of integers (a and b). For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values in the lists a and b, considering the constraints of n and m. The function then prints the calculated cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the user with the printed costs and no returned value. **
