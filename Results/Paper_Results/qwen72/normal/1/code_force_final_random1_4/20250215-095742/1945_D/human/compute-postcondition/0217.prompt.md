Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the list `custos` will contain the final cost values for each of the `x` test cases, with each value being the result of the cost calculation performed within the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `i` will retain their values as they were at the start of each iteration, but `i` will have reached the value `x-1` (the last index of the loop). The variable `custo` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will hold the final cost for the current test case at the end of each iteration. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` will be populated with the integer values from the input lists `a` and `b` for each test case, but these lists will be reinitialized for each new test case. The input variables `nf`, `a`, and `b` will be read from user input for each test case, and their values will be used to update `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` accordingly.
Code of the loop:
for c in custos:
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custos` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in the list `custos`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custos` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in the list `custos`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custos` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in the list `custos`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
