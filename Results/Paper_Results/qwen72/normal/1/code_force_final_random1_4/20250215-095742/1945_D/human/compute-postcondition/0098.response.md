The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `c` and the number of cases. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1, and `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed), `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the smaller values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `v` exists, `best` remains 10^12.**
