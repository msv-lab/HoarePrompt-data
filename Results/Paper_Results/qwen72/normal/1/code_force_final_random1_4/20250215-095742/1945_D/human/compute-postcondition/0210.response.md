Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have completed, the list `custos` will contain the final cost values for each of the `x` test cases, with each value being the result of the cost calculation performed within the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `i` will retain their values as they were at the start of each iteration, but `i` will have reached the value `x-1` (the last index of the loop). The variable `custo` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will hold the final cost for the current test case at the end of each iteration. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` will be populated with the integer values from the input lists `a` and `b` for each test case, but these lists will be reinitialized for each new test case. The input variables `nf`, `a`, and `b` will be read from user input for each test case, and their values will be used to update `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` accordingly.**

This means that after the loop has executed all `x` iterations, the list `custos` will contain `x` elements, each representing the calculated cost for one of the test cases. The other variables will either be reset or retain their initial values as specified in the initial state, except for `i`, which will have iterated through all values from 0 to `x-1`.
