Output State: **`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `1` (or the last value it was set to before breaking out of the loop), `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, `custo` is appended to `custos`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The code `custos.append(custo)` appends the value of `custo` to the list `custos`.
- All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The value of `custo` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, but the exact value of `custo` is not provided in the initial state, so it is simply noted that `custo` is appended to `custos`.
