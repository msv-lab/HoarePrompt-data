### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input, including the number of test cases (`cases`), the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`), the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`), and the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjustments for 0-based Indexing**: The function adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization**: The function initializes `total` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost, and `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the allowed range.

4. **Loop Through Positions**: The function iterates through the positions from `na_frente` to 0 in reverse order. This is correct because Kirill can only move forward (i.e., to a lower index).

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`):
     - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
   - If the current position `v` is not within the allowed final position:
     - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

6. **Output**: After processing all positions, the function prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Correctness:
The logic of the function appears to be correct. It correctly handles the problem constraints and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the allowed range. The function also correctly processes multiple test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
