The only objects in the loop head are the list `custos` and the variable `c`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `custos`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` has at least 2 elements, and `c` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, and `c` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`custos` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in the list `custos`**
