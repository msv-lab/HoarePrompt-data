To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `y`, `max_p`, and the range parameters.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute:
- The starting value of the range (`max_p - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stop value (`0`).
- The step value is `-1`, indicating that the loop iterates backward.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once:
- `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.
- This implies that `max_p` must be greater than `0`.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `max_p` is greater than `0` and `y` is set to the starting value of the range, which is `max_p - 1`.

So, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.**
