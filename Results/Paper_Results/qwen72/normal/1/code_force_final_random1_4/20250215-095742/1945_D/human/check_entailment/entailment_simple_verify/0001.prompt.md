You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `cases` retain their initial values. The variable `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that the loop has run the number of times specified by `cases`. The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be one less than their initial values for each iteration, but since they are reset for each new test case, their final values depend on the last test case's inputs. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will retain the values provided by the user for each test case. The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, considering the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` will be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases (`cases`). For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`pos_final`).

2. **Adjusting Indices**: The function adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is done to convert the 1-based indices to 0-based indices, which is more natural in Python.

3. **Initialization**: It initializes `total` to 0, which will keep track of the total cost incurred by Kirill. It also initializes `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the allowed range.

4. **Iterating Backwards**: The function iterates over the positions from `na_frente` to 0 in reverse order. This is because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and moves forward.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`):
     - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
   - If the current position `v` is outside the allowed range:
     - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

6. **Output**: After processing all positions, it prints the value of `best`, which is the minimum cost to ensure Kirill is within the allowed range.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program seems to correctly handle the problem requirements. It iterates through the positions in reverse order, ensuring that Kirill can move to the front while minimizing the cost. The use of `best` to track the minimum cost and the adjustment of indices are appropriate.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic where the program might not always find the optimal solution. Specifically, the way the program updates `best` and `total` might not always consider all possible paths to the target position. 

To ensure correctness, the program should consider all possible paths and their costs, which might require a more dynamic programming approach or a priority queue to explore all options efficiently.

Given the constraints and the problem's nature, the current approach might not be optimal, but it does follow the basic logic required.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False**

The program might not always find the optimal solution due to the way it updates `best` and `total`. A more comprehensive approach, such as dynamic programming, would be necessary to ensure correctness in all cases.
