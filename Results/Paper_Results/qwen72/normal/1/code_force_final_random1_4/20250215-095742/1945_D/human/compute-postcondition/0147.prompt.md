You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1

        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `cases` retain their initial values. The variable `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that the loop has run the number of times specified by `cases`. The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be one less than their initial values for each iteration, but since they are reset for each new test case, their final values depend on the last test case's inputs. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will retain the values provided by the user for each test case. The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, considering the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` will be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
