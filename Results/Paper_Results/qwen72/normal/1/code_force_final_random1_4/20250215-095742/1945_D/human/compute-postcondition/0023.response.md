The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the variable `total`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `total` was initially 0.
- `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is a specific value from the list `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`.
- After the addition, `total` will be equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
