Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the first element in the list `b` that was processed by the loop (which is the element at index `max_p`), `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop plus `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `a_values[0]` is included in the calculation of `custo`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop plus `a_values[y]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then: if `y` (which is `max_p - 2`) equals 1, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[max_p - 2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then: if `y` (which is `max_p - 3`) equals 1, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[max_p - 3] + a_values[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 3]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
