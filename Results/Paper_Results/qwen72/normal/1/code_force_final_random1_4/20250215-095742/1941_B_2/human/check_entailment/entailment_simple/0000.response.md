Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation multiple times. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Operation Impact**: Each operation decreases the sum of the array by 4. Therefore, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero.
2. **Edge Elements**: The first and last elements of the array cannot be part of the operation since they do not have both neighbors. Thus, they must be handled separately.
3. **Parity Check**: The parity (odd/even nature) of the first and last elements is crucial because the operation always decreases elements by even numbers. If the first or last element is odd and cannot be balanced by the adjacent elements, it's impossible to make them zero.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Condition Check**: The program checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. This condition ensures that the edge elements can be balanced by their neighbors.
- **Output**: Based on the condition, the program prints "NO" if the condition is met, otherwise "YES".

However, the program is missing a crucial check: the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4. Without this check, the program might incorrectly determine that an array can be made zero when it cannot.

### Conclusion:
The given program is **incomplete** because it does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4. This is a necessary condition for the array to be reducible to all zeros.

Correctness: **False**
