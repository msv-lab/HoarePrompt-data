Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `numTest` is equal to `t`.
3. `_` is 0.
4. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
5. `a` is a list of integers from the input.
6. `i` is `n - 3`.
7. `opNum` is `a[n-3]`.
8. `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0.
9. `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
10. `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
11. If `stop` is True, at least one `a[i]` (where \(0 \leq i < n-2\)) is less than 0, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.
12. Additionally, `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the state of the list `a`:

- `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are all set to 0.
- `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
- `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.

Since `a[n-3]` is 0 (as per the condition `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0), the updates to `a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]` do not change their values:
- `a[n-2]` remains `a[n-2]` because `2 * a[n-3]` is 0.
- `a[n-1]` remains `a[n-1]` because `a[n-3]` is 0.

Additionally, it is stated that `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0. This means:
- `a[n-1]` is 0.
- `a[n-2]` is 0.

Given that `a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]` are both 0, and `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are also 0, the entire list `a` consists of zeros.

The condition `if stop is True` checks if any element in `a[0]` through `a[n-2]` is less than 0. Since all elements are 0, this condition will never be true, and the program will not skip the rest of the current iteration.

Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will execute without any conditions preventing it.

Output: **YES**
