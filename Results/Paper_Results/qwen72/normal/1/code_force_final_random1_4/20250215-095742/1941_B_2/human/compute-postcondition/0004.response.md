Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The list `b` has a specific property: either the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the initial state does not affect the content of the `print` statement, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **NO**
