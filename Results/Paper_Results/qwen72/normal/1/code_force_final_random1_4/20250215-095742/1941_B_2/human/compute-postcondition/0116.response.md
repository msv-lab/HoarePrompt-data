Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is `t - 1`, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[n-3]`, `stop` is `True` because at least one `a[i]` is less than 0 during the loop execution.**
