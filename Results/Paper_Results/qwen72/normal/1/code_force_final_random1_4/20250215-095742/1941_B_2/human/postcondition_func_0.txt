The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the list is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the list is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES". The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, with each list containing between 3 and 200,000 integers, and the sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 200,000.
