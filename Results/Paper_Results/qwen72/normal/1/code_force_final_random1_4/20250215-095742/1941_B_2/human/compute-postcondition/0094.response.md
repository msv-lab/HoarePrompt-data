The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `numTest` is `t - 1`
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3
- `a` is now a list of integers from the new input
- `i` is 0
- `opNum` is `a[0]`
- `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0
- `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`
- `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`
- `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`
- `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`
- `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`
- If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - opNum`

Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is `t - 1`, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 0, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`, `stop` remains False unless `a[0]` is less than 0.**
