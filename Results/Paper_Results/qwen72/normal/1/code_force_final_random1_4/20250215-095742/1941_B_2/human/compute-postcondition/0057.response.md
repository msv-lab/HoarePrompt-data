To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `numTest` is equal to `t`.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `opNum` is `a[0]`.
   - `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0.
   - `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
   - `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
   - `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`.
   - `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.
   - `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`.
   - `stop` is False.
   - If `stop` is True, at least one `a[i]` (where \(0 \leq i < n-2\)) is less than 0, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
   - If `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the program continues with the next statements in the loop.
   - Otherwise, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0, the program also continues with the next statements in the loop.
   - If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('NO')` statement is executed unconditionally based on the given code snippet.
   - The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always print 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
