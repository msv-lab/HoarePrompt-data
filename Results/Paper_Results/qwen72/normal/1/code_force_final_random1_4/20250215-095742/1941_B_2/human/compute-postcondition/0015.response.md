Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of integers based on the input provided. The condition specified in the if part or else part remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns the value of `a` to the integer input provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
- The condition specified in the if part or else part remains unchanged because the code snippet does not affect the elements of the list `b` or the values of `t` and `n`.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a` and retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `b`.
