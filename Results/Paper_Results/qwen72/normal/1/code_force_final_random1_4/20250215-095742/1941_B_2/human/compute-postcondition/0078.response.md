Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2`. If `stop` is True, there exists at least one `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) that is less than 0. Additionally, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0.**
