Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Card Placement**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `L` to keep track of the number of cards placed in each step.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly calculate the number of cards to be placed in the current step (`m = (n + 1) // 2`) and updates `n` by subtracting `m`.
   - This process continues until `n` becomes 0 or negative, ensuring that all cards are accounted for.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates over the list `L` to find the step where the k-th card is placed.
   - For each step, it checks if the k-th card falls within the current range (`if tot < k and k <= tot + a`).
   - If the condition is met, it prints the value of the k-th card, which is calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - It then updates `tot` and `pow` for the next iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the k-th card for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `n` correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
