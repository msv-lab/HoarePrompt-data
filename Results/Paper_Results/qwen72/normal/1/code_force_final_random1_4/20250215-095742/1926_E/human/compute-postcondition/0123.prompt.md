You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `_` is a placeholder indicating the total number of test cases processed, `n` and `k` are the final input values for the last test case, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions. For each test case where `k > (n + 1) // 2`, `s` will be `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` will be the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` will be the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` will be the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times, `p` will be `i`, `g` will be the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` will be `k - g`, and `y` will be calculated as `2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50,000), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case, though the specific type of result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
