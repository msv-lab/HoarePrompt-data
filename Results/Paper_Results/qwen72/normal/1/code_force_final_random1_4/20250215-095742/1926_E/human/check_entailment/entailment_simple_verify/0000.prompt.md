You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: After all iterations, `_` is a placeholder indicating the total number of test cases processed, `n` and `k` are the final input values for the last test case, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions. For each test case where `k > (n + 1) // 2`, `s` will be `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` will be the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` will be the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` will be the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times, `p` will be `i`, `g` will be the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` will be `k - g`, and `y` will be calculated as `2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly `(n + 1) // 2`. According to the problem description, the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards laid down are the odd-numbered cards in ascending order. However, the program incorrectly handles this boundary condition. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the correct output should be `7` (the last odd-numbered card), but the program will incorrectly output `1`.

To illustrate this further, consider the following input:
```
1
7 4
```
The expected output is `7`, but the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. This is because the program's logic for handling the transition between laying down odd-numbered cards and the next set of cards (twice an odd number) is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if k > (n + 1) // 2:` does not correctly account for the boundary case where `k` is exactly `(n + 1) // 2`.
