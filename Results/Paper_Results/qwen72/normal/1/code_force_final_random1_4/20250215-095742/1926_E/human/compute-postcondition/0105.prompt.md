Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing all the values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, tot is 0, pow is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing at least one value of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, tot is a + the previous value of tot, pow is 2, a is the first element in L. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing at least two values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, pow is 4, a is the second element in L, tot is updated to tot + a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the last computed value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing at least three values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop, `pow` is 8, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `tot + a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
