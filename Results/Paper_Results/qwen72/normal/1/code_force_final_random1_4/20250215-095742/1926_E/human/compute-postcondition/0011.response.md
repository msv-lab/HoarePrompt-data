Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The list `L` initially contains the value `(n + 1) // 2`. After executing `L.append(m)`, the list `L` now contains two elements, both of which are `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged.
