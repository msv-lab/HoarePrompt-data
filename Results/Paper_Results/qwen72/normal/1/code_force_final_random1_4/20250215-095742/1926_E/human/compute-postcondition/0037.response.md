The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `m`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` remains unchanged, `L` remains unchanged, `tot` remains unchanged, `pow` remains unchanged.**
