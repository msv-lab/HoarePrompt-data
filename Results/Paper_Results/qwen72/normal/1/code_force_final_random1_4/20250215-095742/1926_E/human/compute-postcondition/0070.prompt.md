Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is as follows: `_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration and must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the current value of `tot` is `a` and `k` is less than or equal to `a + a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration and must have at least two elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the current value of `tot` is `a + a` and `k` is less than or equal to `a + a + a`. Otherwise, the values of `tot`, `k`, `a`, `m`, `L`, `n`, and `t` remain as they were before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration and must have at least three elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `a + a + a`, `pow` is 8. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the current value of `tot` is `a + a + a` and `k` is less than or equal to `a + a + a + a`. Otherwise, the values of `tot`, `k`, `a`, `m`, `L`, `n`, and `t` remain as they were before the if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
