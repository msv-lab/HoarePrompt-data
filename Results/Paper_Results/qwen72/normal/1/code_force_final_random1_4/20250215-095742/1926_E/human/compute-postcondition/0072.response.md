The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This updates the value of `n` and introduces a new value for `k`.

- `n` is now the first integer from the input.
- `k` is now the second integer from the input.

The other variables (`_`, `t`, `m`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\)**.
