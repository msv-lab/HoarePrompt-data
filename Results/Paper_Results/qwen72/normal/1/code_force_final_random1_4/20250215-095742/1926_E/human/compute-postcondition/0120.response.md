Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 50,000, `_` is a placeholder, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is now `2`. If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, then `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.***
