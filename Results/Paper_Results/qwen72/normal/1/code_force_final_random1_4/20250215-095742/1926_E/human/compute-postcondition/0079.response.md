Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now \(n - (n + 1) // 2\) and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\) (after the update of `n`), `L` is a list containing the value of `m` (before the update of `n`), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\), where `n` has already been updated to \(n - (n + 1) // 2\) and must be greater than 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
