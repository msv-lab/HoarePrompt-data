Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration and must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, and the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.**
