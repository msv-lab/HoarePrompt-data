The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (non-zero for integers), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` remains unchanged, `L` is an empty list, `tot` remains unchanged, `pow` remains unchanged**
