The code snippet `m = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Given the initial state, `m` was already set to `(n + 1) // 2`, so this assignment does not change the value of `m`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
