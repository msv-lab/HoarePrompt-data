The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `L` is an empty list, `tot` remains unchanged, `pow` remains unchanged.**
