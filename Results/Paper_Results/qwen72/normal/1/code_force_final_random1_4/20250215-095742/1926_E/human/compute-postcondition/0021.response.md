To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `pow` is 1.
   - The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

2. **Relevant Variables:**
   - `pow` is 1.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a value such that \(k \leq tot + a\).

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Since `pow` is 1, the expression simplifies to \(2 * (k - tot) - 1\).
   - Given that `tot` is 0, the expression further simplifies to \(2 * k - 1\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of \(2 * k - 1\).

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
