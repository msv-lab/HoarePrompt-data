The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (non-zero and positive), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is the first input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) (which is 1)**
