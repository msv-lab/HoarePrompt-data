Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is -1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values `-1`, `-1`, and `-1`, `m` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is `-1` when `n` is `-1`. The list `L` initially contains two elements, both `-1`. After appending `m` (which is also `-1`) to `L`, the list `L` now contains three elements, all `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
