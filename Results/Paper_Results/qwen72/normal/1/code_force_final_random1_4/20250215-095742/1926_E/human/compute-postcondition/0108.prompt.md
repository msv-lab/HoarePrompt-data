You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `_` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial value. For each iteration, the variables `n` and `k` are reset based on the input provided for that specific test case. The variable `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive for the last test case. The list `L` contains the values of \((n + 1) // 2\) computed during each iteration of the inner while loop for the last test case. The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for the last test case. The variable `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) for the last test case. If the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` is met for any `a` in `L` during the last test case, the corresponding output was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
