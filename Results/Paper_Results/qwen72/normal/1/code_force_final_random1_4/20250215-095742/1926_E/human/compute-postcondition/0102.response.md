Postcondition: ***_ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing at least three values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, pow is 4, a is the third element in L. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `tot` is updated to `tot + a`. Otherwise, `tot` remains unchanged.***
