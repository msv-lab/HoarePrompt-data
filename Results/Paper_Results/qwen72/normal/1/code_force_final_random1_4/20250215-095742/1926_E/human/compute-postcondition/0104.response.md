Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the last computed value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing at least three values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop, `pow` is 8, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `tot + a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pow` is multiplied by 2, changing from 4 to 8.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
