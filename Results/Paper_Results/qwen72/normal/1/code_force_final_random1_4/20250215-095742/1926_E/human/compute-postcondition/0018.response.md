Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values of the sequence of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.** 

The variable `pow` is initialized to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
