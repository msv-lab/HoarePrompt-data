The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts at least two parameters, `n` and `k`, and possibly a third parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each test case involves integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and there can be up to 50,000 test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50,000).

Since the output is not specified, I will assume that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each case. The exact nature of the processing is not detailed, but typically such functions would return some computed value or a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50,000), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case, though the specific type of result is not specified.**
