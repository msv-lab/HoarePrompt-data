Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    score = 0
    for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
        score += l[i]
    print(score)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, n is an input integer greater than 0, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of l, i is 2 * n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, n is a new input integer greater than 0, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of l, i is 2 * n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, n is a new input integer greater than 1, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is the sum of every second element in l starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than 2 * n, i is 2 * n - 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
