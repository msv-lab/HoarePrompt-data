Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 2.** 

Explanation: The variable `score` was initially set to the first element of the list `l`. After executing the code snippet `score += l[i]`, `score` is updated to the sum of the first element and the third element of `l` (since `i` is 2). The other variables remain unchanged.
