You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: _ is t-1, n is a new input integer greater than 0, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is the sum of every second element in l starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than 2 * n, i is 2 * n - 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two numbers from the list, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing both numbers. This process is repeated `n` times until all numbers are removed.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order.
   - It initializes a variable `score` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adds it to the score. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will always be paired with the next smallest elements, ensuring that the minimum values are added to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is optimal for maximizing the score.
   - **Pairing**: By taking every second element starting from the first, the program ensures that the minimum value in each pair is added to the score. This is the optimal strategy because the smallest elements will always contribute the most to the score when paired with the next smallest elements.
   - **Loop**: The loop runs `n` times, which is correct since we need to perform the operation `n` times, and each iteration processes two elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly by simply adding the smallest element to the score.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` correctly by summing up the appropriate elements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
