The value of `score` is incremented by the value of the first element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, the exact value added to `score` depends on the first element of `l`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 0**
