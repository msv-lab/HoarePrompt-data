To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the expression `2 * n`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the stop value (`2 * n`) is greater than the start value (0). This means `2 * n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `_` is 2 (irrelevant to the loop).
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input (irrelevant to the loop).
   - `score` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop).
   - `i` is 2 * n - 2 (irrelevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is already stated to be greater than 1, `2 * n` will always be greater than 0, ensuring the loop will execute.
   - The variable `i` in the loop head will start from 0 and increment by 2 until it reaches but does not exceed `2 * n`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` will start from 0 as specified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is 0, `i` is 0**
