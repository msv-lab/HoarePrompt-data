The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`, and the expression `2 * n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each time it runs, starting from 0 and continuing as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, and `2 * n` is greater than 2 (since `n > 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2, making it 2, and `2 * n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 2**
