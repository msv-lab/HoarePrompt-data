The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and it is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means that the loop will execute a number of times specified by the new input integer provided by the user. The state of `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented to 2, and the new input integer `n` must still be greater than 0 to ensure there are more iterations left.

However, since the loop's continuation is solely dependent on the input provided to the `range` function, and this input is not modified within the loop, the actual number of iterations is determined before the loop starts. Therefore, if the loop has already run once, the input must have been at least 1, and for it to run again, the input must have been at least 2.

Given that the loop's execution is based on a new input integer, and assuming the same input is used for simplicity (since the problem does not specify how the input changes), the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of `l`, `i` is 2 * n - 2**
