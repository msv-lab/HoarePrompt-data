The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is 4, the fifth element of `l` (since indexing starts at 0) is added to `score`.

- Initial `score` is the sum of the first and third elements of `l`.
- After executing the code, `score` is now the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 2.**
