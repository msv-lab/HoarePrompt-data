Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of the new `l`, `i` is 2 * n - 2.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
- The code snippet `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` updates `l` to a new sorted list of integers from user input.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `score`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `score` is still calculated as the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of the new `l`.
- `i` remains 2 * n - 2.
