The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `2 * n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (so `i` becomes 4), and `2 * n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop condition to hold true. Since `n` is greater than 1, `2 * n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 4, `2 * n` must be greater than 4**
