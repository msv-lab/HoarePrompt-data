Output State: **_ is 0, n is an input integer greater than 0, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of l, i is 2 * n - 2.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `score` will hold the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element and ending at the (2 * n - 2)th element. The variable `i` will be equal to 2 * n - 2, which is the last index accessed in the loop. The other variables (`_`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
