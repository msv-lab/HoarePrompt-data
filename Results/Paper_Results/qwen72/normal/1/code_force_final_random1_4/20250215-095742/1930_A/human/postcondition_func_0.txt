The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the smaller number in each pair of consecutive numbers from the sorted list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed scores for each test case.
