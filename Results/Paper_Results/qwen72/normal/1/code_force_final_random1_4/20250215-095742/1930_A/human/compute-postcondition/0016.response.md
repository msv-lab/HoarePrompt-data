The code snippet resets the value of `score` to 0. This affects the value of `score` which was previously calculated as the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is 0, `i` is 2 * n - 2.**
