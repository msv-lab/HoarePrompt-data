Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of integers. Sorting is crucial because it ensures that when we take pairs of consecutive elements, the smaller element in each pair is always the first element of the pair.
3. **Calculating the Score**: The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first element (index 0). This is because, in a sorted list, the smaller element of each pair will always be at an even index (0, 2, 4, ...).
4. **Summing the Scores**: The program sums these smaller elements to get the maximum possible score.
5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

This approach guarantees that the score is maximized because the smallest elements are always chosen first, ensuring that the minimum values are added to the score in each step.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
