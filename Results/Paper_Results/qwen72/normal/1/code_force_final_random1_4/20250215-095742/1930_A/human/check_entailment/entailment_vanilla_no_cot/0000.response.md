Correctness: **True**

The provided solution works correctly for the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that when we take pairs of elements, the smaller element in each pair is always considered first, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

2. **Summing the Minimum Elements**: By iterating through the sorted list and summing every other element starting from the first, we effectively sum the minimum elements of each pair. This is because in a sorted list, the first element of each pair (i.e., `l[i]` where `i` is even) is always the smaller one.

3. **Correct Output**: The program prints the score for each test case, which is the sum of the minimum elements of the pairs formed from the sorted list.

This approach guarantees that the score is maximized, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
