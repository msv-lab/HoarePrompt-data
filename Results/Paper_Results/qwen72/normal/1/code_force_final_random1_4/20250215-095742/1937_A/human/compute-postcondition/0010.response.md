The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` is the log2 of the input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer and must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**
