Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the logarithm base 2 of some input integer and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1.
- `power` is initially set to `n + 1`.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n` and `power`:**
   - `n` is the logarithm base 2 of some input integer. This means if the input integer is \( x \), then \( n = \log_2(x) \).
   - `power` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - However, the current value of `power` is given as `n`.

2. **Conflicting Values of `power`:**
   - There seems to be a contradiction in the initial state. It states that `power` is initially `n + 1` but then says the current value of `power` is `n`.
   - For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume the current value of `power` is `n` as stated in the final part of the initial state.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Since `power` is currently `n`, the expression `2 ** power` simplifies to `2 ** n`.

4. **Interpreting the Result:**
   - Given that `n = \log_2(x)`, the expression `2 ** n` is equivalent to \( 2^{\log_2(x)} \).
   - By the properties of logarithms, \( 2^{\log_2(x)} = x \).

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of the input integer \( x \).

Output: **x (where x is the input integer whose logarithm base 2 is n)**
