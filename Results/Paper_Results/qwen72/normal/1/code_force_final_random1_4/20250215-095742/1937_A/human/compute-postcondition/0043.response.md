The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- `n` is an input integer

None of these variables (`i`, `n_cases`, `n`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
