Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description provided. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases and the integer n for each test case. A corrected function definition might look like: `def find_position_of_one(t, n_list):`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n_list` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the arrays a for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). `n_cases` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        n = log2(n)
        while power < n:
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `n` is the log2 of the input integer and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is the new input integer. If `n` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\), `n` is set to `log2(n_cases)`, and `power` is either `n` or `n - 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
