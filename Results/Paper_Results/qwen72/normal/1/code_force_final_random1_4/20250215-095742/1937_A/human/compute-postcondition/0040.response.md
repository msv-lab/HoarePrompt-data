Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is the new input integer. If `n` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`.***
