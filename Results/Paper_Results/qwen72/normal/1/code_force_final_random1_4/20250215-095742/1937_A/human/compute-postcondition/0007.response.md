The value of `n` is updated to the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer and is not equal to 1, the new value of `n` will be the logarithm (base 2) of the original `n`. The other variables (`i`, `n_cases`, and `power`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer, `power` is 1.**
