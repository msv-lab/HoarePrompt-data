Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `n` is the log2 of the input integer and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`.***
