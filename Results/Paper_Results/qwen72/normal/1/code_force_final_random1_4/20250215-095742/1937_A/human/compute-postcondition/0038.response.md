Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1.
- `power` is `n`.
- `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `power`**:
   - According to the initial state, `power` is equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, `power = n`.

2. **Condition on `n`**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1.
   - Since `power = n`, this condition simplifies to `n >= n - 1`, which is always true.

3. **Condition on `power`**:
   - `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.
   - Since `power = n`, this condition simplifies to `n != n + 1`, which is always true.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Since `power = n`, the print statement will print `2 ** n`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2 ** n (where n is the value of n)**
