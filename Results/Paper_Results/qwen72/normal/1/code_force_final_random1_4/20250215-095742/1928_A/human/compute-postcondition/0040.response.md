The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement because they are not used within it.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`).
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- `a1` is `a // 2`.
- `a2` is `a // 2`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
