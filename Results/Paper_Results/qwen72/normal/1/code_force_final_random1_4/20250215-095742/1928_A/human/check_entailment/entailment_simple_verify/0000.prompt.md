You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were read from the input, and based on the conditions in the loop, the program printed 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. After the loop completes, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the ones from the last iteration, but these values are not retained for further use outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic within the conditions is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **First Condition (`if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if both dimensions `a` and `b` are even. However, this is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles and reformed into a 1x4 rectangle, but the program would incorrectly output "yes" for a 4x4 rectangle, which cannot be reformed into a different rectangle.

2. **Second Condition (`elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`)**:
   - This condition is logically incorrect. It checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, which is always false because it compares tuples. This condition should be simplified to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but even then, it is not the correct approach to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

3. **Third Condition (`elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, this is not a valid criterion for determining if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and reformed into a 1x6 rectangle, but the program would incorrectly output "yes" for a 3x1 rectangle, which cannot be reformed into a different rectangle.

4. **Else Condition**:
   - The else condition outputs "no" for all other cases, which is not always correct. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles and reformed into a 1x8 rectangle, but the program would incorrectly output "no".

A correct approach would involve checking if either dimension is greater than 1 and if the product of the dimensions is greater than the maximum possible dimension after cutting. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a > 1 and b > 1:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This corrected function correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description.
