Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is 2.
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'yes'` to the console. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **yes**
