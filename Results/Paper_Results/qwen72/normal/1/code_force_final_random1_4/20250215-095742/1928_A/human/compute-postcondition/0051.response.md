Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If either `a` or `b` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2` if `a` is even, and `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2` if `b` is even. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.***
