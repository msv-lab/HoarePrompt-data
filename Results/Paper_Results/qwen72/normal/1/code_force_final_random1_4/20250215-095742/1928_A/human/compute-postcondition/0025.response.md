Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 2. The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the new values provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input within the range 1 to 10^9, and `i` is 2.
- The code snippet `a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- After executing this code, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input.
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions mentioned in the initial state about the values of `a` and `b` (whether they are even, or the conditions involving their differences) are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
