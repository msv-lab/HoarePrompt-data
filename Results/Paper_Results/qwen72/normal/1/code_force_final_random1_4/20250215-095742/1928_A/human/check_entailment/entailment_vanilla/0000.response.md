### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if Bob can form another rectangle:
     - **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. It checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, which is not a valid logical check. It should be simplified to check if `a` or `b` is 1.
     - **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it does not correctly handle all cases where Bob can form another rectangle.
     - **Else:** `else`
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.
   - Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions for forming another rectangle. The corrected program checks if either dimension is 1 and prints 'no' in that case, otherwise it prints 'yes'.

Correctness: **False**
