Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is also set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.***
