Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). Specifically, the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` do not correctly capture the necessary conditions for the robot to get stuck or fail to reach the target.

A correct approach should consider the following:
- The robot must be able to move from the first row to the second row at some point.
- Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the end of the grid without getting stuck.

The provided code does not correctly handle these conditions, leading to incorrect results in some cases. For example, it fails to correctly handle the case where the robot can move between rows but gets stuck due to the direction of the arrows.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row
        can_move_to_second_row = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == '<' and b[i] == '>':
                can_move_to_second_row = True
                break
        
        # Check if the robot can reach the end of the second row
        can_reach_end = True
        for i in range(n-1):
            if b[i] == '<' and b[i+1] == '<':
                can_reach_end = False
                break
        
        if can_move_to_second_row and can_reach_end:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and if it can then move to the end of the second row without getting stuck. This should correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
