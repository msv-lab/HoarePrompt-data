#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length n, consisting only of '<' and '>', representing the directions of arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` was an input integer, `a` and `b` were input strings. The loop counter `_` has incremented from 0 to `t-1`. For each test case, the loop has checked all odd indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even). If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. Otherwise, it printed 'Yes' after completing all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>'. The function checks if, for any odd index `i` in the range [1, n-1], the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` hold. If any such condition is met, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such condition is met for all odd indices, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes.
