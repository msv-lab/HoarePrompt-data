The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3 (since starting from 1 and incrementing by 2, the next value would be 3). The loop counter `_` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0**
