Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, and either (i + 1 is less than n and the character at index i in `a` is '<', and the character at index i + 1 in `b` is '<') or (the character at index i in `a` is '<', and the character at index i - 1 in `b` is '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
