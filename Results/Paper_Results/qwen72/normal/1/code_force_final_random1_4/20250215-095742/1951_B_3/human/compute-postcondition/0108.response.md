Postcondition: ***`s` contains at least one element, `i` is the first element in `s`, and `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and if `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.***
