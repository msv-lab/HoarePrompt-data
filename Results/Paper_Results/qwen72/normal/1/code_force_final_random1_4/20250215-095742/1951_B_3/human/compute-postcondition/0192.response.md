Postcondition: ***`i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), and the list `s` must still contain at least one element. If `i` == `h`, then if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, and `z` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` != `h`, and `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
