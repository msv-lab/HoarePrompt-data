Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s[p]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), `h` is the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `j` is `n-2`, `p` is `n-2`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, and all other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`). If `i` is equal to `h`, and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *If the loop is iterating in forward order, `i` is the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`). The list `s` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue. If `i` == `h`, and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` > `h`, the loop breaks. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is not 1, `i` remains the second-to-last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-2]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), and the list `s` must still contain at least one element. If `i` == `h`, then if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, and `z` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` != `h`, and `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
