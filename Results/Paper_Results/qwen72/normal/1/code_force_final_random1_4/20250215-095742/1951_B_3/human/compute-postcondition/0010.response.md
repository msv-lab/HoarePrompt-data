Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is an empty list if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is a list containing `[i]`, `c` is 0 if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 1, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `c` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
