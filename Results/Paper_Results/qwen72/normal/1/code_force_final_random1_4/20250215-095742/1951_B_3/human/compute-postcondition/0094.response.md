Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `j` is the index of `i` in `s` (starting from 0), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to `i` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `ans1` is 0, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[p]` before the swap, and `z` is 0.**
