Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `c` is 2, `i` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `n` remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 14, then `x` is specifically equal to `a[14]`. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, the length of `ind` is exactly 1, and the first element of `ind` is not 0.***
