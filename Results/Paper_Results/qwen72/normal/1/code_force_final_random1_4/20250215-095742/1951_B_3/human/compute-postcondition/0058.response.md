Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) is now the original `s[p]`, the `p`th element of `s` (s[p]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, `h` is the original `s[k-1]`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is equal to `j`, `z` is 1 if `i` == `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
