The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The initial state specifies that `s` has at least 4 elements and `i` is the third element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[3]`). These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` has at least 4 elements, `i` is the third element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[3]`), `j` is increased by 1.**
