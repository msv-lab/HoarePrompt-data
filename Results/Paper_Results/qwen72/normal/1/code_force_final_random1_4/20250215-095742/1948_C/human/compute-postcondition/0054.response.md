Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. Since the loop did not break, it prints 'Yes' after completing all iterations.**
