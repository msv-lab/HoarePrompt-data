### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 2xN grid with arrows pointing left (`<`) or right (`>`).
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, N).
   - The robot moves every second: first, it moves left, right, up, or down, and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, N).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.
   - It then iterates through the grid in steps of 2, checking specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Key Logic:**
   - The program checks if there is a way to move from the first row to the second row and vice versa without getting stuck.
   - Specifically, it checks if there is a `<` in the first row and a `<` in the second row at positions that would block the robot's path.

4. **Conditions Checked:**
   - The loop iterates over odd indices `i` (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - It checks if `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a blocking condition, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `print('No')` instead of `print('NO')` and `print('yes')` instead of `print('YES')`. However, the problem statement mentions that the output can be in any case, so this is not an issue.
   - The logic seems to correctly identify if the robot can get stuck in a way that prevents it from reaching the target cell.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell based on the given conditions.
