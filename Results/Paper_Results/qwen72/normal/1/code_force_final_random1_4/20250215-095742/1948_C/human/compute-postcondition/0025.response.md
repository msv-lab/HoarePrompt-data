Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- The loop counter `_` is 0.
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true.

### Analysis:
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` implies that there is a specific pattern in the strings `a` and `b` where certain characters match the '<' character in a specific way.
- The print statement `print('No')` is independent of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_`. It simply prints the string 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always print the string 'No', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_`.

Output: **No**
