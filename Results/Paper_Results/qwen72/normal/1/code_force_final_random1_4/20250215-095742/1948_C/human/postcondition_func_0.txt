The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>'. The function checks if, for any odd index `i` in the range [1, n-1], the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` hold. If any such condition is met, it prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such condition is met for all odd indices, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes.
