Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- The loop counter `_` remains 0.
- The condition is that either:
  - (i + 1 < n and the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is '<')
  - or (the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is '<').

Given this precondition, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
