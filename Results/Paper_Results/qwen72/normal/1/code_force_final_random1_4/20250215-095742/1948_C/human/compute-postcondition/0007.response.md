Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is 1.
- The conditions are either:
  - (i + 1 is less than n and the character at index i in `a` is '<', and the character at index i + 1 in `b` is '<')
  - (the character at index i in `a` is '<', and the character at index i - 1 in `b` is '<')

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
