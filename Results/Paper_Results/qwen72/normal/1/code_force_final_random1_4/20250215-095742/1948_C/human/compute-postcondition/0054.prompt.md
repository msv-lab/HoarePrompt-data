Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, `n` is updated to a new input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and the loop counter `_` remains 0. If `i + 1 < n` and the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is '<', or if the character at index `i` in `a` is '<' and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is '<', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, and `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 6, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, and `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as usual.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
