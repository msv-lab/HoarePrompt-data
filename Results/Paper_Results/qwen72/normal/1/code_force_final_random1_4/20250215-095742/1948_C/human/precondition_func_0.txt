t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length n, consisting only of '<' and '>', representing the directions of arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
