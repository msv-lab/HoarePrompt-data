Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length `n`, consisting only of '<' and '>', representing the directions of arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even. If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0. The loop has completed all iterations, meaning that for every odd index `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the conditions `i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` were never met. Therefore, the program prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` remains 0, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. Since the loop did not break, it prints 'Yes' after completing all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
