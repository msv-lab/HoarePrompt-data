Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1. If `i + 1 < n` and either (`a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`) or (`a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`), the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.***
