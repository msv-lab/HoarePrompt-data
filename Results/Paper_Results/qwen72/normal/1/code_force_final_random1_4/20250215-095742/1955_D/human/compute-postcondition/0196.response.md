Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 1 if `a[1]` is not in `b_values` or if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is less than 0 after decrementing, otherwise `curr` is 3. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is less than 0, `curr` remains 0 if `a[1]` is not in `b_values` or if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is less than 0 after decrementing, otherwise `curr` is 2.***
