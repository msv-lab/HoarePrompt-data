Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
