The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr` was 1 (since `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1 and it is greater than or equal to 0, making `curr` initially 1). Therefore, `curr` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 2.**
