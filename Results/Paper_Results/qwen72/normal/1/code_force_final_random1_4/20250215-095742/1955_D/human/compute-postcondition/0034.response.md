Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
