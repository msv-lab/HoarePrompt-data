Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, the values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[2]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0 after incrementing, otherwise `curr` remains the same, `ans` remains 0 unless `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is set to 2.**
