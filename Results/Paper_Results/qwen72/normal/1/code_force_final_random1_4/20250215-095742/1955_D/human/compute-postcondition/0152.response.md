Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m`, `a[i + m]` is decremented by 1 in `cnt_b`. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1.
- Since `i` is 2, `i + m` is `2 + m`.
- The value of `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decremented by 1.
- The rest of the conditions and values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
