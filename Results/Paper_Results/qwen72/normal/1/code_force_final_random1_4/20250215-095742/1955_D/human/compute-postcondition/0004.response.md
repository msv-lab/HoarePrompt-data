The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer
- `k` is an integer

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` will contain a list of integers derived from the user input. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
