Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m`, and `a[i + m]` is decremented by 1 in `cnt_b`. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `curr` is increased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.***
