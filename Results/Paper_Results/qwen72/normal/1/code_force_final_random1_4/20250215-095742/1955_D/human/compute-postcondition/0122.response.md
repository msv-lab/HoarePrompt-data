The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `a[0]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of list `a` is accessed, and its corresponding value in `cnt_b` is incremented.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, the element at index 0 of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, and the count of the element at index 0 of list `a` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.**
