Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the next (third) element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` does not change the value of `cnt_b[i]` because it was already 0 according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
