The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns each part to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t` for the loop to execute.

After executing the code:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers.
- The initial state of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer.**
