Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
