The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1**
