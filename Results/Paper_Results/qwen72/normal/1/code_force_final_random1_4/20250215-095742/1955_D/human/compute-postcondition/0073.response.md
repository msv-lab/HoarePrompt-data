Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `2m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m + 1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b` and `curr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and constraints specified in the initial state (such as `n` being greater than `2m`, `m` being greater than 0, etc.) continue to hold true.
