The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the element in the list `cnt_b` at the index `i`. Given that `i` is `n - m` and `n` is greater than `m`, the index `i` is a positive integer. The list `cnt_b` must be large enough to accommodate the index `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - m`, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable, `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.**
