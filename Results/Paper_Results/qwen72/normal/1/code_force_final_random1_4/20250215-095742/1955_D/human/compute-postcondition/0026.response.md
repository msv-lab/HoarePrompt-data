Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is `cnt_b[a[1]] - 1`. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.***
