The value of `cnt_b[i]` is set to 0. The initial state specifies that `b_values` must contain at least one element, and `i` is an element from `b_values`. The other elements in `cnt_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
