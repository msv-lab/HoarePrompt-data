Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, the values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0 after incrementing, `curr` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `curr` remains the same. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 2; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[2]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` remains unchanged, and `curr` remains the same, and `ans` remains 0. `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decremented by 1.**
