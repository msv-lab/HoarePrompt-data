Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `a` from index 0 to `m-1`.
- For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, if it is present in the set `b_values` (which contains unique elements from the list `b`), the corresponding count in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1.
- If the count in `cnt_b` for `a[i]` is still non-negative after decrementing, the variable `curr` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `m-1` (the last index of the list `a`).
- The variable `curr` will hold the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
