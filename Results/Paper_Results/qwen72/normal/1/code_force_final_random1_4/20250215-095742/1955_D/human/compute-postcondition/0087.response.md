Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, the loop will execute one more time if the current iteration count is less than the input value. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the new input.**
