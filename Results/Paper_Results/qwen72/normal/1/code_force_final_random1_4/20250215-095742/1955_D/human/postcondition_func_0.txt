The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. It calculates and prints the number of subarrays of `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` elements present in `b`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the counters for elements in `b` are reset to zero.
