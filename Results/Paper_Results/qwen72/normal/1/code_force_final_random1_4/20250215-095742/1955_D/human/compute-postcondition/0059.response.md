Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `2m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The new value of `curr` is `curr + 1`.
- The condition for `ans` (whether `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`) is still valid, but the value of `curr` has been updated.
