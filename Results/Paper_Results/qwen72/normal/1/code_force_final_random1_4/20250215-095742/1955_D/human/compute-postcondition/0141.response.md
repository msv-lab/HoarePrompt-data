The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than `m`
- If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1
- If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `i + m` is calculated as `1 + m`.
2. `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, or `curr`, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.**
