Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - m`, `n` is greater than `m`. The loop has completed all its iterations. The final values of `cnt_b`, `curr`, and `ans` depend on the elements of `a` and `b` and their interactions as described in the loop. Specifically, `cnt_b` reflects the net count of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values`, adjusted by the loop operations. `curr` represents the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`. `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - m`, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable, `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable, `cnt_b[i]` is `0`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` must be an iterable with at least one more element, `cnt_b[i]` is `0`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
