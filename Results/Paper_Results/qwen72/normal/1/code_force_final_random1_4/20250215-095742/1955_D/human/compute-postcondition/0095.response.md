Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, for each index `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.**
