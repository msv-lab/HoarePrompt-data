The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, this means `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1. The other conditions (`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.**
