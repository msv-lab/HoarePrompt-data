Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, the values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`. The current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `curr` is incremented by 1, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
