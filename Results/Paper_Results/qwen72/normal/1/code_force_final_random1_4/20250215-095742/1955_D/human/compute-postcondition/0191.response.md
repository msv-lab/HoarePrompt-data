Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `curr` is 2. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.***
