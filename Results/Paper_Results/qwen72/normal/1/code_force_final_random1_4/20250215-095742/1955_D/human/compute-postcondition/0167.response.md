The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means that the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user. The only variable directly affected by this loop head is the loop control variable `_`, which is not used within the loop body (as indicated by the underscore `_`), and the input value that determines the number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- All elements in `b_values` have been processed.
- `cnt_b[i]` is `0` for each unique element `i` in `b_values`.
- `n` is greater than `m`.
- `i` is the last element in `b_values`.

Since the loop control variable `_` is not relevant to the state of the program and does not affect the state of other variables, and the input for the number of iterations is taken anew for each loop, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the outer loop would reset or remain as it was initialized before the loop started, assuming no changes were made to `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `n`, or `m` within the loop body.

However, since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head here only involves the loop control variable `_` and the input for the number of iterations, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is `0` for each unique element `i` in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, and `i` is the last element in `b_values`.** 

Note: The state remains unchanged because the loop head does not alter the state of `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `n`, or `m`. The loop control variable `_` is not part of the state that needs to be tracked for the purpose of this task.
