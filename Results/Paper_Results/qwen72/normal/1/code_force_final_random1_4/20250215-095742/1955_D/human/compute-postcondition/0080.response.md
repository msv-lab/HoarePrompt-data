Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the next element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since the initial state already specifies that `cnt_b[i]` is 0, the value of `cnt_b[i]` remains unchanged. The other conditions (`b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the next element from `b_values`) remain valid and unchanged.
