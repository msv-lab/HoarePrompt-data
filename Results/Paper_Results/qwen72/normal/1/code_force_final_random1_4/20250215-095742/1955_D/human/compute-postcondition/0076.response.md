To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print(ans)` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the context).
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `b` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is calculated as `n - m`.
   - `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
   - `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

2. **Logic:**
   - The variable `curr` is determined by counting how many elements in `a` are also in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - This process is repeated for each iteration (likely within a loop, though the loop itself is not shown in the snippet).

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The final value of `ans` depends on the number of iterations where `curr` meets the condition of being greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `k`, and the counts in `cnt_b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the total number of times the condition `curr >= k` was met during the iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times the condition `curr >= k` was met during the iterations)**
