Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, the values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 after incrementing, `curr` is increased by 1; otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` remains unchanged and `curr` remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` remains unchanged, and `curr` remains the same. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1 and then incremented by 1, making `ans` equal to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
