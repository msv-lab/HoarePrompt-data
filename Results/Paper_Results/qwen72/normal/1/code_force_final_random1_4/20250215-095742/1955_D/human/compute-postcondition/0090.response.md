The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `m`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 1), and `m` must still be greater than `i` (so `m` must be greater than 1).

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1**
