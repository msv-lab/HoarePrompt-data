Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `k` remains the same as the input integer, `a` and `b` lists remain unchanged, and `ans` contains the number of valid subarrays of `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` elements present in `b`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The `cnt_b` array has been reset to zero for all elements that were in the `b_values` set.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values provided as input.
- The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ans` now holds the count of subarrays of `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` elements that are also present in `b`.
- The loop has processed all possible subarrays of `a` of length `m`, and the final value of `ans` reflects the number of such subarrays that meet the criteria.
