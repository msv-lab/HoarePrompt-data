The only variable in the loop head is `i` in relation to `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= k`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1 and `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1. Since `i` starts at 1 and `k` is at least 1, the condition `i <= k` will always be true for the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0**
