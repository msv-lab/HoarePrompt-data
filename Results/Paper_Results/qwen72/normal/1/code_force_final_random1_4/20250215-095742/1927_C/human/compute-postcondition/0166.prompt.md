Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where each element a_i and b_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted as per the loop conditions, up to a maximum of `newk`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are ≤ `k` and also in `b` or ≤ `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are ≤ `k` and also in `a` or ≤ `newk`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were processed according to the loop conditions, and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were processed according to the loop conditions. The loop has completed all iterations up to `k`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the specific actions for the if part are taken. Otherwise, the specific actions for the else part are taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
