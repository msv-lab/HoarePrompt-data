Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `newk = k // 2` updates the value of `newk` to be the integer division of `k` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
