Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` (which is 4) is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` (which is 4) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
