Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is 0 or 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 or 1 and `bOnes` is 1 or 2.***
