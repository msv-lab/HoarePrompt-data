Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, with the conditions that `i` is 3 and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
