Postcondition: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. Additionally, `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
