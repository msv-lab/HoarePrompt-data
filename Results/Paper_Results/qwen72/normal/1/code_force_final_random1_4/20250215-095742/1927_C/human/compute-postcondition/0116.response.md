Output State: **`n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `bOnes = 0` sets the variable `bOnes` to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `aOnes`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
