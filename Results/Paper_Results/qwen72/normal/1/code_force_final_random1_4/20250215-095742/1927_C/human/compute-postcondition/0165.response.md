Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were processed according to the loop conditions, and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were processed according to the loop conditions. The loop has completed all iterations up to `k`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the specific actions for the if part are taken. Otherwise, the specific actions for the else part are taken.***
