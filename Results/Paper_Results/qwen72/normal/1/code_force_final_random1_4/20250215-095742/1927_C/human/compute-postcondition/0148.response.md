Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then either `aOnes` is incremented by 1 (if `aOnes < bOnes`) or `bOnes` is incremented by 1 (if `aOnes ≥ bOnes`). If `i` is in `a` but not in `b` and `aOnes ≤ newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a` and `bOnes ≤ newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
