Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, and if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `bOnes` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
