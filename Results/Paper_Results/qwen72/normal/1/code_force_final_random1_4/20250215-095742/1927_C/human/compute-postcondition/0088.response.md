Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `aOnes` is 0 or 1, `bOnes` is 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
