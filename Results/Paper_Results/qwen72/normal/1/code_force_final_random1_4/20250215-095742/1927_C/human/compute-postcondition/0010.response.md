Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is present in both lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, the number of ones in list `a` (`aOnes`) is less than the number of ones in list `b` (`bOnes`).**
