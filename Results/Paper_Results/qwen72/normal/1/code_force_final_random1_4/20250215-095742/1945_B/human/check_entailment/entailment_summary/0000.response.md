Reasoning:  
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The key issue lies in the condition and the formula used to calculate the result.

1. **Condition Check**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not correctly capturing the scenario where the visibility period of the fireworks overlaps significantly. This condition checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, which is not a necessary condition for determining the maximum overlap.

2. **Calculation of Overlap**: The calculation `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is incorrect because it assumes that the overlap happens only when `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. However, the overlap can occur even if `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`.

3. **Correct Approach**: To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`. The LCM will help us determine the points in time when both installations launch fireworks, and the visibility period will help us determine how long these fireworks are visible.

4. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:
   - Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
   - Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
   - Sum these values and add 1 if the LCM is less than or equal to the visibility period.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
