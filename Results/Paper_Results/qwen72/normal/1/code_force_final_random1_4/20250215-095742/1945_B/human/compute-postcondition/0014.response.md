Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.***
