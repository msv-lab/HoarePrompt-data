The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` after converting them to integers.

- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
- After executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**
