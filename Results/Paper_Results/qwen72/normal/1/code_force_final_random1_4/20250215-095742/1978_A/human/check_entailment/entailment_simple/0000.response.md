Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by always adding the largest number in the list (`nums[-1]`) and the second-largest number in the list (`max(nums[:-1])`). However, this approach is flawed because it assumes that the largest and second-largest numbers will always be the last and second-to-last elements in the list, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to sort the list and then sum the two largest values.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The correct answer should be 6 (by putting the two 3s in different piles), but the program will output 4 because it incorrectly assumes the last element is always the largest.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
