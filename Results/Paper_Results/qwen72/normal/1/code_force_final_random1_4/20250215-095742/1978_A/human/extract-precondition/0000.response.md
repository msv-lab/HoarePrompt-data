Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case list contains an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.**
