The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code, the variable `nums` will contain a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
