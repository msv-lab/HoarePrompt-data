The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case list contains an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case from the input `cases`. For each test case, the function determines some property or performs some operation based on the number of pages in the books and returns the result for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `cases` (a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book). It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and is determined based on the number of pages in the books.**
