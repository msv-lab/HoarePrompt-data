Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `nums`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
