The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers from the input

After executing the code snippet, the variable `nums` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the new input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the new input.**
