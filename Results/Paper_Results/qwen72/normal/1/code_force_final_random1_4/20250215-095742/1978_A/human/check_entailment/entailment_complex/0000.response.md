Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. However, the current implementation simply adds the maximum of the first `n-1` elements and the last element, which does not necessarily achieve the maximum possible sum of pages read.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the two largest numbers in the list of pages and add them together. This ensures that Alice reads the two books with the most pages, regardless of how the books are divided into piles.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the two largest numbers in the list
        nums.sort()
        max_pages = nums[-1] + nums[-2]
        
        print(max_pages)
```

This version sorts the list of pages and then adds the two largest numbers, which correctly maximizes the total number of pages Alice can read.

Given the original implementation, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
