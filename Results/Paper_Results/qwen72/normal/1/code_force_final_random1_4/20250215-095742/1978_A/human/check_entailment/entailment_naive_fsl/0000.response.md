Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always divide the books into two non-empty piles and then select the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages read. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the last book and the book with the highest number of pages among the rest will always yield the maximum sum. This assumption fails in cases where the optimal division involves different books.

Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 5 2 4
```
The correct output should be `9` (by dividing the books into piles `[1, 5]` and `[2, 4]`, and reading the books with 5 and 4 pages), but the program outputs `6` (by reading the books with 5 and 1 pages).
