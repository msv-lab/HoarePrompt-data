Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum of the first `n-1` numbers and the last number. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function completes, the input values `t`, `n`, and `nums` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. **
