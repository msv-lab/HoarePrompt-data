To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `j` and the length of the list `lis`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable starts at 1 and iterates up to `len(lis) - 1`.
2. **List `lis`**: The loop will execute if `lis` has at least two elements (since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `i` is 2 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`.

For the loop to execute:
- `lis` must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` must start at 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `lis` has at least 2 elements and `j` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1**
