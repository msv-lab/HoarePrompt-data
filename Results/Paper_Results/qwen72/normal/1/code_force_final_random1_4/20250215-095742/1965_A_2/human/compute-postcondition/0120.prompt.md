Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If `test` was initially True, and the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is greater than 1, the loop prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of `j` and sets `test` to False, breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop completes without printing anything and `test` remains False. If `test` was initially False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, `test` is False. Otherwise, `test` indicates whether the loop found any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`. If `test` is True, the loop found at least one gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`, and the length of `lis` can be either an odd or an even number.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, and `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, `test` is False. Otherwise, `test` is True, indicating that the loop found at least one gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`, and the length of `lis` can be either an odd or an even number.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
