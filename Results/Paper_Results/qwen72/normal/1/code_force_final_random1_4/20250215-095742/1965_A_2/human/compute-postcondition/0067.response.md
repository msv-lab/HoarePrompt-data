To determine what will be printed by the `print('Alice')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements.
   - `j` is 3.
   - If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('Alice')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`, or `test`, it will always print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
