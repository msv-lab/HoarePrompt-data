Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the game theory problem where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing stones from piles under specific rules. The goal is to determine the winner assuming optimal play. However, the implementation in `func_1` has a critical flaw in its logic for determining the winner.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initial Check (`if (arr[0] != 1)`):**
   - The function immediately returns 'Alice' if the first element of `arr` is not 1. This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the entire state of the piles, not just the first element. For example, if `arr` is `[2, 2, 2]`, Alice should still win, but the function would incorrectly return 'Alice' based on the first element being 2.

2. **Set and Sorting Logic:**
   - The function converts `arr` to a set and sorts it. It then checks the differences between consecutive elements. If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This part of the logic is intended to check if the game can be won by a specific strategy, but it is not correctly implemented.
   - The variable `A` is toggled within the loop, which is not a clear or correct way to determine the winner. The toggling of `A` does not align with the game's rules or the optimal play strategy.

3. **Final Decision:**
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise. However, the logic for setting `A` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, we need to use the concept of the Nim game, where the key is to compute the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) wins; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    xor_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_sum ^= num
    return 'Alice' if xor_sum != 0 else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the winner. The correct approach involves computing the XOR of all pile sizes.

Correctness: **False**
