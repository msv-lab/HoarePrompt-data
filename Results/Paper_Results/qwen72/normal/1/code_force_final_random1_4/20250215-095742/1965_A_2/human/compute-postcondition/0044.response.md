Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`, `test` is False if it was set to False during the loop execution or remains unchanged if it was initially False.**

Explanation:
- The line `l = map(int, input().split())` updates the variable `l` to be a map object containing integers from the input.
- The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `lis`, `j`, and `test` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `l` is a map object that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into an integer.
- All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
