Reasoning:  
The provided solution has several issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input**: The input reading part of the program is flawed. It reads the number of piles and the piles themselves in a way that could lead to incorrect parsing. Specifically, the line `n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))` should only read the number of piles, not the entire list of piles. This should be corrected to `n = int(input())`.

2. **Logic Flaw in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` has a logical flaw in how it determines the winner. The game's rules state that the player who cannot make a move loses. The function incorrectly assumes that if the first element of `arr` is not 1, Alice wins. This is not always true. For example, if the piles are `[2, 2, 2]`, Alice can still lose if Bob plays optimally.

3. **Incorrect Use of Set and Sorting**: The function uses a set to find unique elements and then sorts them. This is unnecessary and does not correctly reflect the game's rules. The game is about removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, and the key to determining the winner is the parity (odd/even) of the number of moves that can be made.

4. **Simplified Correct Logic**: The correct approach to determine the winner is to check the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of such piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each move reduces the number of stones in all non-empty piles by the same amount, and the game ends when all piles are empty.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
