The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several variables and their values:
  - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
  - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements.
  - `j` is 2.
  - `test` is True.

- However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Output:
Output: **Alice**
