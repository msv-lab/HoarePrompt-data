Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 3 elements.
- `j` is 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state, the output will always be the same regardless of their values.

Output: **Alice**
