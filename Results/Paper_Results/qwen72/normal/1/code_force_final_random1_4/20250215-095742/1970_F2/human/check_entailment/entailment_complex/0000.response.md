Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field, players, goals, movements, and the middle of the field.
   - It reads the initial state of the field and populates the `players`, `goals`, and `quidditch` variables accordingly.

2. **Movement Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the position of entities (players, Quaffle, Bludger) based on their movement direction.
   - It correctly calculates the new position by adding the movement vector to the current position.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program processes each move as described in the input.
   - For player movements, it updates the player's position and checks for collisions with the Bludger, eliminating players if necessary.
   - For catching the Quaffle, it assigns the Quaffle to the player.
   - For throwing the Quaffle, it checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

4. **Scoring and Elimination:**
   - The program correctly handles scoring by checking if a player is at the opponent's goal and updating the score.
   - It prints the appropriate messages for scoring and elimination events.

5. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all moves, the program prints the final score.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program has a minor issue in the `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block where `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who caught the Quaffle.
   - The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, but the problem statement guarantees that this situation does not occur.

Given these points, the program is mostly correct, but there is a small bug in the assignment operation when a player catches the Quaffle.

Correctness: **False**
