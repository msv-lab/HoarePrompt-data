The provided code snippet attempts to unpack the value of `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. However, since `a` is described as an integer, it cannot be unpacked in this way, which would result in a `TypeError`.

Given that the code will raise an error, no changes will be made to the variables `a` and `b`, and the state of the program will remain as it was before the code execution.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. An error occurs due to attempting to unpack an integer.**
