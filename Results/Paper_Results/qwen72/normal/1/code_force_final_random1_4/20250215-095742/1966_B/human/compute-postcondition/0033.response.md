The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `n` must still be greater than 1 (so `i` is less than `n - 1`).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is the same as the first character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr` and the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is the same as the last character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` is False. `ans` is 'NO'.**
