To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is the first integer provided by the user input
- `m` is the second integer provided by the user input
- `gr` is an empty list
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head itself.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` will be set by the loop itself, starting from 0 and incrementing up to `n-1`.

### Final State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `tc` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (adjusted to ensure the loop executes)
- `m` is the second integer provided by the user input (unchanged)
- `gr` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (set by the loop)
- `j` is `m-2` (unchanged)
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' (unchanged)

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'**
