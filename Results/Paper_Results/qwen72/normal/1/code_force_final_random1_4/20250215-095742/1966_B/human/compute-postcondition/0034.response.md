Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO'.** 

The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to False, overriding its previous value which was determined by the condition involving the first and last characters of the strings at indices `i` and `i + 1` in the list `gr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
