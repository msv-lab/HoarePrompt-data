The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `tc`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `t` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
