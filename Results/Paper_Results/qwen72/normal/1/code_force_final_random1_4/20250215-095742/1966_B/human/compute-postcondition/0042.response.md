Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `impossible` is True (all adjacent strings in `gr` have the same first and last characters), `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'NO' as well.***
