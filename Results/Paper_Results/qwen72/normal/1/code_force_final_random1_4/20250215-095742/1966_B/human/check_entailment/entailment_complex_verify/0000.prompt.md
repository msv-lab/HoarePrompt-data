You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is the original value provided by the user, `tc` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings representing the grid for the last test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`), and all cells in the first row and last row are the same, and all cells in the first column and last column are the same, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a grid of dimensions n x m with cells colored 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the top-left cell is different from the bottom-right cell. If they are different and all cells in the first and last rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same, the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any global state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining if it's impossible to make all squares the same color is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
According to the problem description, this grid cannot be made into a single color because any operation would only affect the subrectangle between two squares of the same color, and there are no such pairs in this grid. However, the program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case.

The issue lies in the logic where the program checks if it's impossible to make all squares the same color. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, but it doesn't consider the entire grid. This leads to incorrect results for grids like the one mentioned above.
