Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of adjacent characters in the first or last string of `gr` are not equal, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = m-2` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `j` will be `m-2`.
- The condition inside the loop checks if the `j`-th character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the first string, or if the `j`-th character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the last string.
- If any such pair of adjacent characters is found to be different, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- If no such pair is found, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
