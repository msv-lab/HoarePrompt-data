Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. For all `j` in the range `[0, m-2]`, `gr[0][j] == gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j] == gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, and `impossible` is True.**
