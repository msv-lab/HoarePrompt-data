To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the user input.
   - `m` is the second integer provided by the user input.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a user input from each iteration of the loop.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-2`.

2. **Condition for `ans`:**
   - If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

Let's analyze the condition step by step:

- `gr` is a list of lists, where each sublist is provided by the user.
- The first element of the first sublist in `gr` is `gr[0][0]`.
- The last element of the last sublist in `gr` is `gr[n-1][-1]`.

Based on the condition:
- If `gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][-1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
- If `gr[0][0] == gr[n-1][-1]`, then `ans` remains 'YES'.

Since the exact values of `gr` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given condition.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'NO' if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, otherwise ans is 'YES')**
