Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1.
   - `m` is the second integer provided by the user.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - `ans` is initially set to 'YES'.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and `impossible` is `True`, then:
     - For all `k` from 0 to `n - 2`, `gr[k][0] == gr[k + 1][0]` and `gr[k][m - 1] == gr[k + 1][m - 1]`.
     - In this case, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - If `impossible` is `False`, then:
     - At least one of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` is true for some `k` from 0 to `n - 2`.
     - In this case, `ans` remains 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` remains 'YES'.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the conditions described above.
   - If the conditions for setting `ans` to 'NO' are met, `ans` will be 'NO'.
   - If the conditions for keeping `ans` as 'YES' are met, `ans` will remain 'YES'.

Given the initial state and the logic, the final value of `ans` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions. Since the exact values of `gr` and `impossible` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` or if `impossible` is `False` and at least one of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` is true for some `k` from 0 to `n - 2`; otherwise, ans is 'NO')**
