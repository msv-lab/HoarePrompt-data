The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the first being the initial user input and the second being the new user input), `i` is 2, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
