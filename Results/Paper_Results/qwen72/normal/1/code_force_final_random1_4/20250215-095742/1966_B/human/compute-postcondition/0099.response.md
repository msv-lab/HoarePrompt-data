Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'YES'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 'YES'.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition about `ans` being 'NO' if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains part of the state. However, since `ans` is explicitly set to 'YES', this condition is overridden in the current context.
