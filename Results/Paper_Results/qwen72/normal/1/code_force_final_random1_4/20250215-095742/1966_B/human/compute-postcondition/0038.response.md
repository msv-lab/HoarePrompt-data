Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 2, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO'. If the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is different from the first character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr` or the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is different from the last character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.***
