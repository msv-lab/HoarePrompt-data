Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = 'NO'` assigns the string 'NO' to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was already 'NO' in the initial state, no change occurs to `ans`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
