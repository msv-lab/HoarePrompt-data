Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `impossible` is True, and `ans` is 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `impossible` is set to `True`.
- Since `impossible` is now `True`, the condition for setting `ans` to 'NO' is met, so `ans` is set to 'NO'.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
