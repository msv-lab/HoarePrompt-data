The code `gr.append(input())` appends the user input to the list `gr`. The user input is taken as a string and added to the list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` are integers provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing one user input string, `i` is 0**
