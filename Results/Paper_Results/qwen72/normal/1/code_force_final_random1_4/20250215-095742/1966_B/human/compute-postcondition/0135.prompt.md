You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' or 'B', representing the colors of the grid cells. The total number of cells across all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is the original value provided by the user, `tc` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings representing the grid for the last test case, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`), and all cells in the first row and last row are the same, and all cells in the first column and last column are the same, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a grid of dimensions n x m with cells colored 'W' or 'B'. It returns a result for each test case based on the configuration of the grid cells.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
