To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the expression `range(n - 1)` depends on `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 (the starting value of the range).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: Ensure `n` is greater than 1.
- **`i`**: Set `i` to 0.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 0
- `n` is the integer provided by the user input
- `m` is the integer provided by the user input
- `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- `impossible` is True
- `ans` is 'NO'

We need to adjust `n` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO'**
