The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition `i < k` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is either an empty string or 'a'.**
