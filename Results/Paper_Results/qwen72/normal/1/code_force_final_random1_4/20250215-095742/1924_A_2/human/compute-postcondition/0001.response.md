To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, as this is the condition that determines the number of iterations.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
- The string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
