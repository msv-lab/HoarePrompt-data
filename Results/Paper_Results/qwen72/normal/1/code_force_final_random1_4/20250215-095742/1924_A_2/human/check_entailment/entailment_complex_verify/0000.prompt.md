You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (which is 0), `n`, `k`, and `m` are the last input integers for the final test case, `s` is the last input string for the final test case, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` across all test cases, `ans` is the final concatenated string for the last test case, and `cur` is the final bitmask representing the characters seen in the last sequence of the last test case. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n` for the last test case, `ans` contains the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the character `tmp` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` can be divided into `n` segments such that each segment contains all `k` distinct characters. If possible, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a modified version of `s` that includes the necessary characters to form `n` valid segments. After processing all test cases, the function ends with the state of the last test case preserved in the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**: The program attempts to track the presence of subsequences using a bitmask (`cur`). However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if all characters from `a` to `k-1` have appeared at least once in the string `s`, but it does not ensure that all possible combinations of these characters of length `n` are present as subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` is used to count how many times the bitmask `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, which indicates that all characters from `a` to `k-1` have appeared at least once. This is not equivalent to counting all possible subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence**: When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it constructs a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans`. However, this construction is not guaranteed to produce a valid missing subsequence. For example, if `n = 3`, `k = 3`, and `s = "aabbcc"`, the program might incorrectly construct a missing subsequence like `"abc"` instead of a valid missing subsequence like `"ccc"`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, it should be printed as the missing subsequence. The current implementation does not perform this check correctly.
