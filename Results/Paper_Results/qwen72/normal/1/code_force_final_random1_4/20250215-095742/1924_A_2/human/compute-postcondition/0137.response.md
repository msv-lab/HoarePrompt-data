Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty string or the string containing the first character of `s`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, `cur` is 0, and `tmp` is an empty string. Otherwise, `cur` is either unchanged or set to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is unset, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
