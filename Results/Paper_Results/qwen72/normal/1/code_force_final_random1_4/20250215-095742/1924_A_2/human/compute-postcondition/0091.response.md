Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, and `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence. Additionally, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
