The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. The value of `tmp` is determined by the condition where `cur & 1 << i` is 0, which means `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where this condition holds true. If no such bit position exists, `tmp` remains an empty string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `n` is the first input integer
- `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0
- `m` is the third input integer
- `s` is a new input string
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0
- `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence
- `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string
- `cnt` is less than `n`

After executing the code snippet `ans += tmp`:
- If `tmp` is a non-empty string, `ans` will be updated to include this character.
- If `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `n` is the first input integer
- `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0
- `m` is the third input integer
- `s` is a new input string
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, and now includes the character `tmp` if `tmp` is not an empty string
- `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence
- `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string
- `cnt` is less than `n`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0 and now includes the character `tmp` if `tmp` is not an empty string, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, and `cnt` is less than `n`.**
