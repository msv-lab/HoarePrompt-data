Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is either 1 or `k`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop.
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0.
- `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a constant string.

Output: **NO**
