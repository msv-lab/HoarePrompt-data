Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
