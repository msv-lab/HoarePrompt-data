To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is initialized to 0 by default when the loop starts. It does not need to be adjusted because the loop will start with `i` as 0.

2. **Variable `k`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string with any number of characters
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`
- `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string**
