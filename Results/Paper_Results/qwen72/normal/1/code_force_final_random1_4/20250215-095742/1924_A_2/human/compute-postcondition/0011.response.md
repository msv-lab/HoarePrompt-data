Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
