Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `cur_ss` is calculated as the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
