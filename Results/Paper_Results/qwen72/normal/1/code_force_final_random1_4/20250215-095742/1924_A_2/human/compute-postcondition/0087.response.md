Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `cur` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- Since `cur` is explicitly set to 0, its value is now 0.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid and unchanged.
