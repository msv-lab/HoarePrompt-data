Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k - 1`. `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, and `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0 and now includes the character `tmp` if `tmp` is not an empty string, followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.***
