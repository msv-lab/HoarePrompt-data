Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 1 << cur_ss`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
