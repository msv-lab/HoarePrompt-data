Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = ''` sets the variable `ans` to an empty string.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
