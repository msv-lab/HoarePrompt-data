Output State: **`i` will be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `ans` is 1, `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and `x` and `n` are now the values provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is set to 1.
- The value of `i` remains `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- The variables `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The variable `q` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `x` and `n` are now the values provided by the user input.
