To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user input, with \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `q` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is set to \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \).
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that \( x - n \cdot d \) is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` and `n` are provided by the user, so their exact values are not known until runtime.
   - `i` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1. This value is used to limit the range of divisors to check.
   - `ans` is initially set to 1 and is updated if a suitable divisor `d` is found.

3. **Logic for Finding `ans`:**
   - The goal is to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that \( x - n \cdot d \) is non-negative and divisible by `d`.
   - This means \( x - n \cdot d \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot d) \% d == 0 \).

4. **Steps to Determine `ans`:**
   - Iterate over possible divisors `d` from `i` down to 1.
   - For each `d`, check if it divides `x` without a remainder.
   - If `d` is a divisor, check if \( x - n \cdot d \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot d) \% d == 0 \).
   - If both conditions are met, update `ans` to `d` and break the loop.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If a suitable divisor `d` is found, `ans` will be the largest such divisor.
   - If no suitable divisor is found, `ans` remains 1.

Given the initial state and the logic, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` as determined by the above steps.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that x - n * d is non-negative and divisible by d, or 1 if no such divisor exists)**
