Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problem set Yash can achieve. It iterates through potential divisors of \( x \) up to the square root of \( x \), checking if they can be used to form a valid problem set with \( n \) sub-problems. The conditions ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals \( x \) and that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized. The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
