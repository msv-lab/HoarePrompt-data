The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`, and `x` is at least 1, the value of `ans` will be updated to the higher of its current value or the new value of `i`. The other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `i`.**
