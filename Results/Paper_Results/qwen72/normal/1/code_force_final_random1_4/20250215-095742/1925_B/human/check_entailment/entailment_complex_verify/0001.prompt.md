You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x) for each iteration, `q` is `t - 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` for each iteration such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists for any iteration, `ans` remains 1 for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n` from the user. For each pair, it calculates the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`. If no such divisor exists, it defaults to 1. The function prints the result for each test case. After all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each iteration, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user, while the final printed value is the largest valid divisor found for each pair.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be used to form `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x` and whose GCD is maximized.
   - Specifically, it checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If both conditions are true, `i` is a valid candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks the same conditions for `x // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - It correctly checks if the divisor `i` can be used to form `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`.
   - It correctly updates the maximum GCD found so far.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 (trivial case where the GCD is `x` itself).
   - The program handles the case where `x` is 1 (trivial case where the GCD is 1).

5. **Optimization:**
   - The program uses the square root of `x` to limit the number of iterations, which is an efficient approach for finding divisors.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently finds the maximum GCD for the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
