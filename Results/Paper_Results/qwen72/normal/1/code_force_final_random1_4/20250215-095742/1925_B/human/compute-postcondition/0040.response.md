The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as `i + 1` and must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`, the new value of `ans` will be the larger of the original `ans` or the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans` and the current value of `i`.**
