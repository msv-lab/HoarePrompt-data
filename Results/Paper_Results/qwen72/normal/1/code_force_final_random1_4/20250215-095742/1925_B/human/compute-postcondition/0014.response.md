Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
