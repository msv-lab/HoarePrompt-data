Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. The expression `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `(x // i)`. Therefore, `ans` remains 1.**
