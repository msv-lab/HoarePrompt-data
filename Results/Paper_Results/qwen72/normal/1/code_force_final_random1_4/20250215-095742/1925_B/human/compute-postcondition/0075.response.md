Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `x` must be at least 9, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 3` if the condition `x - n * (x // 3) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // 3)) % (x // 3) == 0` holds true, otherwise `ans` remains 1. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1 if the condition holds true, and `x` is divisible by 1.***
