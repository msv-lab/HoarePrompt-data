To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions and variables present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
```

Here, the key variable is `i`, and the loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` contains at least one value. This means that `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1. Given the constraints \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), the smallest possible value for `x` is 1. For `x = 1`, `int(sqrt(1))` is 1, which means the range will be from 1 to 2, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `x` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
