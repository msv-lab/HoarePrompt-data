The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` being less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 and remained less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again, and it must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

State: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. `ans` remains unchanged unless the conditions within the loop body are met.**
