The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer with a range of 1 to 100.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is another input integer.
- `n` is equal to `m`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Output: **Yes**
