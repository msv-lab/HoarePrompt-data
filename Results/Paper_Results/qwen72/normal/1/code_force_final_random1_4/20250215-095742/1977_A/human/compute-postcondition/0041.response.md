Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer with a constraint 1 <= t <= 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.

The Python code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet will be:
Output: **Yes**
