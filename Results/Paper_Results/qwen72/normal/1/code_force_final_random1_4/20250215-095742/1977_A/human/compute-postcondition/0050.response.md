Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` were read from input, and the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.) were evaluated and printed accordingly.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This remains the same as it was initially, representing the total number of test cases.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `t-1` because the loop starts at 0 and increments `i` up to `t-1`.
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the last set of input values read during the final iteration of the loop. They are updated in each iteration based on the input provided.
- **Conditions**: For each iteration, the conditions inside the loop are evaluated based on the current values of `n` and `m`, and the appropriate message ('Yes' or 'No') is printed. The final state of the loop reflects that all `t` iterations have been completed, and the conditions have been checked for each pair of `n` and `m` values.
