### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The program's logic is overly complex and does not cover all necessary cases. The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move.

Let's break down the original program's logic and compare it with the correct approach:

1. **Original Program Logic:**
   - If `n == m`: This is correct. If the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it is possible.
   - If `m > n`: This is correct. If the desired number of cubes is greater than the number of moves, it is impossible.
   - If `m == n - 1`: This is correct. If the desired number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, it is possible.
   - If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: This is partially correct but unnecessary. It checks if both `n` and `m` are even, which is a special case of the general rule.
   - If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: This is also partially correct but unnecessary. It checks if both `n` and `m` are odd, which is another special case of the general rule.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No': This is incorrect because it misses the general rule that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This covers all cases where the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.

### Counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes`
- **Actual Output:** `No`

The program incorrectly outputs `No` because it does not correctly handle the general case where the difference between `n` and `m` is even.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version will handle all potential cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program is incorrect. The corrected program, as suggested in the original assessment, is the correct solution.
