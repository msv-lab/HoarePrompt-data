You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` were read from input, and the conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.) were evaluated and printed accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100) from the input. It then evaluates the relationship between `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions: 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, `m` is `n - 1`, both `n` and `m` are even, or both are odd; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita starts with an empty tower.
   - In each move, he can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, it's always possible to have `m` cubes by adding 1 cube in each move.
   - If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` allows for the possibility of removing cubes and still ending up with `m` cubes.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If `n == m`, the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, the answer is "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, the answer is "Yes" because you can add `m` cubes and then remove 1 cube.
   - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, the answer is "Yes" because both `n` and `m` being even means you can balance the number of additions and removals.
   - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, the answer is "Yes" because both `n` and `m` being odd means you can balance the number of additions and removals.
   - Otherwise, the answer is "No".

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks the conditions in the order specified:
     - `if n == m`: This is correct.
     - `elif m > n`: This is correct.
     - `elif m == n - 1`: This is correct.
     - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: This is correct.
     - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: This is correct.
     - `else`: This is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct result for each test case.
