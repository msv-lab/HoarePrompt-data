The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context, it seems that the function is designed to work within a framework where external inputs (like `t`, `n`, and `m`) are provided through a different mechanism, such as global variables or a testing framework. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases (`t`), where for each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100).

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the nature of the output, the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
