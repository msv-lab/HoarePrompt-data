Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- `m` is odd.
- `n` is odd.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even (which is redundant since both `m` and `n` are already specified as odd).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
