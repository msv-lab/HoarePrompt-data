Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement:

1. If `n` equals `m`, it's possible to build a tower of height `m` by adding a cube in each move, so the function prints 'Yes'.
2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to build a tower of height `m` because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves, so the function prints 'No'.
3. If `m` equals `n - 1`, it's possible to build a tower of height `m` by adding a cube in each move except one where a cube is removed, so the function prints 'Yes'.
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to build a tower of height `m` by alternating between adding and removing cubes in such a way that the final count of cubes added is `m`, so the function prints 'Yes'.
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it's also possible to build a tower of height `m` by a similar alternating strategy, so the function prints 'Yes'.
6. In all other cases, the function prints 'No', which covers scenarios where the parity of `m` and `n` does not match, making it impossible to achieve the desired tower height.

The logic in the program aligns with the problem requirements, and it should work correctly for the given constraints.
