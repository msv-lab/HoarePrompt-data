The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) and their relationships, but none of these variables or their values are used within the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state conditions and simply print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
