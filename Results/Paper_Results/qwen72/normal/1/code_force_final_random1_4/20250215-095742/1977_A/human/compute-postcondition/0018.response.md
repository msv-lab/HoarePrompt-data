Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even.
- Either `m` is even or `n` is even.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`. The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **No**
