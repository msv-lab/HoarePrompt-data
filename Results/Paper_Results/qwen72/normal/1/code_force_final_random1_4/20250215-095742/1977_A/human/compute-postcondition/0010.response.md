Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is equal to `n - 1`.

Given these conditions, the only consistent values for `n` and `m` are:
- `n` can be any integer.
- `m` must be `n - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
