Postcondition: ***`array2` is an empty list or contains one element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, depending on whether the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`. `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.***
