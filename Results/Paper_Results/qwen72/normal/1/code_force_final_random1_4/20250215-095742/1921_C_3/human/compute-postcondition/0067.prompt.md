Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `array2` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`array2` is an empty list or contains one element which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the single element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`array2` is an empty list or contains one element which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, or it contains two elements: `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` and `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers. If the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the single element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If the difference between the third element (`arr[2]`) and the second element (`arr[1]`) of `arr` is also less than `b / a`, `array2` contains both `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` and `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as it was initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`array2` is an empty list or contains one element which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, or it contains two elements: `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` and `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. If the difference between the third element (`arr[2]`) and the second element (`arr[1]`) of `arr` is less than `b / a`, and the difference between the fourth element (`arr[3]`) and the third element (`arr[2]`) of `arr` is also less than `b / a`, `array2` now contains three elements: `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, and `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as it was initially. `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
