To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(0, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and this sequence will be non-empty only if `n > 0`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`
- `feat` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`
- `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`
- `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `array2` is an empty list
- All other variables (`t`) remain unchanged

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is already set to 0, which is correct for the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 0

Therefore, the state after adjustments should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
