To determine what will be printed by the `print('No')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the value of `feat[0]`.
   - `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
   - `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is the third element of the new `feat`.
   - `b` is the last element of the new `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` must be greater than or equal to `f`.

Given these conditions, the `print('No')` statement will always print the string `'No'` because the conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **No**
