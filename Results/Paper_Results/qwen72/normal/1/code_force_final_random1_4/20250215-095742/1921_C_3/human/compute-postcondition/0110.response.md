The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process input data that includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of five components: an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, and a list of integers `m` of length `n`. Here, `n` represents the number of messages, `f` is the initial phone's charge, `a` is the charge consumption per unit of time, and `b` is the charge consumed when the phone is turned off and on sequentially. The list `m` contains the moments at which messages need to be sent, with each moment being a strictly increasing sequence of integers.

The function processes each test case and calculates whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge, considering the charge consumption patterns described. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating whether the phone can successfully send all messages (e.g., "Yes" or "No").

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption rates, and message sending times. It returns a list indicating whether the phone can send all messages for each test case without running out of charge.**
