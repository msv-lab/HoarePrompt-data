To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array2` contains all the results of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
   - `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

Given the initial state, the print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed directly in the statement itself. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **No**
