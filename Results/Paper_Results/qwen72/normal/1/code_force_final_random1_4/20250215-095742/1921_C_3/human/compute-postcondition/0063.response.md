Postcondition: ***`array2` is an empty list or contains one element which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, or it contains two elements: `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` and `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers. If the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the single element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If the difference between the third element (`arr[2]`) and the second element (`arr[1]`) of `arr` is also less than `b / a`, `array2` contains both `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` and `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as it was initially.***
