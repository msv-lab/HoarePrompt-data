The code appends a new element to `array2` calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `array2` initially might be empty or contain one element, which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.
- `i` is 2, so the new element being appended is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.
- `n` is greater than 2, ensuring there are at least 3 elements in `arr`.
- `feat` is a list of integers, and `f`, `a`, and `b` are derived from `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers.

After executing the code, `array2` will now contain the original element (if it existed) and the new element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.

Output State: **`array2` contains the elements `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` and `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers.**
