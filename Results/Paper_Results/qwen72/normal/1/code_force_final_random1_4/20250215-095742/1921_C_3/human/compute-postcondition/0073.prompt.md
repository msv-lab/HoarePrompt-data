Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge loss per unit time, and charge loss for turning the phone off and on, respectively. `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` are integers where 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the value of `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`array2` contains all the results of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met. `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as in the initial state, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then this condition holds true. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
