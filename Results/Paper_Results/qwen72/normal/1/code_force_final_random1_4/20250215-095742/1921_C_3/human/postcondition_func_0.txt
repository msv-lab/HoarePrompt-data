The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of messages `n`, initial phone charge `f`, charge loss per unit time `a`, charge loss for turning the phone off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m` when messages need to be sent. For each test case, it calculates whether the total charge loss required to send all messages (considering both the charge loss per unit time and the charge loss for turning the phone off and on) is less than the initial phone charge `f`. If the total charge loss is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
