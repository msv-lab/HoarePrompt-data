Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing one element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, depending on whether the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.***
