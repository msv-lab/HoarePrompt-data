Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`, `array2` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, `array2` contains `arr[0] * a`. For subsequent iterations, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` contains `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `feat`, `arr`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged. Additionally, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.**
