Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`.
- `array2` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions specified in the loop.
  - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
    - If `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, `array2` contains `arr[0] * a`.
    - For subsequent iterations, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` contains `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `feat`, `arr`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and conditions but does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- Since the `print` statement is a simple string literal, it will always print `'No'` regardless of the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
