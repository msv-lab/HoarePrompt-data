The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `feat`.

Given the initial state:
- `array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is the value of `feat[0]`.
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.

After executing the code snippet:
- `feat` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.

The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are derived from the new `feat` list:
- `n` is now `feat[0]`.
- `f` is now `feat[1]`.
- `a` is now `feat[2]`.
- `b` is now `feat[-1]`.

The values of `i`, `array2`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `test_cases` remains within the specified range.

Output State: **`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n`. `n` is `feat[0]`. `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. `feat` is a list of integers from the new input. `f` is `feat[1]`. `a` is `feat[2]`. `b` is `feat[-1]`. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
