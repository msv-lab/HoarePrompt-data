The code snippet appends the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` to `array2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a` also remains true.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` now contains the value `arr[0] * a`.**
