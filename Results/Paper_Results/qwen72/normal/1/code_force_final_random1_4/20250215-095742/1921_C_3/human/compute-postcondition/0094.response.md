Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Since `i` is 1, the expression evaluates to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If this condition is met (i.e., the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`), `array2` will have this new element. If the condition is not met, `array2` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` remain the same.
