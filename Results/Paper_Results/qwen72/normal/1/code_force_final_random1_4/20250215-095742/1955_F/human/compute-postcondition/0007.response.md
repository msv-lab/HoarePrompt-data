The code snippet updates the list `p` by converting each element to the nearest even number less than or equal to the original value. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of four integers. Each element in the list `p` is updated to the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input value.**
