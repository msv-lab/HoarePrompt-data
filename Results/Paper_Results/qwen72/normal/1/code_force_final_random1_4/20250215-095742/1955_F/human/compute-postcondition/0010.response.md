The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept a parameter `t` and a list of tuples `p` where each tuple contains four integers. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each tuple in the list `p` contains four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence, respectively.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the counts provided in each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.
