Functionality: ** The function `func` implicitly accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list `p_i` of four integers (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) from user input, representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It calculates a count `cnt` which is the sum of the floor division of each element in `p_i` by 2, plus an additional 1 if the first three elements of `p_i` are equal and odd. The function prints the value of `cnt` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
