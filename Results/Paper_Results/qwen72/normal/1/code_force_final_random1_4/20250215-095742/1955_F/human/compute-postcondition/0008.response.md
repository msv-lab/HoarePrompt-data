Let's break down the given code snippet step by step based on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `p`**:
   - `p` is a list of four even integers. Since each element is even, the condition `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False` for any element in `p`.

2. **Map and Sum**:
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies the lambda function to the first three elements of `p`.
   - Since all elements in `p` are even, `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False`, and the result of the map function will be a list of three `False` values.
   - `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))` will be `[False, False, False]`.
   - `sum([False, False, False])` will be `0` because `False` is equivalent to `0` in Python.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the sum of the list is equal to 3.
   - Since the sum is `0`, this condition will be `False`.
   - `False` is equivalent to `0` in Python.

4. **Sum of List `p`**:
   - `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `p`.
   - Since `p` contains four even integers, the sum of these integers will also be even.

5. **Integer Division**:
   - `sum(p) // 2` performs integer division of the sum of `p` by 2.
   - This will result in an integer value.

6. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression is `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`.
   - Since the first part of the expression is `0`, the final result will be `0 + sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the integer division of the sum of the elements in `p` by 2.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of the four even integers in the list p)**
