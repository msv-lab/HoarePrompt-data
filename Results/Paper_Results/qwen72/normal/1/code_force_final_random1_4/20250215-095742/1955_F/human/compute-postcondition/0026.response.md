Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p_i` is a list of four integers where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - Initially, `cnt` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it starts with some initial value (let's call it `initial_cnt`).
   - The value of `cnt` is then updated to `initial_cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.
   - `math.floor(x / 2)` computes the floor division of each element `x` in the list `a` by 2, which means it divides `x` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer.
   - `sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)` calculates the sum of these floor divisions for all elements in `a`.

2. **Final Value of `cnt`**:
   - The final value of `cnt` will be the initial value of `cnt` plus the sum of the floor divisions of the elements in `a`.

### Output:
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt` after it has been updated. Since the initial value of `cnt` is not specified, we can only describe the final value in terms of the initial value and the sum of the floor divisions.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the initial value of cnt plus the sum of the floor divisions of the elements in the list a)**

This output clearly describes the value that will be printed, taking into account the initial state and the operations performed on `cnt`.
