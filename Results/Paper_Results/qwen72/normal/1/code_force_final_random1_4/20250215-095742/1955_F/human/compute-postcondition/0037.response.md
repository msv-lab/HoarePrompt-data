The value of `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. The value of `x` is the third element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(a[0] / 2) + math.floor(a[1] / 2) + math.floor(a[2] / 2) if `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(a[0] / 2) + math.floor(a[1] / 2) + math.floor(a[2] / 2), `x` is the third element of `a`.**
