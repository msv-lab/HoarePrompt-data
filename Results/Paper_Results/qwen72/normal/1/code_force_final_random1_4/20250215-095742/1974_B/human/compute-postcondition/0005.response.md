Output State: **`s` is the original string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original string `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`, and `char` is in `unique_chars`.** 

The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so it is now `len(unique_chars) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
