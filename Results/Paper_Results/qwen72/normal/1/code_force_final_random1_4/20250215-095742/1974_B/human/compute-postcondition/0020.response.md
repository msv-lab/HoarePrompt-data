The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` (the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters) with `unique_chars[j]`. `char` is the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters, `i` is 0 or 2 depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 4` if the previous `char` was in `unique_chars` or `len(unique_chars)` if the previous `char` was not in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s`.**
