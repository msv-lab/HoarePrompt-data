Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`, and `char` is now in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1.
- All other variables (`s`, `unique_chars`, `j`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
