To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `char` and the string `s`.

- The variable `char` will take each character from the string `s` one by one as the loop iterates.
- For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`.
- `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.

Since the loop will iterate over each character in `s`, the only requirement for the loop to execute is that `s` must not be empty. Given that the length of `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`**
