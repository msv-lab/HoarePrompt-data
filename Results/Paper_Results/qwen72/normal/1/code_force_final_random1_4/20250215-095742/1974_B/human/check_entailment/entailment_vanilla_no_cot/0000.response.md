Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the sorted unique characters list, but it does so in a way that does not preserve the original structure of the string. Specifically, the use of `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` within a loop can lead to unintended replacements because `replace` changes all occurrences of `char` in the entire string, not just the current position being processed. Additionally, the logic for handling characters not in `unique_chars` by inserting them into the list is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.

A correct approach would involve creating a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart and then applying this mapping to each character in the input string `b` to produce the decoded string. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This function correctly maps each character in the input string to its corresponding character in the decoded string according to the specified encoding rules.
