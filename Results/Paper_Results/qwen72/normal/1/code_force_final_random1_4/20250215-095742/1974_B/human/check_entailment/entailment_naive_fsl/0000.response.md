Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `func_1` function processes the string `s`. The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the `unique_chars` list, but it does so in a way that does not preserve the original order of characters in the string.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect output because the `replace` method is used in a loop, which can lead to unintended replacements. For example, when the first character 's' is replaced by 'c', the subsequent 'c' characters in the string will also be replaced, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate the issue, let's step through the function with the input "serofedsoc":

1. `unique_chars` is `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`.
2. The first character 's' is replaced by 'c', resulting in "cerofedcoc".
3. The next character 'e' is replaced by 'r', resulting in "crrofedcoc".
4. This continues, leading to incorrect final output.

A correct implementation would involve creating a mapping from each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars` and then applying this mapping to the entire string `s` without modifying the string during the iteration.
