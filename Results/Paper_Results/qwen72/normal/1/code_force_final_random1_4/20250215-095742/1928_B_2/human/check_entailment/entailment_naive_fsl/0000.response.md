Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The functions defined in the code do not address the core requirement of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. Specifically, none of the functions provided handle the process of generating permutations, adding them to the array, or counting the frequency of elements after such operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
