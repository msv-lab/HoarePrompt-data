Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` from the last element to the first. `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`. `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains the same as it was initially because the loop does not modify `arr`.
- `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first. For example, if `arr` was `[a, b, c, d]`, then `ans` will be `[d, d*c, d*c*b, d*c*b*a]`.
- `tem` ends up being the product of all elements in `arr` because it accumulates the product of each element as the loop progresses.
- `i` is -1 after the loop completes, as the loop decrements `i` until it reaches -1, which is the condition that stops the loop.
