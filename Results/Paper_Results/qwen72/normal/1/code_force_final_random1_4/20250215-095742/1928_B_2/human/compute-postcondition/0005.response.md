To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element.
- `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`.
- `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `arr` must have at least one element.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`.
- **`arr`**: The length of `arr` remains the same, but the loop condition requires that `i` must still be non-negative. Therefore, `arr` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.

### Updated State:
- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**.
