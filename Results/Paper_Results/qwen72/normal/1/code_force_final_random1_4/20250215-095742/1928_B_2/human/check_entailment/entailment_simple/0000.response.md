### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of elements in the array `a` that can become equal after adding a permutation of length `n` to the array.
   - The permutation consists of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` again.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `func_3()`, sorts it, and removes duplicates.
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of elements that can become equal.
   - It iterates over the unique elements of the sorted array `arr`.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the position `a` where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array using `bisect_left`.
   - It computes the difference `d = a - i`, which represents the number of elements in the range `[arr[i], arr[i] + n]`.
   - It updates `ans` with the maximum value of `d`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program uses `set` to remove duplicates from the array, which is unnecessary because we need to consider all elements in the array.
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the position of `arr[i] + n` in the sorted array is not directly relevant to the problem. We need to count the number of elements that can become equal after adding a permutation, not just the positions in a sorted array.
   - The logic of calculating `d` and updating `ans` does not correctly solve the problem. It does not account for the fact that the permutation can be added to the array in such a way that multiple elements can become equal.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the frequency of each possible sum after adding the permutation.
   - For each element `a_i` in the array, the possible sums are `a_i + 1, a_i + 2, ..., a_i + n`.
   - We need to count the frequency of each possible sum and find the maximum frequency.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to calculate the maximum number of elements that can become equal is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
