#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter a value, converts the input to an integer, and returns this integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer value entered by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the standard input, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the input (which is split by spaces) into an integer. The input is taken from the standard input, and each element is expected to be a string representation of an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the input by spaces, and converts each element into an integer, returning a map object containing these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object is returned, which can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the user's input, where each integer was separated by spaces in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns a sorted list of these integers.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, which are converted from the input strings provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and returns the sorted list. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, splitting the input into a list of strings.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into a string. The input is taken from the user and split into a list of strings, which are then mapped to string type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings based on spaces, and returns a map object that converts each element of this list into a string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object representing the split and converted input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_6` does not take any parameters.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list containing each character from the input string as individual elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the user input and returns a list where each element is a single character from the input string. After the function concludes, the program has a list of characters, and no other changes are made to the program state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_7` does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is an element from the input provided by the user, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string, and returns a sorted list of these strings. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a sorted list of strings derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers with `n` elements (where `n` is the length of `arr`), `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` up to each index, `tem` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`, and `i` is `n-1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` up to each index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes a list of positive integers `arr` as input and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to that index. After the function executes, `arr` remains unchanged, and `ans` contains the cumulative products.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` from the last element to the first. `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`. `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. The list `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements of `arr`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
