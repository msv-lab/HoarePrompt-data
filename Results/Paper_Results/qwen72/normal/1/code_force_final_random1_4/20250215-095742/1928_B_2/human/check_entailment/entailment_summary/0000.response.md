### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. Let's break down the logic and verify if the program meets the requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` again.
   - It then reads the array elements using `func_3()` and converts them to a set to remove duplicates. This is done to ensure that we are only considering unique elements in the array.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The array is sorted to facilitate the binary search operations.
   - The maximum value in the array is determined using `max(arr)`.
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to keep track of the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency:**
   - The program iterates over each unique element in the sorted array.
   - For each element, it calculates the position of the element plus `n` using `bisect_left`.
   - The difference between the current position and the calculated position gives the count of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The program updates `ans` with the maximum count found.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum count for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of the array.
  - It reads the array elements and ensures they are unique and sorted.

- **Logic:**
  - The use of `bisect_left` to find the position of the element plus `n` is appropriate for determining the count of elements that can be made equal.
  - The program correctly updates the maximum count and prints the result for each test case.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where the array might have repeated elements by converting it to a set.
  - It also handles the case where the array length is 1 or the elements are already in a form that can be easily transformed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in the array after adding a permutation. It follows the problem description and handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
