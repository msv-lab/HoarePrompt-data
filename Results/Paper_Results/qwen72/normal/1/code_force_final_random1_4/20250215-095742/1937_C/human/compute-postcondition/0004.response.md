Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 2 (not used in the print statement).
- `k` is 1.
- `i` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- `'?'` is a string literal, so it will be printed as is.
- `0` is a numeric literal, so it will be printed as 0.
- `k` is a variable with the value 1, so it will be printed as 1.
- Another `0` is a numeric literal, so it will be printed as 0.
- `i` is a variable with the value 2, so it will be printed as 2.

The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
