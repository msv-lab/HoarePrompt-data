The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n-1`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. Before the loop starts, `k` is 1 and `_` is a placeholder, but these do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is set to 2.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 1, `i` is 2**
