The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, and `best` is set to 1. If `res` is not `<`, `k` remains 1 and `best` remains 0.**
