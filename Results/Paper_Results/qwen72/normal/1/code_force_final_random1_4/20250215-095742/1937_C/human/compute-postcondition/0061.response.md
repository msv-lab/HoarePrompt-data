Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `res` is the last input string (not used in the print statement).
   - `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
   - `best` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a literal and will be printed as is.
   - `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<`. If no such input exists, `k` remains 1.
   - `best` is 0.
   - `k` is again the same value as determined above.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will concatenate these values into a single string with spaces in between each value.

Given the initial state, the values of the variables are:
- `k` is 1 (since no specific input being `<` is mentioned, `k` remains 1).
- `best` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
