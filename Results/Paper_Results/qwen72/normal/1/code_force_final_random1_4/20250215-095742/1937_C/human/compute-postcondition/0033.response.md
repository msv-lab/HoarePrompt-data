Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 3 (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
- `i` is 3.
- `res` is the new input string.
- If `res` is `<`, then:
  - `k` is updated to 1.
  - `best` is set to 2.
- Otherwise:
  - `k` remains the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` (or 1 if no input was `<`).
  - `best` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `k` and `best` based on `res`:**
   - If `res` is `<`:
     - `k` is 1.
     - `best` is 2.
   - If `res` is not `<`:
     - `k` remains the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` (or 1 if no input was `<`).
     - `best` remains 0.

2. **Substitute the values into the print statement:**
   - If `res` is `<`:
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', 1, 2, 1, 3, flush=True)`
   - If `res` is not `<`:
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', k, 0, k, 3, flush=True)` where `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` (or 1 if no input was `<`).

### Final Output:
- If `res` is `<`:
  - Output: **? 1 2 1 3**
- If `res` is not `<`:
  - Output: **? [k] 0 [k] 3** (where [k] is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` or 1 if no input was `<`)

Since the exact value of `k` depends on the input history, we can only provide a general form for the case where `res` is not `<`.

Output: **? 1 2 1 3** (if `res` is `<`)
Output: **? [k] 0 [k] 3** (if `res` is not `<`, where [k] is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` or 1 if no input was `<`)
