The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through a series of queries and responses. The input consists of multiple test cases, each defined by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), representing the size of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can make at most 3n queries to determine a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. Each query involves selecting four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a response indicating the relationship between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The total number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
