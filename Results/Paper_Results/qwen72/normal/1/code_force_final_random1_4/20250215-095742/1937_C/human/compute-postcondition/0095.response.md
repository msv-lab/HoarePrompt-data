Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n`, `res` is the new input string, `k` is `n`, and `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
