Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `res` is the new input string.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
2. **`0`**: This is a literal integer and will be printed as is.
3. **`k`**: 
   - Initially, `k` is set to 1.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `k` will be either 1 or `n-1` depending on the value of `res`.
4. **`0`**: This is another literal integer and will be printed as is.
5. **`i`**: 
   - `i` is defined as `n-1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 2, `i` will be a positive integer greater than 1.

### Possible Values:
- If `res` is not `<`, then `k` remains 1.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` becomes `n-1`.

### Final Output:
- If `res` is not `<`:
  - `k` is 1.
  - `i` is `n-1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 1 0 n-1`.

- If `res` is `<`:
  - `k` is `n-1`.
  - `i` is `n-1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 n-1 0 n-1`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the format of the output will be consistent.

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 [n-1]** (where [k] is 1 if `res` is not `<`, and `n-1` if `res` is `<`, and [n-1] is the value of `n-1`).
