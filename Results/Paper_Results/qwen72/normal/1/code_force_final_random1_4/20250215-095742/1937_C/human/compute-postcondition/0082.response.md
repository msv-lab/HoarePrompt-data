Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is `n-1` (this value will be adjusted by the loop, but for the purpose of this print statement, it is `n-1`).
- `res` is the last input string (not used in the print statement).
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0 (not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
- The next value is `0`.
- The value of `k` is `1`.
- The next value is `0`.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- `?` (a question mark)
- `0` (the integer zero)
- `1` (the value of `k`)
- `0` (the integer zero)
- `n-1` (the value of `i`, which is `n-1`)

### Formatted Output:
Output: **? 0 1 0 n-1** (where `n` is the value of `n` and `i` is `n-1`)
