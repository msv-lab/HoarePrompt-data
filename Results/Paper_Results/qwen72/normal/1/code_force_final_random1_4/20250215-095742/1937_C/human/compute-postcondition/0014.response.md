The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 4).

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `res` is an input string, and `k` is 3 regardless of the value of `res`**
