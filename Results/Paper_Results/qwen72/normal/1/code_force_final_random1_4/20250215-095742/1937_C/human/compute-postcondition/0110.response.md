The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 1 and `best` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 1 and `best` is 0.**
