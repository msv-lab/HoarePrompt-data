Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It determines a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function can make up to 3n queries, each involving four indices a, b, c, d to compare (p_a | p_b) with (p_c | p_d). The function handles multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases t ranging from 1 to 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4. The function returns the pair of indices (i, j) that maximize p_i âŠ• p_j for each test case.**
