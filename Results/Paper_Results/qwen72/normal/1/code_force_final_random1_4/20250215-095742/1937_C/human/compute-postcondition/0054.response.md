Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `'?'` is a constant string.
   - `0` is a constant integer.
   - `k` is initially 1, but it can change based on the value of `res`.
     - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to `n`.
     - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
   - `0` is another constant integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output the following values in order:
     - `'?'`
     - `0`
     - `k` (which is either 1 or `n` depending on the value of `res`)
     - `0`
     - `i` (which is `n-1`)

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `res` is not `<`: `? 0 1 0 n-1`
- If `res` is `<`: `? 0 n 0 n-1`

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 [n-1] (where [k] is 1 if res is not '<', otherwise [k] is n, and [n-1] is the value of n-1)**
