The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(input())` must return a positive integer because the loop iterates over a range of values from 0 up to but not including the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the context of the problem, the input is expected to be the number of test cases, `t`, and this value must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer, specifically 1 or more.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input provided must be a positive integer (at least 1)**
