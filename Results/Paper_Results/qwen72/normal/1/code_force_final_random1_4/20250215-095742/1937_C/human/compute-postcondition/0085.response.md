Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string, `k` is `n-1`, `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0, and the current value of `res` is `<`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is `n-1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
