Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string, `k` is `n-1`, and `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
