The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `i` relative to the input value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the input value.

Since the input value is not specified in the state, we can only assume that the loop will execute again if the input value is greater than 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now 2 and the input value must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` are even, the program does nothing. If either `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, or if `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the program also does nothing. The input value must be greater than 1.**
