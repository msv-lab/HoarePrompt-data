Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 2. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input. If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, the values of `a` and `b` remain as the updated values. If `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the values of `a` and `b` also remain as the updated values. If `(a - b) % 2` is equal to 0, the values of `a` and `b` remain as the updated values.***
