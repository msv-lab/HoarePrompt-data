The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `i` relative to the input provided. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input must be a positive integer greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is 0.
- The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0.

After the first iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- The input must still be a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, and the input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0.**
