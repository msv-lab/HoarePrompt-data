Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic within the conditions is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **First Condition (`if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if both dimensions `a` and `b` are even. However, this is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles and reformed into a 1x4 rectangle, but the program would incorrectly output "yes" for a 4x4 rectangle, which cannot be reformed into a different rectangle.

2. **Second Condition (`elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`)**:
   - This condition is logically incorrect. It checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, which is always false because it compares tuples. This condition should be simplified to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but even then, it is not the correct approach to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

3. **Third Condition (`elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, this is not a valid criterion for determining if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and reformed into a 1x6 rectangle, but the program would incorrectly output "yes" for a 3x1 rectangle, which cannot be reformed into a different rectangle.

4. **Else Condition**:
   - The else condition outputs "no" for all other cases, which is not always correct. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles and reformed into a 1x8 rectangle, but the program would incorrectly output "no".

A correct approach would involve checking if either dimension is greater than 1 and if the product of the dimensions is greater than the maximum possible dimension after cutting. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a > 1 and b > 1:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This corrected function correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description.
