Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original, considering rotations as equivalent.

The provided solution attempts to solve this problem through a series of conditions:

1. **Both dimensions are even**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles and recombined to form a new rectangle. This is because you can cut it into two equal parts along either dimension, and then recombine them in a different orientation to form a new rectangle. This condition is correctly handled.

2. **Difference between dimensions is odd**: The logic here seems to be checking if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, which would imply that at least one of the dimensions is even, allowing for a cut and recombination to form a new rectangle. However, the implementation of this condition is flawed. The conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are not logical and do not serve the intended purpose. Additionally, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant because it always evaluates to `True` for non-zero differences, which is not the correct logic.

3. **Other cases**: The program incorrectly handles other cases by printing 'no' when it should be more nuanced.

A correct approach would be to check if at least one of the dimensions is even, which allows for a cut and recombination to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

Given the issues in the original logic and the need for a simpler and more accurate condition, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
