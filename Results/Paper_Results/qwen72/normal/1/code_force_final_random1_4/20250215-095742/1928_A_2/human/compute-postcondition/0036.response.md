Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If at least one of `a` or `b` is even, `a1` is equal to `a // 2` if `a` is even, and `b1` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even. Additionally, `a2` is equal to `a // 2` if `a` is even, and `b2` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even. If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.***
