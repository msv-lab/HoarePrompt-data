Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is 0.
- The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space.
- Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd.
- Neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` holds true.
- The difference between `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2, meaning \((a - b) \% 2\) is either greater than 0 or less than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`.
- The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement.
- The `print` statement will always execute and print the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, or any other variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
