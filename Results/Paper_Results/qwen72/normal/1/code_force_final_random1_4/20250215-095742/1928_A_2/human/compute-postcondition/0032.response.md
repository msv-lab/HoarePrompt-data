Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` are even, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input. If either `a` or `b` is odd, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged regardless of the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)`, `(b - a == -b, b)`, or `(a - b) % 2` being true or false.***
