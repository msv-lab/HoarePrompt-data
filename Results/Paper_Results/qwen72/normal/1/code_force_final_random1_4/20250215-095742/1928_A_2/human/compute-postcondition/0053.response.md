The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters related to the test cases, specifically `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would process each test case and return a result based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b`.**
