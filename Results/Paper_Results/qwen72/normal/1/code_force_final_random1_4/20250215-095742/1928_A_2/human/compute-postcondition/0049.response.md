Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is also set to `a // 2`.
- If `b` is even, `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`.
- If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.
- If `b` is not even, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.

Given these conditions, the `print('No')` statement will execute if the program reaches this point. This means that the conditions for continuing to the next iteration or statement have not been met, and the program has decided to print 'No'.

Output: **No**
