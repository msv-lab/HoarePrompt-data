The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is 'L', `b` has one more element appended from `a[l]`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` now contains the element `a[r+1]` appended to it, and `r` is decreased by 1.**
