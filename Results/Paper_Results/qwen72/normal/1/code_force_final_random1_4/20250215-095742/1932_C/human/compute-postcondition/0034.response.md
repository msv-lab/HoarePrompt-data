Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `p * v % m` and `p`, `p` is now `(p * v % m) * v % m`, `v` is the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * v % m`.
- All other variables (`i`, `b`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `v`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `p` is calculated as `(p * v % m) * v % m`, which is the result of the given operation.
