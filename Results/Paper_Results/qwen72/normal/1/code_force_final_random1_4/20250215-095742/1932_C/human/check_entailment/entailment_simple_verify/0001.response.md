Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This part is correct.

2. **Function Call**: For each test case, the program calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. This is also correct.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a`. It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right boundaries of the array. This is correct.
   - **Processing Commands**: The function iterates through each command in the string `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - **Product Calculation**: After processing all commands, the function calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the modulus `m` at each step. However, this approach is incorrect because the problem requires the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` at each step, not the product of the removed elements. The function should calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` before removing the element, not the product of the removed elements.
   - **Result Construction**: The function returns the results in the correct order by reversing the list `ans`. However, since the product calculation is incorrect, the results will also be incorrect.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list returned by `func_1`. This part is correct, but the results will be incorrect due to the flawed product calculation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a single-element array and multiple test cases correctly.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the product does not overflow and the results are accurate, but the logic for calculating the product is flawed.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality because it calculates the product of the removed elements instead of the product of the remaining elements in the array at each step.

Final: **False**
