To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`
- `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`
- `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0
- `ans` is a list containing the value `p * v % m`
- `p` is `p * v % m`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for v in reversed(b):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order.
- The loop variable `v` is set to the next element in `reversed(b)` at the start of each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `v`.
- Since `b` is a non-empty list, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `b`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the last element of `b` (since the loop is iterating in reverse).
2. **Next State**: For the next iteration, `v` will be the second-to-last element of `b`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `v` needs to be adjusted to the next element in the reversed list `b`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `p`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `p * v % m`, `p` is `p * v % m`, `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`**
