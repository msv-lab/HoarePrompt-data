Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s` (if 'L', elements are taken from the left; if 'R', elements are taken from the right), `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, and `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0. `ans` is an empty list.**
