Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer from user input, `B` is the second integer from user input, `C` is the third integer from user input, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, `C`) remain unchanged.
