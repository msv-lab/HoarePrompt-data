The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the number of test cases (`t`), the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy (`n`), the price for one yogurt (`a`), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (`b`). 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, considering both the individual price (`a`) and the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. It then returns the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. It returns the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts for each test case.**
