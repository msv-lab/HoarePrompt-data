Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is the first integer from user input.
- `B` is the second integer from user input.
- `C` is the third integer from user input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.
- `A` and `B` are integers provided by the user input.
- Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `A * B`.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the user-provided values.

### Final Output:
Output: **A * B (where A and B are the first and second integers provided by the user, respectively)**
