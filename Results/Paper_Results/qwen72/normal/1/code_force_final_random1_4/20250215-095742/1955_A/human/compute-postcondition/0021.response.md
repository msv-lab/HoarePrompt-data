The provided code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `i` is 2, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input, each greater than 0. After the code executes, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated based on the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer from user input, `B` is the second integer from user input, `C` is the third integer from user input.** 

If `B * 2 < C`, there are no further changes to the variables. If `B * 2 >= C`, and if `A` is even, there are no additional changes. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

Since the provided code snippet only updates the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` from user input, and does not include the conditional logic to set `X`, the output state reflects only the updated values of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
