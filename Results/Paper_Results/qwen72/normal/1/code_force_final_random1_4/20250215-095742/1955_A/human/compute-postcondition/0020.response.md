The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop condition is based on the value of `i` being less than the integer provided by the user input. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The other conditions (`B * 2 < C`, `A` being even or odd, etc.) do not affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. If `B * 2 >= C`, and if `A` is even, there are no additional changes. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
