Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input, and each is greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - `A` and `C` are integers provided by the user input.
   - The product `A * C` is computed first.
   - This product is then divided by 2, resulting in a floating-point number.
   - The `int` function is used to convert this floating-point number to an integer by truncating the decimal part (i.e., it performs floor division).

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the integer result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0)**
