Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the individual price `a` and the promotional price for two yogurts `b`. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Check if the promotional price is beneficial**: If the cost of two yogurts individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. In this case, the total cost is simply `A * B`.

2. **Even number of yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is even, the program calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the number of pairs of yogurts multiplied by the promotional price.

3. **Odd number of yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program calculates the total cost as `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2` (the number of pairs of yogurts) and `B` is the cost of the remaining single yogurt.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `2 5 9`
  - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 9` is false, and `A` is even, the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `3 5 9`
  - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 9` is false, and `A` is odd, the cost is `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `3 5 11`
  - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 11` is true, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `4 5 11`
  - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 11` is true, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
