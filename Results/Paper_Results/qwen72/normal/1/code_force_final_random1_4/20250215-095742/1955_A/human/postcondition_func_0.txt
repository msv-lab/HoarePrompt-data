The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`, representing the number of items, the price per item, and the promotional price for two items, respectively. The function calculates and prints the minimum cost to purchase `A` items based on the following rules: if the cost of two items individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it prints `A * B`. If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`. If `A` is odd, it prints `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the minimum cost for each test case.
