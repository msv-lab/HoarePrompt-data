Output State: **After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `t - 1`, and the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case are processed according to the conditions in the loop. For each test case, if `B * 2 < C`, the output is `A * B`. If `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`. If `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case are reset for the next iteration, and the loop processes `t` test cases in total.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` still represents the total number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 10^4). The loop counter `i` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each test case, the loop calculates and prints the cost based on the given conditions, and the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are reset for each new test case. The loop processes all `t` test cases, and the final state reflects the completion of these test cases.
