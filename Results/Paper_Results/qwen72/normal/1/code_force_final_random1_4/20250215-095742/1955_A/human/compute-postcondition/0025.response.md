Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not directly used in the code snippet.
   - `i` is 2. This value is not directly used in the code snippet.
   - `A` is the first integer from user input.
   - `B` is the second integer from user input.
   - `C` is the third integer from user input.
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(X * C + B)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
   - The expression `X * C + B` is then evaluated:
     - `X * C` multiplies the result of `A // 2` by `C`.
     - `B` is added to the result of `X * C`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`.
   - Since `X` is `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are the first, second, and third integers from user input, respectively)**
