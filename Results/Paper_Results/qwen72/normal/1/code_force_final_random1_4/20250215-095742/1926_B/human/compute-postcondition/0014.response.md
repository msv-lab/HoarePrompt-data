The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1's in the string representation of `b` to the list `k`.

- Initially, `k` is either an empty list or contains the number of '1's in the string representation of `b`.
- After executing the code, `k` will contain the number of '1's in the string representation of `b` appended to its current contents.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the input string, `k` is a list containing the number of '1's in the string representation of `b` (appended to its previous contents).**
