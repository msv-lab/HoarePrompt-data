Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the last input string, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string that contained at least one '1'. If no input strings contained '1's, `k` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, the loop reads a string `b` from the input.
- If the string `b` contains at least one '1', the count of '1's in `b` is appended to the list `k`.
- After all iterations, `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each input string that had at least one '1'.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
