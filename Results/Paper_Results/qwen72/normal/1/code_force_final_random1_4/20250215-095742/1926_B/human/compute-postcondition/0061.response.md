Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- The grid is represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is the last input string provided by the user.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop.
- The first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).

Given these conditions, the print statement is:

```python
print('SQUARE')
```

### Explanation:
- The condition `k[0] == k[1]` implies that the count of '1's in the first two input strings `b` is the same.
- Since the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, the fact that the count of '1's in the first two input strings is the same suggests that the shape is a square.
- A triangle would typically have a different number of '1's in each row, whereas a square would have the same number of '1's in each row.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **SQUARE**
