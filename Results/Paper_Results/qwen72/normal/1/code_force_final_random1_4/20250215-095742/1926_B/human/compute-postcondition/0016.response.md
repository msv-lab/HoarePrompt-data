Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is the input string, and `k` is a list. If `b` contains at least one '1', `k` will have two elements, both being the count of '1's in `b`. If `b` does not contain any '1's, `k` will remain an empty list.***
