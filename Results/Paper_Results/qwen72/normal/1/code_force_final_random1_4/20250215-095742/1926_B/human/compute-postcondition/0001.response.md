To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `a`.
- The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0.
- The initial state provided includes `t`, `n`, and the grid description, but these are not directly relevant to the loop head.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(a):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `a-1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure it is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the grid) do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
