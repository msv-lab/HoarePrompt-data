Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is the last input string provided by the user, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop, and the first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).**
