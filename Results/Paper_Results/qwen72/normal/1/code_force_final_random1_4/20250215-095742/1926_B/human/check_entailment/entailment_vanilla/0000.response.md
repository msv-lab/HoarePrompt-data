Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function collects the count of '1's in each row into a list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.
   - After collecting the counts, it checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`). If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

3. **Logic for Shape Detection**:
   - For a **square**, all rows should have the same number of '1's. Therefore, checking if the first two elements of `k` are equal is sufficient to identify a square.
   - For a **triangle**, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern \(2 \cdot i - 1\) for a regular triangle or the reverse for an upside-down triangle. However, the key observation is that the number of '1's in the first row will be different from the second row for a triangle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) and that the shape is larger than a single cell. This means the logic of comparing the first two elements of `k` is valid.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the provided problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
