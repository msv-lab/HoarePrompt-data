You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads lines from the standard input starting from the second line. For each line, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` represents the number of introverts, `b` represents the number of extroverts, and `c` represents the number of universals. It then adds the value of `c` to `b` and prints a result based on the condition `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `c` hold the values from the last line processed, and `b` holds the sum of the original value of `b` and all values of `c` encountered during the iterations. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Introverts need their own tent.
   - Extroverts need to share a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be placed in any type of tent.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we need at least `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need `b` extroverts to be placed in `b // 3` tents, and there will be `b % 3` extroverts left over.
   - **Universals:** Universals can fill the remaining spots in the tents. We need to check if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the help of universals.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input into `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts (`b += c`).
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to calculate the number of tents:
     - `b // 3` gives the number of full tents needed for extroverts.
     - `-b // 3` ensures that if `b` is negative, it rounds towards zero.
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed, considering both introverts and extroverts.
     - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If `c` is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `b % 3` is non-zero and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - It correctly handles the case where there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`), outputting `0`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
