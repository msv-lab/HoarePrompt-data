To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is the first element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input.
2. `a` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`.
3. `b` is now equal to the original value of `b` plus the value of `c`.
4. `c` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `s` and Splitting:**
   - `s` is a string obtained from the second line of the standard input.
   - `a` and `c` are integers derived from splitting and converting `s`.

2. **Understanding `b`:**
   - `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus the value of `c`.

3. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a - -b // 3`: This part of the expression involves the integer division of `-b` by 3, negated, and then subtracted from `a`.
     - `b % 3`: This is the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
     - `c < b % 3`: This is a boolean expression that checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a conditional expression that returns `a - -b // 3` if `c < b % 3` is `True`, otherwise it returns `-1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for clarity:
- `s = "10 20"`
- Original `b = 5`

1. **Splitting and Converting `s`:**
   - `a = 10`
   - `c = 20`

2. **Updating `b`:**
   - `b = 5 + 20 = 25`

3. **Evaluating the Expression:**
   - `b % 3 = 25 % 3 = 1`
   - `c < b % 3` becomes `20 < 1`, which is `False`.
   - Therefore, the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` evaluates to `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
