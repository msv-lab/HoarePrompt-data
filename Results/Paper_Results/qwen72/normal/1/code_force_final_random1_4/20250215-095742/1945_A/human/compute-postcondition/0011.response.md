To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is the third element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input, and the file must have at least three lines starting from the second line onward.
2. `a` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`.
3. `b` is now equal to the original value of `b` plus the value of `c` before the assignment, plus twice the new value of `c` obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`.
4. `c` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading the Input:**
   - The third line of the input is read and stored in `s`.
   - For example, if the input file looks like this:
     ```
     Line 1
     Line 2
     10 20 30
     Line 4
     ```
     Then `s` would be `"10 20 30"`.

2. **Splitting and Converting `s`:**
   - `s` is split into a list of strings: `["10", "20", "30"]`.
   - These strings are converted to integers: `[10, 20, 30]`.

3. **Assigning Values to `a` and `c`:**
   - Let's assume `a` is assigned the first integer from the split list, so `a = 10`.
   - Let's assume `c` is assigned the second integer from the split list, so `c = 20`.

4. **Updating `b`:**
   - `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus the original value of `c` plus twice the new value of `c`.
   - Let's assume the original values were `b = 5` and `c = 15`.
   - After the update, `b = 5 + 15 + 2 * 20 = 5 + 15 + 40 = 60`.

5. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - First, evaluate `b % 3`:
     - `b % 3 = 60 % 3 = 0`.
   - Next, evaluate `c < b % 3`:
     - `c < 0` is `20 < 0`, which is `False`.
   - Since `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to the second element of the tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`, which is `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
