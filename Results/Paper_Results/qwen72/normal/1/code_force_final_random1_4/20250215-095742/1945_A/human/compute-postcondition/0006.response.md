The value of `b` is updated by adding the current value of `c` to it. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged, and `s` remains the second element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, `b` is now equal to the original value of `b` plus the value of `c` before the assignment, plus the current value of `c`, and `c` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`. `s` is the second element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input.**
