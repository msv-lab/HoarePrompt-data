The function reads lines from the standard input starting from the second line. For each line, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` represents the number of introverts, `b` represents the number of extroverts, and `c` represents the number of universals. It then adds the value of `c` to `b` and prints a result based on the condition `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `c` hold the values from the last line processed, and `b` holds the sum of the original value of `b` and all values of `c` encountered during the iterations. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output.
