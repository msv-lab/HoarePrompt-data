Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Universal Participants (c):**
   - The solution adds `c` to `b` directly (`b += c`). This assumes that all universals can be used to fill the requirement of extroverts. However, this is not always optimal. For example, if there are more universals than needed to fill the extroverts' requirements, some universals might be better off living alone or in pairs.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to calculate the number of tents. This is problematic:
     - `- -b // 3` is equivalent to `b // 3`, which calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts.
     - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents. However, this does not account for the possibility of having leftover universals that need to be accommodated.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution does not handle edge cases well, such as when there are no participants at all (`a = b = c = 0`), or when there are more introverts than can be accommodated without violating the extroverts' requirements.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve the following steps:
1. **Accommodate Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent.
2. **Accommodate Extroverts:** Try to use universals to fill the extroverts' requirements. If there are not enough universals, check if it's possible to form groups of 3 with the remaining participants.
3. **Handle Remaining Universals:** After accommodating introverts and extroverts, check how many tents are needed for the remaining universals.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Introverts need their own tents
        tents = a
        
        # Extroverts need 3 people per tent
        if b > 0:
            if c >= b % 3:
                c -= b % 3
                tents += b // 3
            else:
                c = 0
                if b % 3 != 0:
                    if c == 0:
                        results.append(-1)
                        continue
                    else:
                        c -= 1
                        tents += 1
                tents += b // 3
        
        # Remaining universals
        if c > 0:
            tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all participants are accommodated according to their preferences and handles edge cases correctly.
