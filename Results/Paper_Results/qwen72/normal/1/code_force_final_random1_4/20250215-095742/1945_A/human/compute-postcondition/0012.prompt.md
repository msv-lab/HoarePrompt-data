Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, `b` is now equal to the original value of `b` plus the value of `c`, and `c` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`. `s` is the first element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input, implying that the standard input has at least two lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, `b` is now equal to the original value of `b` plus the value of `c` before the assignment, plus the current value of `c`, and `c` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`. `s` is the second element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, `b` is now equal to the original value of `b` plus the value of `c` before the assignment, plus twice the new value of `c` obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, and `c` is an integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`. `s` is the third element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input, and the file must have at least three lines starting from the second line onward.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
