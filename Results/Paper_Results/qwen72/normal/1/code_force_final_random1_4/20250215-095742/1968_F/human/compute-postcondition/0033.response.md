Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a[3]` is `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` is a list containing `[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `a[3]` remains `int(data[idx-1])`.
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `pf[3]` remains `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.
- Since `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, `mp[pf[3]]` is initialized as an empty list and then `3` is appended to it, making `mp[pf[3]]` a list containing `[3]`.
