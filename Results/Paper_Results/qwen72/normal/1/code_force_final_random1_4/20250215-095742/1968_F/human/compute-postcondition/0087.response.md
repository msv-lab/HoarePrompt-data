Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
