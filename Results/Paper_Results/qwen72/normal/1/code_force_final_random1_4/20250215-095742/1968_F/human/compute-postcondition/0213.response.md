Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` contains 'YES' as its last element. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO' as its last element.***
