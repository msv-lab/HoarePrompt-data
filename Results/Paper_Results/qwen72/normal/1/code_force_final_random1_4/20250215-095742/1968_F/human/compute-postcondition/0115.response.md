The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, the key points are:
- `q` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is not initialized but will be handled by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `q` is greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be explicitly stated since it is managed by the loop.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
