Output State: **`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `q` remains greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1.
- `l` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`.
- `r` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `idx` is incremented by 2.
- `x` is assigned the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
