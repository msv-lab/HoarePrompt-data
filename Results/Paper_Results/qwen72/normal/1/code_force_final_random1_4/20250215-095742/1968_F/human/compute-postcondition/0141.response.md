Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `x` is 0, `results` now includes 'YES' at the end, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` updates the value of `v1` to the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`.
- All other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for adding 'YES' to `results` and continuing to the next iteration or statement remains the same as in the initial state.
