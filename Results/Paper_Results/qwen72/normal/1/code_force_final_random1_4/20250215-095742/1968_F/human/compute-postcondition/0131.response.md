The code snippet `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation modifies the `results` list but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. Either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`. `results` now includes the string 'NO'.**
