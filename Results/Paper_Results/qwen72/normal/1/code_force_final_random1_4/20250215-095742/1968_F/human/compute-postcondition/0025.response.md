Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be greater than 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and `a[2]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `pf[1]` which is now `a[1]` and `pf[2]` which is now `a[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], (a[1]): [1]}`. If `pf[2]` (which is `a[1] ^ a[2]`) is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include the key-value pair `(a[1] ^ a[2]): []`. In all cases, `i` remains 2.***
