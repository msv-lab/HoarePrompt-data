The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume this is part of an ongoing loop structure. The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement itself.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is 0, and `results` now contains the string 'YES'. The program moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
