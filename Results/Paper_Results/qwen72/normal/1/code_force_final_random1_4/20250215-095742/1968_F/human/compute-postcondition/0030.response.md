The value of `pf[i]` is updated to the result of the XOR operation between `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `pf[3]` is set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`. The value of `a[3]` is `int(data[idx-1])`, and `idx` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and the fact that `idx` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a[3]` is `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.**
