Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` is zero or if there exists a pair of indices within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR value. If either condition is met, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, with each result on a new line, and an additional empty line after each test case. **
