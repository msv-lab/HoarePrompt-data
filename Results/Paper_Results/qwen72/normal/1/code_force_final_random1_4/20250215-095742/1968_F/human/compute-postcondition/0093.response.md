Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q + 2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string.**
