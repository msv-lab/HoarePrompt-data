Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 3`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1.
- The initial state indicates that `idx` was already incremented by `2 * q_initial + 2`. After the increment, `idx` is now incremented by `2 * q_initial + 3`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
