Postcondition: ***`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 5`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is now `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is now `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2], pf[3]: [3]}` if `pf[3]` is in `mp`. If `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` is an empty list, and `i` is 3.***
