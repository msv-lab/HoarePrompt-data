Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and `a[2]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`, the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `pf[1]` which is now `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], (a[1]): [1]}`, `i` is 2.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `a[2]` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
