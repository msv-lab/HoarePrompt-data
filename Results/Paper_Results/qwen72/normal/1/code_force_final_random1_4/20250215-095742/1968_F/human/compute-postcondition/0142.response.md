Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` updates the value of `v2` to the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for adding 'YES' to `results` and the continuation to the next iteration or statement are not affected by this line of code.
