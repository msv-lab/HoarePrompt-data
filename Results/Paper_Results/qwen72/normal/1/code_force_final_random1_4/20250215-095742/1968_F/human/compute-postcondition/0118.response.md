Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2.** 

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, while the conditions for `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, but their references to `data` are now shifted by 2 indices backward.
