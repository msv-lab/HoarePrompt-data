Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 4`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is now `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1]}`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[2]` to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[1]` and `a[2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
