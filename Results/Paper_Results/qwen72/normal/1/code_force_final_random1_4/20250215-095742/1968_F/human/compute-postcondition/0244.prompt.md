Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `q` remains the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + n + 1`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` before the loop started, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n]` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data[idx]` as the loop iterated, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `pf[1]` to `pf[n]` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those `pf` values occur, and `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` contains 'YES' as its last element. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO' as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order minus 1. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` now includes 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'NO'. The program continues to the next iteration in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order minus 1. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, then `results` now includes 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
