Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q + 2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mp = {(0): [0]}` updates the dictionary `mp` to contain a single key-value pair where the key is `0` and the value is a list `[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `i`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
