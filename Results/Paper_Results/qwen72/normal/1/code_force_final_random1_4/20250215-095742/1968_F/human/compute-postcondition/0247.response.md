Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process.
- `idx` has been incremented by the total number of elements processed in `data`, which is the sum of `n + 1 + 2 * q` for each test case.
- `results` is a list that contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an empty string for each test case.

Given this information, the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all the elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and print them.

### Explanation:
- Each element in `results` is either 'YES', 'NO', or an empty string.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` operation will concatenate these elements into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character.
- This means that each 'YES', 'NO', or empty string will appear on a new line in the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **(Each 'YES', 'NO', or empty string from the `results` list, each on a new line)**

For example, if `results` contains `['YES', 'NO', '', 'YES']`, the output will be:
```
YES
NO

YES
```
