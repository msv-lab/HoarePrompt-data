Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string.**
