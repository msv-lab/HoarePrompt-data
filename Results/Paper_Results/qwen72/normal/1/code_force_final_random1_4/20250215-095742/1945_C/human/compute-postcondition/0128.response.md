The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` (which is the second element in `lst`) to the list `final`.

Given the initial state:
- `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
- `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop.
- `lst` must have at least two elements.
- `elem` is the second element in `lst`.
- All other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.
- `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `final` now contains the second element of `lst` (`elem`).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `lst` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, all other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged, and `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst`.**
