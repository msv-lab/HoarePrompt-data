To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`.

### Analysis:
1. **`ele`**: This variable will take on the values from `lst` during each iteration of the loop.
2. **`lst`**: This is the list that `ele` iterates over. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `s` is an input string.
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`.
- If `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`.
- If `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`.
- `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`.
- `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`.
- `mini` is 100,000,000.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`.
- `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`.
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`.
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`.
- `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`lst`**: For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The current state does not guarantee this, so we need to ensure that `lst` is not empty.
- **`ele`**: This will be set to the elements of `lst` as the loop runs, so no adjustment is needed for `ele` itself.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `lst` is not empty. The other variables remain as they are because they do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` must contain at least one element**.
