The value of `one` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is an empty list unless `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, in which case `lst` is `[1]`. `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `one` is 1 (if `s[0]` is '1') or 2 (if `s[0]` is '0'), `zero` is 0 (if `s[0]` is '1') or 1 (if `s[0]` is '0'), `zero_perc` is 0 (if `s[0]` is '1') or 100 (if `s[0]` is '0'), `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`) remain unchanged.**
