The code snippet `zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)` calculates the percentage of zeros encountered so far in the string `s` up to the current index `i`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `zero` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '0'.
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1.
- The calculation `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` simplifies to `zero * 100 // 1`, which is simply `zero * 100`.

Therefore, `zero_perc` will be 0 if the character at index `i` is not '0', and 100 if the character at index `i` is '0'.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0.**
