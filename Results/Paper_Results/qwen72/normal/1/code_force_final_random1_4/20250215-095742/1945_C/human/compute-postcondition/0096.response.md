The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1**
