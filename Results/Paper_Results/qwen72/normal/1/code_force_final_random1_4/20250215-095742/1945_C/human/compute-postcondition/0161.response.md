Postcondition: ***`o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.***
