The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

- Initial State: `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0. `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. The current value of `zero_perc` is at least 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is at least 50.

- Impact of the Code: The value of `i + 1` (which is 1) is appended to `lst`.

- Updated Values:
  - `lst` now contains the value 1, so `lst` is `[1]`.

- Unchanged Values:
  - `o` remains the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`.
  - `z` remains the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`.
  - `mini` remains 100000000.
  - `n` remains at least 2.
  - `i` remains 0.
  - All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.
  - If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0.
  - `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
  - The current value of `zero_perc` is at least 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is at least 50.

Output State: **`o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is `[1]`, `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0. `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. The current value of `zero_perc` is at least 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is at least 50.**
