To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `n - 1` must be greater than 2.
   - This implies that `n` must be greater than 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 2, and `zero_perc` is 0. In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)`. `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // 2`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
