### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `pk` is set to `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is correct because the goal is to find the position closest to the middle of the village.
   - The list `sl` is created from the string `s`, and the counts of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`) are calculated. These counts are used to determine the percentages later.

3. **Iterating Through Houses**:
   - The function iterates through the houses from 0 to `n-2` (i.e., `range(n-1)`). This is correct because the road can be placed between any two houses or before the first house or after the last house.
   - It maintains a running count of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) encountered so far.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side (`zero_perc`) and the percentage of '1's on the right side (`one_perc`).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, the position `i+1` is added to the list `lst`. This ensures that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function then finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk` (the middle of the village). This is done by calculating the absolute difference `abs(pk - ele)` for each element `ele` in `lst` and keeping track of the minimum difference.
   - If multiple positions have the same distance to `pk`, the smallest one is chosen by sorting the list `final`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no valid positions are found in `lst`, the function checks if the entire village can be declared as one side (either all '1's or all '0's). If more than 50% of the residents are satisfied, it outputs 0; otherwise, it outputs `n`. This handles the edge cases where no valid split can be found.

### Analysis:
- The logic for counting '0's and '1's and checking the conditions is correct.
- The approach to find the optimal position by minimizing the distance to `pk` is also correct.
- The edge case handling for when no valid positions are found is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
