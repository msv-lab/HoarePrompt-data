Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 1`, `one_perc` is `(n - one) * 100 // (n - 1)`. Additionally, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**
