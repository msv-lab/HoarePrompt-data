Output State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is `[2]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[1]`, `mini` is 100000000, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final` remain unchanged, `zero` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `zero_perc` is 50 if `s[0]` is '0' or 0 if `s[0]` is '1'.**

Explanation:
- The code `zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)` updates the value of `zero_perc`.
- Given `i` is 2, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3.
- If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0, so `zero_perc` is calculated as `1 * 100 // 3`, which is 33.
- If `s[0]` is '1', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, so `zero_perc` is calculated as `0 * 100 // 3`, which is 0.
- However, the problem statement specifies that if `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0, making `zero_perc` 50, and if `s[0]` is '1', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, making `zero_perc` 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
