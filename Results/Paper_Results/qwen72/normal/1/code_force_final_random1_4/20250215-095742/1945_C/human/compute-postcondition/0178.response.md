Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, where `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`. `lst` is `[2]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[1]`. `mini` is 100000000, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, and `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final` remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1, and `one` is 0, making `zero_perc` 50. If `s[0]` is '1', `zero` is 0, and `one` is 1, making `zero_perc` 0. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1, `one` remains 0, and `zero_perc` is 50. If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is incremented by 1, `zero` remains 0, and `zero_perc` is 0.***
