Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
- For each element `elem` in `lst`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- If the condition is met, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.
- After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
