The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is an empty list unless `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, in which case `lst` is `[1]`. `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, and all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0. `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.**
