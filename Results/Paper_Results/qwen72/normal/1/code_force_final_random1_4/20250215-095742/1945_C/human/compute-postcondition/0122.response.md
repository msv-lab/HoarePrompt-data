Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` will be the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `final`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged, except `final` which is now an empty list.**
