Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `zero` will be the number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last element of `s`, `one` will be the number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last element of `s`, `zero_perc` will be the percentage of '0's encountered so far, `one_perc` will be the percentage of remaining '1's, `lst` will contain indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `i` will be `n-2`, and `mini` will remain 100000000. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `o`, `z`, `n`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must contain at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must contain at least two indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` must contain at least three indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
