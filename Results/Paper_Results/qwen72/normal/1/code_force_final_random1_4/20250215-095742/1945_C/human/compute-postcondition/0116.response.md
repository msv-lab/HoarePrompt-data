The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is the first element of `lst`, and `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is a valid value from `lst`. The states of `lst` and `ele` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**
