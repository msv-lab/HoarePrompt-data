The value of `one` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `one` is either 0 or 2 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`, after incrementing `one` by 1, `one` will be either 1 or 3. The rest of the conditions and values specified in the initial state remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 3, and `zero_perc` is 0. In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)`. `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // 2`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
