The code snippet `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Given the initial state:

- `lst` must contain at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.
- `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

Let's assume `mini` had an initial value before this line of code was executed. After executing the code, the value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.
