Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is sorted in ascending order and contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, if `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the value 0, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes the value `n`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1. If the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1; otherwise, `one` is increased by 1. `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 1`, and `one_perc` is `(n - one) * 100 // (n - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 50`, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains `[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, `zero` is `zero`, `one` is `one`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 3)`, and `lst` remains unchanged unless `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, in which case `lst` now includes the value `3` at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
