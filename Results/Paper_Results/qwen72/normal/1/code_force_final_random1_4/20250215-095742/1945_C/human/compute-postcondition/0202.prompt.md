Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. The variable `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst`. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `final`, `o`, `z`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`) remain unchanged, except `final` which is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element, `final` is an empty list if `abs(pk - elem)` is not equal to `mini`. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least two elements. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`. Otherwise, `final` is an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, and `lst` must have at least three elements. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`, and `elem` has been appended to `final`. Otherwise, `final` is an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
