To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`.

### Analysis:
- **`ele`**: This variable will take on the values from the list `lst` during each iteration of the loop.
- **`lst`**: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n - 2`.
- `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`.
- `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`.
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`.
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`.
- `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution.
- The other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.
- The value of `ele` will be the first element of `lst` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `lst`**
