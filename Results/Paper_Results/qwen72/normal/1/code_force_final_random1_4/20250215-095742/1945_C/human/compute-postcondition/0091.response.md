Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `zero * 100 // 1`, which is simply `zero * 100`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the conditions for updating `zero` or `one` remain unchanged.
