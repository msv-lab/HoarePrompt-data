Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 50`, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains `[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.***
