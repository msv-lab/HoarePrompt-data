The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Since `s[i]` was '0', `zero` was already increased by 1 before this operation, and now it is increased again. The values of `i`, `n`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` remain as they were, except for the updated value of `zero`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 50`, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains `[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.**
