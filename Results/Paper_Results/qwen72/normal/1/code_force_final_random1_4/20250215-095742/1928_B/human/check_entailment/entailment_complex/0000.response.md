### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of elements in an array `a` that can be made equal by adding a permutation `p` to `a`.
   - The permutation `p` is a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The algorithm reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then sorts the unique elements of `a` and iterates through these elements to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The key idea is to use the `bisect_left` function to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array `arr`. The difference between this position and the current index `i` gives the count of elements that can be made equal.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads an integer from the input. Used to read the number of test cases and the length of the array.
   - **func_3**: Reads a list of integers from the input. Used to read the array `a`.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The main logic correctly reads the input, processes the array, and uses `bisect_left` to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
     - The logic of using `bisect_left` to find the position and calculating the difference is correct for the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as small and large arrays, and arrays with repeated elements.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates and `sorted` to sort the array ensures that the algorithm works correctly for all valid inputs.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to 2 * 10^5 elements per test case and up to 2 * 10^4 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution for the problem described. It reads the input, processes the array, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
