Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The functions defined do not address the core logic required to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. The functions `func_1` through `func_7` are for input handling, and `func_8` and `func_9` compute products of elements in an array, which is unrelated to the problem of adding permutations and finding the most frequent element. The solution should involve logic to simulate the addition of a permutation and then count the frequency of the resulting elements to find the maximum.
