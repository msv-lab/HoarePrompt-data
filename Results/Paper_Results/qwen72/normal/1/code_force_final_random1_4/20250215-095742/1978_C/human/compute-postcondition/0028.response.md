Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1 - i + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)`, `c` is 3. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(3, l)`. If `k` is not 0 and `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`. Otherwise, if `k` is not 0 and `k >= i - 1`, the program does not return anything explicitly.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - i + 1`.
- The initial value of `k` was `k - (n - 2) + 1`, so after the update, `k` becomes `k - (n - 2) + 1 - i + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for returning values based on the value of `k` remain the same.
