### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, the program should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_4:** This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. It returns `(n, k)` if valid, otherwise `(0, 0)`.
     - The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct.
     - The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \(\frac{n^2}{2}\) for even `n` and \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) for odd `n`.

   - **func_1:** This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It initializes a list `l` to `[1, 2, ..., n]` and modifies it to achieve the required Manhattan value.
     - The function iterates backward through the list and performs swaps to reduce the Manhattan value.
     - The logic for reducing the Manhattan value by swapping elements is complex and needs careful verification.

   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions are helper functions used by `func_1` to swap elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - The logic in these functions seems to be correct but needs to be verified in the context of `func_1`.

   - **func_5:** This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
     - The function is straightforward and appears to be correct.

   - **func_6:** This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get valid `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally calls `func_5` to print the result.
     - The function handles the output and orchestration correctly.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **func_4:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct.
   - **func_1:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, the logic for adjusting the Manhattan value by swapping elements is not straightforward and may not always produce the correct result.
     - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not correctly handle all edge cases.
     - The function `func_1` needs to ensure that the swaps it makes do not violate the constraints of the permutation (i.e., all elements must be unique and within the range `[1, n]`).

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation might not always produce the correct result, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not correctly handle all edge cases, leading to incorrect permutations or failure to find a valid permutation when one exists.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the construction logic of `func_1`, the provided program may not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
