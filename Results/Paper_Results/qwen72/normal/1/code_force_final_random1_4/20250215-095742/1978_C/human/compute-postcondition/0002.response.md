The print statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or objects; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Based on the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers assigned by `func_4()`.
- The constraints are 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
- The current value of `n` is 0.

However, the print statement itself does not use these variables or their values. It only prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
