The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range parameters `n` and `-1`, with the step being `-2`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` as it is directly involved in the loop's condition.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 2 according to the step value of the loop. Thus, `i` becomes `n - 4`.

The other conditions (`n` being a positive integer, `k` being `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` being the result of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` being 2, and `k` not being 0 and being greater than or equal to 1) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and are not modified by the loop itself.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, and `k` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
