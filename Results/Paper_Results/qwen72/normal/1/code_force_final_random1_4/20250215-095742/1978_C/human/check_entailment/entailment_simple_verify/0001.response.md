### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, the program should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_4:** This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. It returns `(n, k)` if valid, otherwise `(0, 0)`.
     - The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \(\frac{n^2}{2}\) for even `n` and \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) for odd `n`.
   - **func_1:** This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It uses a list `l` initialized to `[1, 2, ..., n]` and modifies it to achieve the required Manhattan value.
     - The function iterates over the list in reverse steps of 2, decrementing `k` and swapping elements to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - The logic for adjusting the Manhattan value by swapping elements is complex and needs careful verification.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - The logic in these functions seems to be correct but needs to be carefully verified.
   - **func_5 and func_6:** These functions handle the output and orchestration, which appear to be correct.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **func_4:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct.
   - **func_1:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, the logic for adjusting the Manhattan value by swapping elements is not straightforward and may not always produce the correct result.
     - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not correctly handle all edge cases.
     - The function `func_1` iterates over the list in reverse steps of 2, decrementing `k` and swapping elements to adjust the Manhattan value. This approach is designed to reduce `k` by the largest possible amount in each step, which is a good strategy but needs to be verified for all edge cases.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps to adjust the Manhattan value. The logic here seems to be correct but needs to be carefully verified.
   - **func_5 and func_6:** These functions handle the output and orchestration, which appear to be correct.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation might not always produce the correct result, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not correctly handle all edge cases.
   - The function `func_1` might fail to construct a valid permutation in some cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the construction logic of `func_1`, the provided program may not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
