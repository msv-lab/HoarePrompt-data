### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case using the `func_6()` function.
   - `func_4()` reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case and performs initial validation:
     - It checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
     - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
       - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
       - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
     - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
     - Otherwise, it returns the valid `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Generation:**
   - `func_1(n, k)` generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`:
     - It initializes a list `l` with the first `n` natural numbers.
     - It iterates over the list in reverse steps of 2, adjusting the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - If `k` becomes zero during the process, it returns the current permutation.
     - If `k` is still greater than zero but less than the next step size, it calls `func_2(c, k, l)` to make the final adjustments.
     - It continues to swap elements using `func_3(c, l)` until `k` is reduced to zero or no more swaps can be made.

3. **Swapping Functions:**
   - `func_2(c, k, l)` swaps elements at specific positions to reduce `k` by a smaller amount.
   - `func_3(c, l)` swaps elements at specific positions to reduce `k` by a larger amount.

4. **Output:**
   - `func_5(l)` prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - If no valid permutation is found, `func_6()` prints "NO".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and validation steps.
- The permutation generation logic in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by making strategic swaps.
- The swapping functions `func_2` and `func_3` are used appropriately to adjust the permutation.
- The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
