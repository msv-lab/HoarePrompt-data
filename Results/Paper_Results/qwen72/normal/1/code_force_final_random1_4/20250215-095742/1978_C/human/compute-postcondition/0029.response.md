Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1 - i + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)`, `c` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = func_3(c, l)` updates the value of `l` to the result of calling `func_3(3, l)`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for returning a value from the program are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
