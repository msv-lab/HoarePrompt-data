Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` is 3, and `i` is `n - 4`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(3, l)`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and the program does not return anything explicitly.***
