The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`. It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l` and returns the modified list. The new value at index `-c` is the original value at index `-c - k`, and the new value at index `-c - k` is the original value at index `-c`. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
