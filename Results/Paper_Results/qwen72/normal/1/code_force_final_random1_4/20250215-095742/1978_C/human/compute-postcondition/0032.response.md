Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing a required Manhattan value. The function modifies the list `l`, which initially contains integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. Depending on the value of `k`, the function may return the list `l` directly, or it may return the result of calling `func_2` or `func_3` with specific parameters. Specifically, the function can return `l` unchanged, the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, or the result of `func_3(c, l)`, where `c` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. The final state of the program is such that `l` is either the original list or a modified version of it, and `k` is reduced to a value that no longer satisfies the conditions for further loop execution. **
