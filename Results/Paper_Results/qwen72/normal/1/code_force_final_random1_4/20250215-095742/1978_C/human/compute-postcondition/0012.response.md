Output State: **The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^12. Additionally, `max_k` is set to `n` regardless of whether `n` is odd or even, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
