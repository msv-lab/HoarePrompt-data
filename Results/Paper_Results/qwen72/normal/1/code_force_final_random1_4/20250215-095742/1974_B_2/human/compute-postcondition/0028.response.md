Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string. This new string contains all characters from the original `s`, including duplicates, in the order they were encountered. The function modifies the input string `s` during its execution, but the final returned string is a concatenation of all characters from the original `s`, preserving their order. **
