Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**: The encoding process involves creating a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list. For example, if `s = "codeforces"`, the sorted unique characters are `"cdefors"`. The first character `'c'` is replaced by `'s'`, the second character `'o'` is replaced by `'e'`, and so on.

2. **Decoding Process**: To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. We should create the same sorted list of unique characters and then replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s`.
   - **Step 2**: It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the unique characters list, respectively.
   - **Step 3**: It iterates over each character in the input string `s`:
     - If the character is in the unique characters list, it replaces the character in `s` with the corresponding symmetric character from the list and decrements `j`.
     - If the character is not in the unique characters list, it inserts the character into the unique characters list and increments both `i` and `j`.
   - **Step 4**: It returns the modified unique characters list as a string.

5. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The logic inside the loop is incorrect. The program attempts to replace characters in the input string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
   - The program also modifies the `unique_chars` list during iteration, which is not necessary and can cause issues.
   - The final return statement should return the decoded string, not the modified `unique_chars` list.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - Create a mapping from each character in the unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Use this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

Given the issues identified, the program is indeed incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly decode the string as intended. The logic for replacing characters and handling the unique characters list is flawed.

Final: **False**
