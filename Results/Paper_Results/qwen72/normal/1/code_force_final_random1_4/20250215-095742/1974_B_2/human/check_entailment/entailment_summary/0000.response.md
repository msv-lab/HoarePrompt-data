Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1` that prevent it from correctly performing the decoding as described in the problem statement.

1. **Incorrect Logic for Decoding**: The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with characters from the `unique_chars` list, but it does so in a way that doesn't match the encoding process. Specifically, the encoding process involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters. The current implementation incorrectly manipulates the `unique_chars` list and the string `s` in a way that does not achieve this.

2. **Modification of `unique_chars` List**: The function incorrectly inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which should remain a sorted list of unique characters from the input string. This insertion logic is unnecessary and disrupts the intended decoding process.

3. **String Replacement Logic**: The function uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` inside a loop, which replaces all occurrences of `char` in the string `s` with `unique_chars[j]`. This is not the correct approach because it modifies the entire string `s` at once, rather than processing each character individually.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the `unique_chars` list from the input string.
- Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
- Use this mapping to construct the decoded string by replacing each character in the input string with its corresponding character from the mapping.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
