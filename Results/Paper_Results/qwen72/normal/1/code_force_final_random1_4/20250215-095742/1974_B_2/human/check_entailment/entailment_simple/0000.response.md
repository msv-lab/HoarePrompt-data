Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string according to the specified algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Character Replacement**: The function `func_1` tries to replace characters in the string `s` by iterating through `s` and replacing each character with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` in reverse order. However, the logic for updating `unique_chars` and the replacement process is flawed. Specifically, the `else` block inside the loop is unnecessary and incorrect because it modifies `unique_chars` in a way that does not align with the encoding/decoding algorithm.

2. **Incorrect Final String Construction**: The final return statement constructs a string from `unique_chars`, which is not the intended decoded string. The decoded string should be constructed by replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop iterates through each character in `s` and attempts to replace it, but it does not correctly handle the symmetric replacement. The `j` index is decremented without properly managing the replacement for each character.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
