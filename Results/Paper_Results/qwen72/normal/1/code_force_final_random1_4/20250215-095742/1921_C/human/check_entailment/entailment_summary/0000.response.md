### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It parses the input values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of moments `arr`.

2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the charge loss for each interval between consecutive messages.
   - It checks if the interval between two messages is less than the threshold `b / a`. If it is, it adds the charge loss for that interval to `array2`.
   - The total charge loss is calculated as the sum of the charge losses in `array2` plus the charge loss for turning the phone off and on for the remaining intervals.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - The function compares the total charge loss with the initial charge `f`.
   - If the total charge loss is less than or equal to `f`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the number of messages is 1 by defaulting to the condition where the phone can always send the message if the initial charge is sufficient.
   - The function also handles large inputs and ensures that the calculations do not overflow by using integer arithmetic.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The function optimizes the charge calculation by only considering intervals where the charge loss per unit time is significant (`arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`).

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for determining whether Stepan can send all messages based on the given constraints. The approach is sound and the implementation is efficient.

### Correctness:
**True**
