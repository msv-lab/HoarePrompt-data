### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and the list of moments `arr`.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge loss for intervals where the phone must remain on.
   - It iterates through the list of moments `arr` and checks if the interval between consecutive messages is less than `b / a`. If so, it appends the charge loss for that interval to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Loss Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the total charge loss for intervals where the phone must remain on by summing the elements in `array2`.
   - It also calculates the charge loss for turning the phone off and on for the remaining intervals by multiplying `(n - len(array2))` by `b`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The function checks if the total charge loss is less than the initial charge `f`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 (only one message to send).
   - It correctly handles large values of `f`, `a`, and `b` without causing integer overflow issues.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the total charge loss and compares it with the initial charge to determine if all messages can be sent.

### Correctness:
**True**
