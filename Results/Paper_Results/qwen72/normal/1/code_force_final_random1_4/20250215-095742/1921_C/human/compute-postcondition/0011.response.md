The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. This value is determined by the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of the list `arr`, multiplied by the value of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` is a list of integers from the input
- `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`
- `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`
- `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `array2` is an empty list
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`

After executing the code:
- `array2` now contains one element, which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `array2` is a list containing one element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.**
