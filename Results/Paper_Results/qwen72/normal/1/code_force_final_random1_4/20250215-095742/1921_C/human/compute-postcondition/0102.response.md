Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the state of `array2` and the conditions related to the elements of `arr` and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `i == 0`, which is not the case here, `array2` would contain the value `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`. Since `i` is 2, `array2` has a new element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` if `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`.***
