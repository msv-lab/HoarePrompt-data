### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It parses the input values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` correctly.
   - It also correctly reads the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the charge required to send messages between consecutive times if the phone remains on.
   - It checks if the difference between consecutive message times is less than the threshold `b / a`. If so, it adds the charge consumed during this period to `array2`.
   - The logic for calculating the total charge required is:
     - Sum of charges for periods where the phone remains on (`sum(array2)`).
     - Charge for turning the phone off and on for the remaining periods (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the total charge required is less than the initial charge `f`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as a single message or very large inputs within the constraints.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses floating-point division `b / a` to determine the threshold. This could potentially introduce precision issues, but given the constraints, it should be safe.
   - The program assumes that the phone can be turned off and on instantaneously, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly parses the input, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the correct results based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: **True****
