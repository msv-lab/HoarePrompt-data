Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `n` is greater than 0, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 0 and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.***
