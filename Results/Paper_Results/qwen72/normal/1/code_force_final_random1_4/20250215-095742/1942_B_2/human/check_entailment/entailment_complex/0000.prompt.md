Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[MOOO! - Doja Cat](https://soundcloud.com/amalaofficial/mooo)

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

# Annotated Program:
from collections import deque

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: _ is t-1, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element at index i is `mex - ar[i]` for each i from 0 to len(ar) - 1, i is -1, and mex is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set {n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` in their final states as described in the annotations.
