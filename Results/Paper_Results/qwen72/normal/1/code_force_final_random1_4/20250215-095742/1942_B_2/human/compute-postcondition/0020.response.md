To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` (from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`) is `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order.
- The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop completes.

### Understanding the Variables:
- `t` is the upper limit for the range of values.
- `n` is equal to `t`, so it represents the same value.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `mex` is calculated by subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order. This means if `ar = [a1, a2, a3, ..., ak]`, then `mex = t - a1 - a2 - a3 - ... - ak`.

### Constructing `res`:
- For each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, the element at index `i` in `res` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `t = 10`
- `ar = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

1. Calculate `mex`:
   - `mex = t - ar[3] - ar[2] - ar[1] - ar[0]`
   - `mex = 10 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 = 0`

2. Construct `res`:
   - `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 0 - 1 = -1`
   - `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 0 - 2 = -2`
   - `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 0 - 3 = -3`
   - `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 0 - 4 = -4`

So, `res` would be `[-1, -2, -3, -4]`.

### Print Statement:
The code `print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))` will print the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the example above, the output would be:
Output: **-1 -2 -3 -4**

However, since the exact values of `t` and `ar` are not provided, we can generalize the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **' '.join(str(mex - ar[i]) for i in range(len(ar))) (where mex is the result of subtracting all elements of ar from t in reverse order)**

This means the output will be a space-separated string of values, where each value is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
