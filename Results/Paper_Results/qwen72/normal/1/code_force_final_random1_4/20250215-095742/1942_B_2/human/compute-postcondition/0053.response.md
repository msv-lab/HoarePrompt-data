Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[-1]` and the element at index `i` which is now `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `mex` is specifically `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.
