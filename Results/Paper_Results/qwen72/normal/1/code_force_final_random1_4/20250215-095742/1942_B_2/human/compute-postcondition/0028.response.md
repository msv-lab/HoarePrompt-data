Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` holds true, meaning `ar[i]` is greater than 0.**
