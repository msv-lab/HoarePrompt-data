The code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the changes:

- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \ \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, initially set to `None` except for the last element and the element at index `i` which are both `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex` is updated based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not affect the current operation.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.

The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the element at index `i` in the list `res` to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is already `len(ar) - 3`, and the element at this index was previously set to `mex - ar[i]`, this operation does not change the value at `res[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]` and the element at index `i` which is also `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
