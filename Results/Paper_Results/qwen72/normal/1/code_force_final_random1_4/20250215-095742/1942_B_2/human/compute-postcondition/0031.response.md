To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` remains `n`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

### Adjustments:
- `i` should be decremented by 1 to `len(ar) - 2`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

### Updated State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` remains `n`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, and `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**.
