Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is -1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mex = n` updates the value of `mex` to be equal to the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update while keeping the rest of the initial conditions intact.
