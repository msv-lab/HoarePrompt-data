Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now `n`, and `i` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    res[i] = mex - ar[i]
    if mex > mex - ar[i]:
        mex = mex - ar[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]` (which implies `ar[i]` is positive), then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, res is a list of n elements initialized to None except for the last element which is now mex - ar[-1] and the element at index i which is now mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 2. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is 2, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, res is a list of n elements initialized to None except for the last element which is now mex - ar[-1] and the element at index i which is now mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 3. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[i]. Otherwise, mex remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
