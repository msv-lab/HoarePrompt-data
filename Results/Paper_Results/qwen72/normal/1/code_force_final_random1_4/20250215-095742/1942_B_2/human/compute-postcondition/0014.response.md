Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, all other elements are `None`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`. Otherwise, the values of `mex` and `i` remain unchanged.***
