The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar`, and `i` is -1.**
