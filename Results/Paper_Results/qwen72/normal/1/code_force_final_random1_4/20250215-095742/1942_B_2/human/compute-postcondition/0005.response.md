To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `ar`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(ar) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - This means `len(ar)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `ar` has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should be set to `len(ar) - 1` at the start of the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, and it must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`.
- `mex` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is set to `len(ar) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is equal to `t`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
