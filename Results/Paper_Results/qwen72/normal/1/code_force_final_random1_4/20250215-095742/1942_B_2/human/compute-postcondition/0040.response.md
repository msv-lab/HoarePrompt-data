To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers from the user input.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` (this value is computed as the loop progresses).
- `i` is -1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is a list of `n` elements.
   - Each element in `res` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list `ar`.
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar`.

2. **Understanding `mex`**:
   - `mex` is computed as the loop progresses, but the exact method of computation is not provided in the initial state. However, it is typically computed by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `ar`.

3. **Constructing `res`**:
   - The list `res` is constructed by iterating over the list `ar` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each element `ar[i]` in `ar`, the corresponding element in `res` is `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Printing `res`**:
   - The `print` statement converts each element in `res` to a string and joins them with a space.
   - The final output is a single string where each element of `res` is separated by a space.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `ar = [0, 2, 1]` and `mex` is computed as 3 (since 3 is the smallest non-negative integer not in `ar`).

- For `i = -1` (last element of `ar`), `ar[-1] = 1`, so `res[-1] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
- For `i = -2`, `ar[-2] = 2`, so `res[-2] = 3 - 2 = 1`.
- For `i = -3`, `ar[-3] = 0`, so `res[-3] = 3 - 0 = 3`.

Thus, `res = [3, 1, 2]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of `res` joined by spaces.

Output: **3 1 2**

This output is based on the example calculation. In general, the output will be the elements of `res` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list `ar`.

Output: **' '.join(str(mex - ar[i]) for i in range(n-1, -1, -1))** (where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `ar` and `n` is the length of `ar`).
