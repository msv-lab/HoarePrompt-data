The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the last element of the `res` list (since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`) with the value of `mex - ar[i]`. Here's the detailed output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` remains 0.
- `n` remains equal to `t`.
- `ar` remains a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element.
- `res` remains a list of `n` elements, each initially set to `None`, except for the last element which is now updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex` remains equal to `t`.
- `i` remains `len(ar) - 1`.

Therefore, the specific value of `res[i]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and all other elements are `None`, `mex` is equal to `t`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.**
