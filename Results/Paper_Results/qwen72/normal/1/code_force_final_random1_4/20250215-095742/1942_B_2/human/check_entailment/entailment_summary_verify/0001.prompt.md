You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` in their final states as described in the annotations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - We need to ensure that the reconstructed permutation `p` satisfies the given `a`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The algorithm starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a result array `res` with `None` values.
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the initial assumption that the MEX of the entire permutation is `n`.
   - It iterates through the array `a` in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The key idea is to reconstruct `p` by working backwards from the end of the array `a`.
   - By setting `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, we are effectively calculating the value of `p[i]` that would produce the given `a[i]`.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that the MEX is correctly adjusted as we move backwards through the array.
   - This approach ensures that the MEX calculation is consistent with the given `a` values.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where `a` might have negative values or small positive values.
   - The initialization of `mex` to `n` ensures that the MEX is always within the valid range of the permutation.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result is printed as a space-separated string of the reconstructed permutation `p`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given problem description. The logic and steps are sound and handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
