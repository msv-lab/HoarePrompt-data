Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `d1[2]` is 1.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n-1]` is 1.
- `y` is greater than `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0. This means that if a key is not present in `d1`, it will return 0.
- We know that `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, and `y` is greater than `x`.

### Steps to Determine the Output:
1. **Check the value of `d1[y]`**:
   - If `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is any other integer, `d1[y]` will be 0 (since the default value of `d1` is 0).

2. **Check the value of `d1[x]`**:
   - If `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is any other integer, `d1[x]` will be 0 (since the default value of `d1` is 0).

3. **Calculate `d1[y] - d1[x]`**:
   - If both `y` and `x` are 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If neither `y` nor `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `y` is greater than `x`, the only scenario where `d1[y] - d1[x]` could be non-zero is if `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2. However, since `y` is greater than `x`, `y` cannot be 2 if `x` is also an integer. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that neither `y` nor `x` is 2.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **0**
