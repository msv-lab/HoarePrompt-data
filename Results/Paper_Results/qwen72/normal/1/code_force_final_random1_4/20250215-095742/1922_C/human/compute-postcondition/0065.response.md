Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default values of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input. If the last `y` > last `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the last `y` â‰¤ last `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.***
