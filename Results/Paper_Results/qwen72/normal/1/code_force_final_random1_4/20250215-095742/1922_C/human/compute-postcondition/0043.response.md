To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Relevant Variables:**
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1, meaning `d2[n - 1] = 1`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers where `y <= x`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - When accessing `d2[y]`, if `y` is not a key in `d2`, it will return the default value of 0.
   - Similarly, when accessing `d2[x]`, if `x` is not a key in `d2`, it will return the default value of 0.
   - The only key in `d2` that is explicitly set is `n - 1`, which is 1.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `y == n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `x == n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - For any other values of `y` and `x`, `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

Given the conditions and the possible scenarios, the output will depend on the values of `y` and `x` relative to `n - 1`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[n - 1] = 1 and d2 defaults to 0 for other keys)**

To provide a more precise output:
- If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, Output: **1**
- If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, Output: **-1**
- If `y != n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, Output: **0**
- If `y == n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, Output: **0**
