To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `d1` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
   - `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Variables Involved:**
   - `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a dictionary or a list where `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are valid indices or keys.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, with `y <= x`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will print the difference between the values at indices `y` and `x` in the `d2` collection.

Since `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information:

- `d2[y]` is the value at index/key `y` in `d2`.
- `d2[x]` is the value at index/key `x` in `d2`.
- The print statement will output the result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

Given the lack of specific values for `d2`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is the value at index/key y in d2 and d2[x] is the value at index/key x in d2)**
