Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `n - 4`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 4.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. This means `d2[i]` now holds the sum of the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` and the value of `d2[i + 1]`.
