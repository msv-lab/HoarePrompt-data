Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**
