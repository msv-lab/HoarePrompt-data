Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `(l[i] - l[i - 1])` is greater than or equal to `(l[i + 1] - l[i])`, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `d2[i]` is updated to be the sum of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` and `d2[i + 1]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
