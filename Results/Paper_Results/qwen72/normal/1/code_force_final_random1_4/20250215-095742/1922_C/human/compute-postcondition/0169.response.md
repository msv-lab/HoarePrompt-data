The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of cities, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of n integers representing the positions of the cities, where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
  - `m`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
  - `queries`: A list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) representing the queries, where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

The function returns a list of results for each query, indicating the closest city to the city specified in the query. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and for each city, the closest city is unique.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It returns a list of results for each query, indicating the closest city to the specified city.**
