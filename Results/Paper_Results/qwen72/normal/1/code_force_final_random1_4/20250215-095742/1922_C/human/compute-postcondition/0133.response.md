Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[n - 1] = 1` sets the value of `d2[n - 1]` to 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
