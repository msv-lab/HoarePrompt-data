Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. For each index `i` from `n-2` down to 1, if the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input. If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input. If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the new integers provided by user input. If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the new `y` ≤ new `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
