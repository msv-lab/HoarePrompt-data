Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a new list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default values of 0, `d1[2]` is 1, and `d1[k]` (for each `k` from 4 to `n+1`) is either 1 or `l[k-1] - l[k-2] + d1[k-1]` depending on whether `l[k-1] - l[k-2] < l[k-2] - l[k-3]`. `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input. If the last `y` > last `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the last `y` â‰¤ last `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
