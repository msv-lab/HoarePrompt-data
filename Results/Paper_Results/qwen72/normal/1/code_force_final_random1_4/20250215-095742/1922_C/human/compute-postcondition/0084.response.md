To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is `n - 2`
  - `n` is greater than or equal to 3
  - `l` is a list of integers
  - The loop condition is `i` in the range from `n - 2` to `1` (inclusive), stepping backwards by 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be `n - 3`.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n - 3` must be greater than 0, which implies `n` must be greater than 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` must be greater than 3

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers.**
