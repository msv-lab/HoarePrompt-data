Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `l` is less than the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1`.**
