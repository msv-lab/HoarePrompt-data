Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + 1`, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The defaultdict `d1` now has an additional key-value pair `d1[3]` which is calculated as `l[2] - l[1] + 1`.
- The defaultdict `d2` remains unchanged.
