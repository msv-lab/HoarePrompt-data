To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `d1` is `0`.
   - `j` is `2`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
   - If `y` > `x`, the condition `y > x` holds true.
   - If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a dictionary or a list where `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are valid indices or keys.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, and their relationship (`y > x` or `y ≤ x`) is given.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will print the difference between the values at indices/keys `y` and `x` in `d2`.

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `d2`, `x`, and `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the provided conditions:

- If `y > x`, the output will be the difference between the value at index/key `y` and the value at index/key `x` in `d2`.
- If `y ≤ x`, the output will still be the difference between the value at index/key `y` and the value at index/key `x` in `d2`.

Since the exact values of `d2`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a dictionary or list, and x and y are integers provided by the user)**
