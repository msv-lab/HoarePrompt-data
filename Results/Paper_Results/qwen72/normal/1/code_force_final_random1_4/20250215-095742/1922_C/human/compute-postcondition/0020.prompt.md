Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between the first element of `l` and the element before it (which is undefined because `i - 1` is out of bounds, but the condition is still true), then no changes are made to `d1` or `d2`. Otherwise, `d1[2]` is updated to `l[1] - l[0] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = 2`. Otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0. If `l[3] - l[2] < l[2] - l[1]`, then `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3] = 2`, and `d1[4] = 3`. Otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + 1`, and `d1[4] = 2 + l[2] - l[1]` if the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true. If the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is false, then `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + 2` if `l[3] - l[2] < l[2] - l[1]`, otherwise `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + (l[2] - l[1] + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
