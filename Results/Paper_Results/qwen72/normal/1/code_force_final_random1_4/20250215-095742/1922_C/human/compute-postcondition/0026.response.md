Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, and the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
