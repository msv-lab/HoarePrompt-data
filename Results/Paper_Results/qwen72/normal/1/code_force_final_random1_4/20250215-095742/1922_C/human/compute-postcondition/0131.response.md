Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0. If the difference between the element at index 4 and the element at index 3 in the list `l` is less than the difference between the element at index 3 and the element at index 2, then `d1[3]` is 2, `d1[4]` is 2, and `d1[5]` is 3. Otherwise, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + 1`, and `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + (l[3] - l[2] + 1)`.***
