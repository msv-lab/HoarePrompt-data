The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation changes the values of `x` and `y` to the new values provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1. If `y` > `x`, the state remains unchanged. If `y` â‰¤ `x`, the state also remains unchanged.**
