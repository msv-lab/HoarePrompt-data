Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[n-3]` is 1 + `d2[n-2]`. Otherwise, if `l[i] - l[i - 1] >= l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[n-3]` is `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n-2]`.***
