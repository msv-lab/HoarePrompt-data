Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.** 

The code initializes a new defaultdict `d2` with default values of 0. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, and `d1`) remain unchanged.
