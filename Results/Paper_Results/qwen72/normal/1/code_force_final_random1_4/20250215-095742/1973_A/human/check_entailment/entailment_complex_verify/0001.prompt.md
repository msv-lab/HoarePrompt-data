You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats

t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each element in cas_de_test is a tuple of three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue

        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` remains a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The length of `cas_de_test` is equal to `t`. `resultats` is a list containing the results of the loop for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple (p_1, p_2, p_3) in `cas_de_test`, if the total points (p_1 + p_2 + p_3) is odd, or if the total matches (total points divided by 2) is greater than 3, or if the highest score (p_3) is greater than the total matches, or if the calculated number of ties (total points - 2 * (p_3 - p_2) - 2 * (p_3 - p_1)) is less than 0, then the corresponding entry in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the corresponding entry in `resultats` is the number of ties divided by 2.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 or a non-negative integer. If the conditions (total points being odd, total matches > 3, highest score > total matches, or calculated number of ties < 0) are met for a tuple, the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `cas_de_test` containing tuples of three integers each, representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It processes each tuple to determine the number of ties (draws) that could have occurred based on the given scores. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple, if the total points are odd, the total matches exceed 3, the highest score is greater than the total matches, or the calculated number of ties is negative, the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `cas_de_test` (a list of tuples representing the scores of the three players for each test case).

2. **Total Points Check**: 
   - The function calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - If the total points are not even (`total_points % 2 != 0`), it means the scores cannot be achieved by any combination of games (since each game results in either 2 points or 2 points from a draw), so the function appends `-1` to the results and continues to the next test case.

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - If the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches, it means the scores are not achievable, so the function appends `-1` to the results and continues to the next test case.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The function calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others should be accounted for by wins and draws.
   - If the number of draws (`egalites`) is negative, it means the scores are not achievable, so the function appends `-1` to the results.
   - Otherwise, the function appends the number of draws divided by 2 (`egalites // 2`) to the results.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results, which is then printed in the main part of the code.

### Correctness:
- The logic for checking the total points and total matches is correct.
- The formula for calculating the number of draws is also correct.
- The function handles all edge cases and invalid inputs correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
