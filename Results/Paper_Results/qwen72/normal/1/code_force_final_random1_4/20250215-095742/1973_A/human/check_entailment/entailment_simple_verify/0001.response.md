### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes `t` (the number of test cases) and `cas_de_test` (a list of tuples representing the scores of the three players for each test case).

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - If the total points are not even (`total_points % 2 != 0`), it correctly appends `-1` to the results and continues to the next test case. This is because the total points must be even, as each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points from a draw.

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - However, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is incorrect. The number of matches can be more than 3, and the highest score (`p3`) can be greater than the total number of matches. This condition should be removed or revised.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is intended to calculate the number of draws. However, this formula is not correct. The correct approach should consider the total points and the distribution of wins and draws.
   - A correct formula to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     - Let `total_wins` be the number of wins, which is `(total_points - 2 * egalites) / 2`.
     - The number of draws `egalites` should be maximized while ensuring that the total points and the distribution of wins and draws are consistent with the given scores.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results, which is then printed in the main part of the code.

### Correctness:
- The logic for checking the total points is correct.
- The formula for calculating the number of draws is incorrect.
- The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is incorrect and should be removed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (total_points - (p3 - p1) - (p3 - p2)) // 2
        
        if max_draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
        
    return resultats
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was partially correct but had issues with the formula for calculating the number of draws and an incorrect condition.
- The revised code addresses these issues and should correctly handle all test cases.

Final: **False**
