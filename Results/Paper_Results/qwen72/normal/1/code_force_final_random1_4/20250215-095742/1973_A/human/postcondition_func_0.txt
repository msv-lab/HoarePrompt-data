The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `cas_de_test` containing tuples of three integers each, representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It processes each tuple to determine the number of ties (draws) that could have occurred based on the given scores. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple, if the total points are odd, the total matches exceed 3, the highest score is greater than the total matches, or the calculated number of ties is negative, the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.
