Output State: **The program returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 or a non-negative integer. If the conditions (total points being odd, total matches > 3, highest score > total matches, or calculated number of ties < 0) are met for a tuple, the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.**
