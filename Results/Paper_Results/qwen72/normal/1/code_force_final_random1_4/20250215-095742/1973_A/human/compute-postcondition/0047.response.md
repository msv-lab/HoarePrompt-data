The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cas_de_test`. 

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3). These integers represent the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, with 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

The function returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 or a non-negative integer. 

- If any of the following conditions are met for a tuple:
  - The total points (sum of p_1, p_2, p_3) is odd.
  - The total number of matches (which is 3) is greater than 3.
  - The highest score (p_3) is greater than the total number of matches.
  - The calculated number of ties is less than 0.
  The corresponding element in `resultats` is -1.
- Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 if the total points are odd, the total matches are more than 3, the highest score is greater than the total matches, or the calculated number of ties is less than 0. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.**
