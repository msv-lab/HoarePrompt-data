To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `(p1, p2, p3)` and `cas_de_test`.

1. The loop iterates over each element in `cas_de_test`, which means `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
2. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the elements of the tuples in `cas_de_test`, and they will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` when the loop starts.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `cas_de_test` is not empty and that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are set to the values of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `p1` is the first element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is an empty list**
