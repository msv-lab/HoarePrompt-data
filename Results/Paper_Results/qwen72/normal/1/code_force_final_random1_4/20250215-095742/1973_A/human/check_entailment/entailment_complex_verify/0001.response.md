### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `cas_de_test` (a list of tuples representing the scores of the three players for each test case).

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - The check for whether the total points are even (`total_points % 2 != 0`) is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable by games and draws.

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is intended to ensure that the total number of matches is reasonable and that the highest score is achievable within the total number of matches. However, this condition is overly restrictive. The total number of matches can be more than 3, and the highest score can be equal to the total number of matches. Therefore, this condition should be revised.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula for calculating the number of draws (`egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`) is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others should be accounted for by wins and draws. This formula is correct.
   - The check `if egalites < 0` ensures that the calculated number of draws is non-negative, which is correct.
   - The final step of appending `egalites // 2` to the results is also correct.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results, which is then printed in the main part of the code.

### Re-evaluation of the Total Matches Check:
- The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is too restrictive. The total number of matches can be more than 3, and the highest score can be equal to the total number of matches. Therefore, this condition should be removed or modified to only check if `p3 > total_matchs`.

### Corrected Condition:
- The condition should be `if p3 > total_matchs` instead of `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly correct but had an overly restrictive condition in the total matches check.
- After correcting the condition, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
