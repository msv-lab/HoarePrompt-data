Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `resultats` is a list containing one element, which is -1.**
