Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `p1` is the first element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `total_points` is an odd number.**
