The code snippet `resultats.append(egalites // 2)` appends the integer division of `egalites` by 2 to the list `resultats`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
   - `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
   - `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
   - `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.
   - `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.
   - `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1` appended to its existing values. Otherwise, the state of `resultats` remains unchanged.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `egalites // 2` is calculated and appended to the list `resultats`.
   - The other variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`) remain unchanged.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `resultats` now contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values.**
