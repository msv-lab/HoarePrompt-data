### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test` as input.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks if the total points are even (`total_points % 2 != 0`). If not, it appends `-1` to the results, which is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable.

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - It checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This check is intended to ensure that the scores are achievable, but it has a logical flaw. The condition `total_matchs > 3` is too restrictive and may incorrectly rule out valid scenarios. For example, if `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, and `p3 = 6`, the total points are 6, which is even, and the total matches are 3, which is not greater than 3. However, the highest score is 6, which is greater than 3, and this should not be a reason to return `-1`.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The function uses the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` to calculate the number of draws.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others should be accounted for by wins and draws. However, the formula itself might not always correctly account for all possible scenarios, especially when the scores are close or when there are multiple draws.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results, which is then printed in the main part of the code.

### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is intended to account for the points that are not from wins (i.e., points from draws). However, it can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. For example:
  - If `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, and `p3 = 6`, the total points are 6, and the total matches are 3. The formula gives `egalites = 6 - 2 * (6 - 0) - 2 * (6 - 0) = 6 - 12 - 12 = -18`, which is clearly incorrect.
  - The correct approach would be to consider the maximum possible number of draws that can fit within the total points and the constraints of the game.

### Corrected Approach:
- Instead of using the current formula, we should consider the following:
  - The total number of matches is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
  - The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the remaining points (after accounting for the highest score) can be distributed evenly among the players.
  - We need to ensure that the total points and the distribution of points are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct in its logic for checking the total points and total matches, but the formula for calculating the number of draws is flawed. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
