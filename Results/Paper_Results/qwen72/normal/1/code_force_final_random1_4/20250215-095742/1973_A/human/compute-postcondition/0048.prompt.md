You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each element in cas_de_test is a tuple of three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` remains a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The length of `cas_de_test` is equal to `t`. `resultats` is a list containing the results of the loop for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple (p_1, p_2, p_3) in `cas_de_test`, if the total points (p_1 + p_2 + p_3) is odd, or if the total matches (total points divided by 2) is greater than 3, or if the highest score (p_3) is greater than the total matches, or if the calculated number of ties (total points - 2 * (p_3 - p_2) - 2 * (p_3 - p_1)) is less than 0, then the corresponding entry in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the corresponding entry in `resultats` is the number of ties divided by 2.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 or a non-negative integer. If the conditions (total points being odd, total matches > 3, highest score > total matches, or calculated number of ties < 0) are met for a tuple, the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 if the total points are odd, the total matches are more than 3, the highest score is greater than the total matches, or the calculated number of ties is less than 0. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 or a non-negative integer. If the conditions (total points being odd, total matches > 3, highest score > total matches, or calculated number of ties < 0) are met for a tuple, the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element is the number of ties divided by 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
