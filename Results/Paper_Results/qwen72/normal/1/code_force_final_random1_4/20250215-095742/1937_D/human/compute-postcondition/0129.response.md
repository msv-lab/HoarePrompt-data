Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`.** 

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
