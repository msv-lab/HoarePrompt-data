Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value at index `l` of the list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `a` remains the value at index `l` of the list `A`.
- The value of `x` remains `r - (l + 2)`.
- The value of `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`.
