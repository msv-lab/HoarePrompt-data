Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is greater than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`, and the difference between `l` and `r` is greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to be its original value minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the value of `(l - r - 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
