To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index 0 of `s` is not '>'.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
- `l` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the element at index `r` of `B` plus `(idx_B[r] - 0) * l`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.

2. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is defined as the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Let's denote the element at index `l - 1` of `A` as `A[l - 1]`.
   - Let's denote the value of `idx_A[l - 1]` as `idx_A[l - 1]`.
   - Therefore, `a = A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Simplifying, `a = A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l`.

3. **Value of `b`:**
   - If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0:
     - `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l`.
     - Simplifying, `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `b = B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l`.
     - Simplifying, `b = B[r] + idx_B[r] * l`.

4. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `a * 2` becomes `(A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) * 2`.
     - `b * 2` becomes either `(B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l) * 2` or `(B[r] + idx_B[r] * l) * 2` depending on the condition `r - l >= 0`.
     - `i` is 0.
     - Adding 1 to the result.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the expressions for `a` and `b`, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values for `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`. However, the structure of the output can be described as follows:

Output: **(2 * (A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l) + 1) if r - l >= 0, otherwise (2 * (A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) + 2 * (B[r] + idx_B[r] * l) + 1)**

This output describes the value that will be printed, taking into account the conditions and the formulas provided in the initial state.
