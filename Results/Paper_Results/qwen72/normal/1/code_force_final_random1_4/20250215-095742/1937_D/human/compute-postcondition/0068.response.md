The value of `b` is updated to `b - B[x]`. Since `b` was initially `B[r - 1]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, the new value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**
