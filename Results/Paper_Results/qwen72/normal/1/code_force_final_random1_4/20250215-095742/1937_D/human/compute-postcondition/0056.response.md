Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 3`, `i` was initially `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `s[i] == '<'`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0, 0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[0, 0]` and `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`. If `s[i] != '<'`, `idx_B` remains unchanged.***
