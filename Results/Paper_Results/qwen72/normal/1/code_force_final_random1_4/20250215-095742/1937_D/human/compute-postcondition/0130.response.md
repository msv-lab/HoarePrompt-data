Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. Since `i`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `b` and retains the initial values of `i`, `n`, and `a`.
