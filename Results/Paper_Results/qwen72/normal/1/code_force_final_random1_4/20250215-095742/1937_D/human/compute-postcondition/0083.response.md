The value of `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `-idx_A[l - 1] * r`.

Let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- The first character of `s` is '>'
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
- `r` is not equal to 0
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`
- If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `A[l - 1]`.

After executing the code:
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, which simplifies to `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, `b` is `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.**
