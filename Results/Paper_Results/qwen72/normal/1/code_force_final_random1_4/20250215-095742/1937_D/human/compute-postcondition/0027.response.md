Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the string `s`). The lists `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`. For each position `i` where `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` will store the index `i`, and `A` will store the calculated value `x` as defined in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty.**

To break it down further:
- `i` will be the last index of the string `s`, which is `n-1`.
- `idx_A` will contain the indices of all positions in `s` where the character is '>'.
- `A` will contain the corresponding calculated values for each position in `idx_A`. Each value in `A` is computed based on the formula provided in the loop, which depends on the previous values in `A` and `idx_A`.

If `s` contains no '>' characters, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty lists.
