To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must still hold true. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can indeed execute one more time. However, before the loop body is executed, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue)

All other variables (`l`, `r`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
