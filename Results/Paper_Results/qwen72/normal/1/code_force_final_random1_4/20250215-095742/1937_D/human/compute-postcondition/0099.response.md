The code snippet updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `b` was initially defined as `b = B[r] - B[r - l]`.
- The new value of `b` is calculated as `b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
- Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `b = b - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l)`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l)`, and the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than or equal to 0.**
