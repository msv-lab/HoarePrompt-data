Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The first character of `s` is '>'.
- `l` is less than `r`.
- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`, which simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.

2. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is `A[l]`, where `l` is an index in the list `A`.

3. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the value at index `r - 1` in the list `idx_B`.
   - `l + 1` is the value of `l` incremented by 1.

4. **Expression inside the print statement:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `a * 2` is `2 * A[l]`.
     - `b * 2` is `2 * (idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1))`.
     - `i` is 0.
     - `1` is just 1.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes:
     \[
     2 * A[l] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)) + 0 + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     2 * A[l] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1) + 1
     \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * A[l] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1) + 1`.

Output: **2 * A[l] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1) + 1**
