Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` will contain the calculated values for each position of '<' characters in the string `s`, and `idx_B` will contain the indices of these '<' characters. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty. `l` will be the number of '>' characters in `s`, and `r` will be 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, so after the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1 + 1 = n`, but since the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration, the final value of `i` will be `n-1 + 1 = n`, which is then decremented by 1 to become `-1` due to the loop's termination condition.
- The lists `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements and indices corresponding to the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`.
- The lists `B` and `idx_B` will contain elements and indices corresponding to the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`.
- The variable `l` will be incremented each time a '>' character is encountered, so it will end up being the total number of '>' characters in `s`.
- The variable `r` will be decremented each time a '<' character is encountered, so it will end up being 0 if all '<' characters have been processed.
