Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `i` was initially `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `B` is `[0, 0]`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `x` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(x)` adds the value of `x` (which is `0`) to the list `B`. Initially, `B` was `[0]`, so after appending `x`, `B` becomes `[0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
