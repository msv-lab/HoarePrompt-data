Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of the characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to calculate and print a series of integers. Each integer represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` contain intermediate values used in the calculations. The printed output is a sequence of integers that reflect the processed state of the string `s`. **
