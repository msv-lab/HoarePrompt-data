Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index 0 of `s` is not '>'.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
- `l` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `i` is 0.
2. The expression `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is 1.
3. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1 **
