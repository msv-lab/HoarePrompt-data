The code snippet `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` involves the following steps:

1. `B[r - 1]` accesses the element in the list `B` at the index `r - 1`.
2. `idx_B[r - 1]` accesses the element in the list `idx_B` at the index `r - 1`.
3. `i` is subtracted from `idx_B[r - 1]`.
4. The result of the subtraction is multiplied by `r`.
5. The product is added to `B[r - 1]`.
6. The final result is assigned to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The first character of `s` is '>'
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
- `r` is not equal to 0

Let's break down the calculation:
- `B[r - 1]` is a specific value from the list `B`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is a specific value from the list `idx_B`.
- Since `i` is 0, `idx_B[r - 1] - i` simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1]`.
- The expression `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1] * r`.
- Therefore, `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.

The output state includes:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- The first character of `s` is '>'
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
- `r` is not equal to 0
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.**
