Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r]`.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is assigned the value of `B[r]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `r` is still described as being decreased by 1, and `a` retains its initial expression.
