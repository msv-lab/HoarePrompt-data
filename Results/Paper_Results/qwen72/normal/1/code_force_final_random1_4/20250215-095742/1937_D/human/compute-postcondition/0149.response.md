To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.
- Otherwise, `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Without the exact values of `A` and `idx_A`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `a`. However, we know it is derived from the list `A` and the index `l`.

3. **Value of `b`:**
   - The value of `b` depends on the condition `r - l >= 0`.
   - If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.
   - If `r - l < 0`, then `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.
   - Again, without the exact values of `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `l`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `b`. However, we know it is derived from the list `B` and the indices `r` and `l`.

4. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the known value of `i`:
     - `a * 2 + b * 2 + 1 + 1` simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific lists `A`, `B`, and the indices `l` and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 2 (where `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is determined based on the condition `r - l >= 0` as described above)**
