Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `A[l - 1]`.***
