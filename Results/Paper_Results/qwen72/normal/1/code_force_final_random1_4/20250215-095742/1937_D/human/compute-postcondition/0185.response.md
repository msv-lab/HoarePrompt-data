Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- Since `i` is 2, the new value of `a` becomes `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.
