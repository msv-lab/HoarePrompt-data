### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining how long it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicators ('<' or '>') at each cell. The solution involves precomputing two arrays, `A` and `B`, which store the cumulative effects of the pinball's movements when it encounters '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `s`.

2. **Precomputation of Arrays `A` and `B`:**
   - **Array `A`:** This array is computed for positions where the character is '>'. It stores the cumulative effect of the pinball moving to the right and the number of '>' characters encountered.
   - **Array `B`:** This array is computed for positions where the character is '<'. It stores the cumulative effect of the pinball moving to the left and the number of '<' characters encountered.

3. **Processing Each Query:**
   - The program iterates through each cell of the grid and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the precomputed arrays `A` and `B`.
   - The logic for calculating the time involves considering the current position, the cumulative effects stored in `A` and `B`, and the direction of movement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string `s` by appropriately setting the initial values of `A` and `B`.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly initializes and processes the input.
- The precomputation of `A` and `B` is done efficiently and accurately.
- The main loop for processing each query correctly uses the precomputed values to calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
- The program handles edge cases and ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem description.
