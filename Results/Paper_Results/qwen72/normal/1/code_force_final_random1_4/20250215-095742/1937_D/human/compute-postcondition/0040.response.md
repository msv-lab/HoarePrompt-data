Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now a list containing the value `i`. If `idx_B` was empty before, `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is no longer an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is not empty. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.***
