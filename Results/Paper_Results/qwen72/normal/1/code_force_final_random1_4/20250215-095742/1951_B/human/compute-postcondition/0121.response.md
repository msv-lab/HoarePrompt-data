Postcondition: ***`s` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the third element in `s`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, and the conditions regarding `h`, `z`, and the previous value of `ans1` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. Otherwise, the conditions regarding `h`, `z`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.***
