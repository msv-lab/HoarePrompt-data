You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
```
def func_1(a):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and remains unchanged. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100,000.

Case_2: The program returns 13.

Case_3: The program returns the value of the first element in the list `ind` minus 1, where `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. Here, `k` is 14, `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `x` is `a[14]`. Since `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, the program calculates `14 - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, and returns the larger of these two values.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1. Here, `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of the element `x` in `a`. The first element of `ind` is 0, and `ind` has a length greater than 1.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), where `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is the index of the first such element, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second such element.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is the index from which `x` was taken (specifically 14 if `k` is 14).

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
