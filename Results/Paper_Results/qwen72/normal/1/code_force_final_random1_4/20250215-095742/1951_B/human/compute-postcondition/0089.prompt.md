Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the new input, the first element of `s` (s[0]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) is now the original `s[0]`, `h` is the original `s[k-1]`, `j` is -1, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and either `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or the element is greater than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `z` is 1 if any element in `s` is equal to `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if any element is greater than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `h` is now the first element of `s` (s[0]).
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the first element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[1]`), and `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `h` is greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the second element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[2]`), and `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `h` is greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` has at least 4 elements, `i` is the third element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[3]`), and `j` is increased by 1. If `h` < `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
