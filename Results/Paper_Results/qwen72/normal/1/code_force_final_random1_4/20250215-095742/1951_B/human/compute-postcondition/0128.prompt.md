Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `j` is the index of `i` in `s` (starting from 0), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to `i` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `ans1` is 0, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[p]` before the swap, and `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `z` is set to 1 and `ans1` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the second element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `z` is set to 1 and `ans1` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the third element in `s`. The conditions regarding `h`, `z`, and `ans1` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` == `h`, `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, and `z` is now 1. If `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` â‰¤ `h` and `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
