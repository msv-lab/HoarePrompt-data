Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and all a_i's are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) is now the original `s[p]`, the `p`th element of `s` (s[p]) is now the original `s[k-1]`, `h` is the original `s[k-1]`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and either `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or the element is greater than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `z` is 1 if any element in `s` is equal to `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if any element is greater than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before breaking out of the loop, `j` is the index of `i` in `s` (starting from 0), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to `i` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `ans1` is the total count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and occur after the first occurrence of `h` or after any element greater than `h`, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[p]` before the swap, and `z` is 1 if `h` was found in `s` and 0 otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `ans1` will reflect the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and for which `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, plus any additional increments due to the condition where `z` is 1 and the current element `i` is less than or equal to `h`. The variable `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` was equal to `h`. The value of `i` will be the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`). All other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `h`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
