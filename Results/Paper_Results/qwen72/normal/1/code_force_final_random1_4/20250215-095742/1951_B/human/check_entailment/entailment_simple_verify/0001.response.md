### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a sequence of matches where each match is between the current cow and the winner of the previous match.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of wins for a specific cow `k` by optionally swapping its position with another cow.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list of ratings.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It extracts the rating of cow `k` and initializes an empty list `ind` to store indices of cows with higher ratings.
   - It iterates through the list of ratings to find the first two indices of cows with higher ratings than cow `k`.
   - Depending on the positions of these indices, it calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic:**
   - **No Higher Ratings:**
     - If there are no cows with higher ratings, cow `k` can win all remaining matches (`n-1`).
   - **One Higher Rating:**
     - If there is only one cow with a higher rating:
       - If this cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `k-1` matches.
       - If this cow is after cow `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0]-1` matches.
       - Otherwise, cow `k` can win the maximum of `k - ind[0]` or `ind[0] - 1` matches.
   - **Two Higher Ratings:**
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
     - If cow `k` is after the second higher-rated cow, cow `k` can win up to `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])` matches.
     - Otherwise, cow `k` can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `k - ind[0]` matches.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the different scenarios and edge cases.
   - The function returns the correct number of wins for each test case based on the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
