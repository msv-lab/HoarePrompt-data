Output State: **`s` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `s[1]`, `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[p]` before the swap, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `ans` is 1, `h` is the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `j` is 0, and all other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `ans1`, `p`, `z`) remain unchanged. Additionally, `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.**
