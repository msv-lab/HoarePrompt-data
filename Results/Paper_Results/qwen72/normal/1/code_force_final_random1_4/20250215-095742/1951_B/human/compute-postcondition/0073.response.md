The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The initial state specifies that `s` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the first element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[1]`). These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the first element in `s[1:]` (i.e., `s[1]`), `j` is increased by 1.**
