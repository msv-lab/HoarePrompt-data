The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 1 if `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 2. Therefore, after the increment, `c` will be 2 if `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` will be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is a list containing `[1, 1, 2]`, `c` is 2 if `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 3, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
