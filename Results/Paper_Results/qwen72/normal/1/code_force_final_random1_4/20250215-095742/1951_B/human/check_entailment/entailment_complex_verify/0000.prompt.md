You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of unique integers as input and returns an integer based on the following conditions: If no elements in `a` are greater than the element at index `k` (where `k` is a predefined index, typically 14), the function returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. If only one element in `a` is greater than the element at index `k`, the function returns either `k - 1` if the index of this element is 0, or the index of this element minus 1 if it is greater than `k`, or the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` otherwise. If two elements in `a` are greater than the element at index `k`, the function returns the minimum of the second element's index minus 1 and `k - 1` if the first element's index is 0, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `k` is greater than the second element's index, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the optimal swap position for the cow `k` to maximize its wins. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Indices**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the indices where the cow `k` could potentially win more matches. It only considers the first two indices where the cow `k` would lose, but it does not consider the optimal swap position to maximize wins.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the cow `k` is already in a position where it can win the maximum number of matches without any swaps.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is flawed. It does not correctly account for the scenario where the cow `k` can be swapped to a position where it can win more matches.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
```
Here, the cow `k` (index 3) has a rating of 30. The optimal strategy would be to swap the cow `k` to position 2 (index 1) to maximize its wins. However, the provided program does not correctly handle this case and may return an incorrect result.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Identify the positions where the cow `k` can win the most matches.
2. Consider swapping the cow `k` to these positions and calculate the maximum number of wins.
3. Return the maximum number of wins after considering all possible swaps.

By addressing these issues, the program can be made to handle all potential cases correctly.
