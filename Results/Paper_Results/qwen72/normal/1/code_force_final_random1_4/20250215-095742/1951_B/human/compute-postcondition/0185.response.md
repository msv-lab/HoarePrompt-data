The value of `ans1` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), and the list `s` must still contain at least one element. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), the list `s` must still contain at least one element, `ans1` is increased by 1.**
