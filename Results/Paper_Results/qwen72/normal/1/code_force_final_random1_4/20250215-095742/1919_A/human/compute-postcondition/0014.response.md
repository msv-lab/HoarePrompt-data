Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations that were specified initially. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated with new integer values from user input, and `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration. The values of `a` and `b` are the last set of integers provided by the user input, and `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` using these last values.**
