Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This approach is overly simplistic and does not consider the strategic aspects of the game, such as the optimal moves each player can make.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:
- Consider the case where Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1 coin (`a = 2`, `b = 1`).

According to the program:
- `func_1(2, 1)` returns 'Alice' because `(2 + 1) % 2 == 1`.

However, let's analyze the game:
1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
3. Bob now has 2 coins and can choose to swap back. After swapping, Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1 coin.
4. Alice can remove 1 coin from her wallet, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 1 coin.
5. Bob can remove 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 1 coin.
6. Alice can now remove the last coin from her wallet, leaving both wallets empty.
7. Bob cannot make a move and thus loses.

In this scenario, Bob should win, but the program incorrectly predicts that Alice wins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
