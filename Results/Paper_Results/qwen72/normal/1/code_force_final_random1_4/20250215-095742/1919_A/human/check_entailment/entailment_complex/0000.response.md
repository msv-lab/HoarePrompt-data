Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have in their wallets. The key insight is that the game is essentially about parity (even or odd). If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves. If the sum is odd, Alice will win because she starts first and can force Bob into a losing position.

- `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'. This logic aligns with the game's rules and the problem statement.
- `func_2()` handles multiple test cases as required. It reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)` with the appropriate inputs, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program correctly implements the solution and meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
