The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterates over a fixed range defined by `t`, after each iteration, `t` effectively decreases by 1 (though `t` itself is not modified in the loop head, the loop counter implicitly decrements `t`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
