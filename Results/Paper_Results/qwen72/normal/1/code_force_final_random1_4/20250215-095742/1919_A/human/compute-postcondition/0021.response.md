Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is the total number of iterations specified initially. Each element in `results` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. `a` and `b` hold the last set of integers provided by the user input, and `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` using these last values.**

### Explanation:
- **`results`**: This list contains the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, it will have exactly `t` elements, where `t` is the total number of iterations.
- **`a` and `b`**: These variables hold the last set of integers provided by the user input during the final iteration.
- **`winner`**: This variable holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` using the last set of integers provided by the user input, which corresponds to the last iteration of the loop.
