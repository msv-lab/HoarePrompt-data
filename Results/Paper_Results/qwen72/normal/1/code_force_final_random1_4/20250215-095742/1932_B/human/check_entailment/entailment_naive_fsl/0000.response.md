Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding `year % ai or ai` to `year`.
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is `year + ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which simplifies to `year + (ai - (year % ai))` or simply `year + ai` if `year % ai` is 0.
4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `year` for each test case.

The logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign has occurred. The program handles all edge cases, such as when all periodicities are 1, and it correctly computes the year for the nth sign to occur.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
