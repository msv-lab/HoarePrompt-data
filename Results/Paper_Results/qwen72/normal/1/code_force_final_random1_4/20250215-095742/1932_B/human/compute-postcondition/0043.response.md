Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must have at least three elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to be equal to the value of `next_year`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `ai`) remain unchanged.
- The specific conditions and constraints on these variables (e.g., `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `test_cases` having at least 2 elements, etc.) remain valid and unchanged.
