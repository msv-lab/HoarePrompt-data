Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a`, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, a = test` assigns the first element of the tuple `test` to `n` and the second element of the tuple `test` to `a`.
- `n` is now the first element of `test`.
- `a` is now the second element of `test`, which is a list with `n` elements.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `current_year`, and `ai` remain unchanged.
- `test` is updated to be the next element in `test_cases`.
