Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are input integers. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory.**
