To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while lst[tmp] != []:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `lst[tmp]`.
   - `lst` is a list, and `tmp` is an index into this list.

2. **Current State:**
   - `x` is 1.
   - `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs.
   - `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs.
   - `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged.
   - `z` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` is equal to `z`.
   - `one` is True.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list (`[]`).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.
   - Since `tmp` is equal to `z`, we need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current state does not specify the contents of `lst[z]`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `lst[z]` is not an empty list.

### Adjusted State:
- We need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not an empty list. This can be achieved by specifying that `lst[z]` contains at least one element.

State: **`x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, and `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is True.**
