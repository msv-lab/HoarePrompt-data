Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of `start`. The `visited` set contains the integer `start` and all its unvisited neighbors. `current` remains equal to `start`, `dist` remains 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed. `visited` set contains the integer `start` and all its unvisited neighbors, as well as all other nodes that have been processed. `current` is now equal to the first element of the last tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the last tuple that was removed from the `queue`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`), which represents the number of steps taken from the `start` node to reach the `target` node. If the `queue` is empty and `current` does not equal `target`, the loop terminates without finding the `target` node.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The `start` and `target` remain integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but it may now be empty if all nodes have been processed. The `visited` set contains the integer `start`, all its unvisited neighbors, and all other nodes that have been processed. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) which represents the shortest path length from the starting node (`start`) to the current node being processed in the tree. Otherwise, `current` is the last node processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
