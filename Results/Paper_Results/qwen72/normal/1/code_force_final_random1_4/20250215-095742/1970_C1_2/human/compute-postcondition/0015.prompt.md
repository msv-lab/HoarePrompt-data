Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is an integer `u_1` where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are input integers. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(x - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    lst[a].append(b)
    rev[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `x` is greater than 1, `lst[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element, `rev[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element, and the other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`, `rev`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `x` is greater than 1, `lst[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element (appended), `rev[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element (appended twice), and the other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`, `rev`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `x` is greater than 0, `lst[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element (appended twice), `rev[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element (appended three times), and the other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`, `rev`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
