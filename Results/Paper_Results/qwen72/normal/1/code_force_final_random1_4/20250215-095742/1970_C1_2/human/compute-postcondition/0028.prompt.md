Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, and `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs. The other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`) remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`. `one` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, `lst[z]` is now one element shorter, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element that was removed from `lst[z]`, `one` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, `lst[z]` is now one element shorter, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the second-to-last element that was removed from `lst[z]`, `one` is True, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list, and `lst[tmp]` is now one element shorter.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, `lst[z]` is now one element shorter, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element that was removed from `lst[z]`, `one` is False, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list and contains at least one element less than before.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
