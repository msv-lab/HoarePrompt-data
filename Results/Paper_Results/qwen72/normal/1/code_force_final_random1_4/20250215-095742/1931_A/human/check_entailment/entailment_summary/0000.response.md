Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The logic in the program is designed to handle different ranges of `n` to construct the word accordingly. Let's break down the logic:

1. **If `n` > 52**: 
   - The largest possible sum for a two-letter word is 52 (i.e., 'zz' = 26 + 26).
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be the character at index `n - 53` (since `n - 52` gives the remaining value, and we need to adjust by 1 to get the correct index in the alphabet), followed by 'zz'.
   - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.

2. **If 26 < `n` ≤ 52**:
   - The largest possible sum for a one-letter word is 26 (i.e., 'z').
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52, the word starts with 'a' (smallest possible first letter), followed by the character at index `n - 28` (since `n - 27` gives the remaining value, and we need to adjust by 1 to get the correct index in the alphabet), and ends with 'z'.
   - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because 'a' is the smallest possible first letter, and the second letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.

3. **If `n` ≤ 26**:
   - If `n` is 26 or less, the word is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` (since `n - 2` gives the remaining value, and we need to adjust by 1 to get the correct index in the alphabet).
   - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because 'aa' is the smallest possible start, and the third letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
