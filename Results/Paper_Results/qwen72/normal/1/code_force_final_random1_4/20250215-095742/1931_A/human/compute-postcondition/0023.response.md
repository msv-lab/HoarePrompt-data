The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input integer `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, and `word` remains the same based on the initial conditions of `n`**
