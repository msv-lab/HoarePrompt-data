Output State: **`i` is equal to the number of test cases provided minus 1, each `n` has been an input integer corresponding to each test case, and for each `n`, `word` was determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list and then `'z'`. If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list. Each `word` was printed for each test case.**
