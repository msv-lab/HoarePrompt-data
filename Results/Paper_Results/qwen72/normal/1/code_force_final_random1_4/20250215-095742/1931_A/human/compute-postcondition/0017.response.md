The value of `word` is updated by appending the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by the string `'zz'`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, it now contains the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list plus the string `'zz'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`.**
