### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose sum of the positions of its characters equals a given integer `n`.
   - The positions of the characters are based on their order in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**
     - If \( n \) is greater than 52, the code constructs the word by adding the character at position \( n - 53 \) followed by "zz".
     - This works because the maximum sum of two 'z's (26 + 26) is 52. Therefore, any \( n \) greater than 52 must include at least one 'z' in the last two positions.
     - The remaining value \( n - 52 \) is used to determine the first character.
     - Example: For \( n = 70 \), the word is "rzz" because \( 70 - 53 = 17 \) and the 17th letter is 'r'.

   - **Case 2: \( 26 < n \leq 52 \)**
     - If \( n \) is between 27 and 52, the code constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the character at position \( n - 28 \) and 'z'.
     - This works because the maximum sum of 'a' and 'z' (1 + 26) is 27. Therefore, any \( n \) in this range must include 'a' and 'z' with the middle character determined by \( n - 27 \).
     - Example: For \( n = 55 \), the word is "czz" because \( 55 - 28 = 27 \) and the 27th letter is 'c'.

   - **Case 3: \( 3 \leq n \leq 26 \)**
     - If \( n \) is between 3 and 26, the code constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the character at position \( n - 3 \).
     - This works because the minimum sum of three 'a's is 3. Therefore, any \( n \) in this range can be represented by 'aa' followed by the appropriate character.
     - Example: For \( n = 3 \), the word is "aaa" because \( 3 - 3 = 0 \) and the 0th letter is 'a'.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles all possible values of \( n \) within the given constraints.
   - The constructed words are indeed the lexicographically smallest for each \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Final: **True**
