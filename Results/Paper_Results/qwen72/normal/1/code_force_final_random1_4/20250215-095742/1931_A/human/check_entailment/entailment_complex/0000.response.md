Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each case.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**: The program initializes the `alphabet` variable with all lowercase letters, which is necessary for mapping indices to letters.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - **Case 1 (n > 52)**: The program constructs the word by adding the character at index `n - 53` followed by `'zz'`. This is correct because the maximum possible value for the sum of three letters is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and the smallest possible value for the first letter in this case is 27 (which corresponds to `'a'` + 26 + 26). Therefore, `n - 53` gives the correct index for the first letter, and `'zz'` ensures the lexicographically smallest combination.
   - **Case 2 (26 < n ≤ 52)**: The program constructs the word by adding `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` and then `'z'`. This is correct because the smallest possible value for the first letter in this case is 27 (which corresponds to `'a'` + 26 + 1), and the second letter is determined by `n - 28`, ensuring the lexicographically smallest combination.
   - **Case 3 (n ≤ 26)**: The program constructs the word by adding `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This is correct because the smallest possible value for the first two letters is 2 (which corresponds to `'a'` + `'a'` + 1), and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the constructed word for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each input `n`.

Correctness: **True**
