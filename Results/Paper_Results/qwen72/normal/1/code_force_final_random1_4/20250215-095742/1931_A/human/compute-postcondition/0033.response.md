The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each including an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78. This integer represents the encoded value of a three-letter word. The function's task is to determine and return the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to the given `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and returns the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to the given `n`.**
