Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. The function should return or print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to the given `n`. `alphabet` is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the string consisting of the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is `'a'` + the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list + `'z'`. If `n` is between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list and then `'z'`. If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, and `word` is either `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` if `n` > 52, or `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` if 26 < `n` ≤ 52, or `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` if 2 < `n` ≤ 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
