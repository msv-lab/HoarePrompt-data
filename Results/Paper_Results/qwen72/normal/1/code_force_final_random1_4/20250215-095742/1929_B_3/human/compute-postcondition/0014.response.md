The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation overwrites the previous values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` and `k` are new input integers. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true. Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.**
