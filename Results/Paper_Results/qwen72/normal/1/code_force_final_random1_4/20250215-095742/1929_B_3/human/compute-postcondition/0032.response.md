Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input, where each line (except the first) contains two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each line as a separate test case. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `k` and `4 * n - 4`, `4 * n - 3`, and `4 * n - 2`. Specifically, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)` if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, `2 * n - 1` if `k` is `4 * n - 3`, and `2 * n` if `k` is `4 * n - 2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The initial parameter `t` (the number of test cases) is not explicitly passed to the function but is inferred from the input. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output through print statements. **
