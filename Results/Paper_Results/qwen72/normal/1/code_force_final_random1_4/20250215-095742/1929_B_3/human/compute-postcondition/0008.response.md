The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the state, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (since the loop has run once), but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true. Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.**
