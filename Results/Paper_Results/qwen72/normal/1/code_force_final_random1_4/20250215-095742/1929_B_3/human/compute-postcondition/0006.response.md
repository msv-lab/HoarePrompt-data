To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `(4 * n - 2) != k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is an integer input. The only constraint given about `k` is that it cannot be equal to `4 * n - 2`. This means `k` can be any integer except `4 * n - 2`.

2. **Expression `k / 2`**: This expression divides `k` by 2. Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` could result in a floating-point number if `k` is odd.

3. **Function `ceil(k / 2)`**: The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds up the result of `k / 2` to the nearest integer. If `k` is even, `k / 2` is already an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be `k / 2`. If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a floating-point number, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of `k / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2, and k is an integer input such that k != 4 * n - 2)**
