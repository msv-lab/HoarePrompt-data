Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `dp = True` sets the variable `dp` to `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `tc` being greater than 0 after decrementing by 1 remains valid.
- The list `arr` is still a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
- The variable `i` is still `n-1`.
- The variable `dp` is now explicitly set to `True`, regardless of its previous value.
