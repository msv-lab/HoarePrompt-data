Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to be correctly addressing the problem statement. It processes each test case by:

1. Reading the number of piles.
2. Reading the sizes of the piles and removing duplicates (since multiple piles of the same size behave identically in this game).
3. Sorting the unique pile sizes in descending order and appending a zero to handle edge cases.
4. Using a dynamic programming (DP) approach to determine the winner based on the differences between consecutive pile sizes. The logic `dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` effectively checks if the current player can force a win by making a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.
5. Printing "Alice" if the final state of `dp` is `True`, indicating Alice has a winning strategy; otherwise, printing "Bob".

This approach leverages the fact that the game is a form of Nim, where the key to determining the winner lies in the parity and differences of the pile sizes. The solution correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring optimal play for both players.
