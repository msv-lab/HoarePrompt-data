The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. tc is an input integer and must be greater than 0. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
