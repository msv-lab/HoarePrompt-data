The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a set of piles with stones. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles.
  - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`: Integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The exact nature of the processing and the specific output for each test case is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function will return some form of result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of piles, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
