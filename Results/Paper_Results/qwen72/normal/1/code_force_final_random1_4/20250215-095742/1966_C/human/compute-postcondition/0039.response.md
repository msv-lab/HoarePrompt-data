Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `tc` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is now `n-1`, `dp` is now `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
- Since `i` is now `n-1`, the new value of `dp` is determined by `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
