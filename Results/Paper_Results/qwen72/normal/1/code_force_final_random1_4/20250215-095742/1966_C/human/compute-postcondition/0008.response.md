To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 1.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
- `dp` is True.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The loop condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 2, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `dp` is True, `i` is 2.**
