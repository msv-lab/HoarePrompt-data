To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or `dp` was `False` before, otherwise `dp` is `False`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the upper bound `n`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, it needs to be set to `n-1` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

### Final State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `tc` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `n-1`.
- `dp` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or `dp` was `False` before, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
