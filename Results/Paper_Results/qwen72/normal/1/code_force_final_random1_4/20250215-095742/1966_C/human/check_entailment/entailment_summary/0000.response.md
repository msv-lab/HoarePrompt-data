Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where the game involves removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity of the differences between the sizes of the piles. Specifically, the game can be reduced to a Nim-like game where the critical factor is whether the smallest difference between consecutive unique pile sizes is even or odd.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and why it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into a list `arr`.

2. **Processing Piles**: The list `arr` is converted to a set to remove duplicates, then sorted in descending order. This step ensures that we only consider unique pile sizes and process them from largest to smallest.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization**: A boolean variable `dp` is initialized to `True`. This variable will help determine the winner based on the parity of the differences between consecutive pile sizes.

4. **Iterating Through Piles**: The program iterates through the sorted list of unique pile sizes. For each pair of consecutive sizes, it checks if the difference is greater than 1 or if the current value of `dp` is `False`. If either condition is true, `dp` is toggled to `True`; otherwise, it remains `False`.

5. **Determining the Winner**: After processing all unique pile sizes, the program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` (indicating Alice wins), otherwise it prints "Bob".

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Unique Pile Sizes**: By considering only unique pile sizes, the program simplifies the problem to a more manageable form. This is crucial because the game's outcome depends on the differences between these unique sizes.
- **Parity Check**: The key insight is that the game can be won by the player who can force the opponent into a position where the smallest difference between consecutive pile sizes is even. If the smallest difference is odd, the player whose turn it is can always make a move that leaves an even difference, thus ensuring they can always respond to the opponent's moves until the end of the game.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1**: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Unique pile sizes: `[3]`
  - No differences to check, `dp` remains `True`.
  - Output: "Alice"

- **Test Case 2**: `[1, 7]`
  - Unique pile sizes: `[7, 1]`
  - Differences: `7 - 1 = 6` (even)
  - `dp` is toggled to `False`.
  - Output: "Bob"

- **Test Case 3**: `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`
  - Unique pile sizes: `[100, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
  - Differences: `100 - 9 = 91` (odd), `9 - 7 = 2` (even), `7 - 4 = 3` (odd), `4 - 3 = 1` (odd), `3 - 2 = 1` (odd), `2 - 1 = 1` (odd)
  - `dp` remains `True`.
  - Output: "Alice"

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and the properties of the pile sizes. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
