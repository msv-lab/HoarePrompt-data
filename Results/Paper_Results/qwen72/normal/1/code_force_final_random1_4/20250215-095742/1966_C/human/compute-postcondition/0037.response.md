Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or `dp` was `False` before, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the previous value of `dp`.
- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is true, `dp` becomes `True`.
- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is false and `dp` was `True` before, `dp` remains `True`.
- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is false and `dp` was `False` before, `dp` remains `False`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
