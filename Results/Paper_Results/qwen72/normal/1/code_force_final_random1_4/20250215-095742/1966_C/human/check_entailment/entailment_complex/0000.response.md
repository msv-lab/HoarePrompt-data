Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the game theory problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from piles, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key to solving this problem lies in determining whether the game state is a winning or losing position for the first player (Alice). The logic used in the program is based on the observation that the game can be reduced to a simpler form by considering the unique sizes of the piles and their differences.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and, for each test case, the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`arr`).

2. **Unique Pile Sizes**: The program converts the pile sizes to a set to get unique values and sorts them in descending order. This step is crucial because it simplifies the problem by focusing on the distinct pile sizes and their differences.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization**: The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`. This variable is used to track whether the current state is a winning state for the player whose turn it is.

4. **Loop Through Unique Pile Sizes**: The program iterates through the unique pile sizes and updates the `dp` variable based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes. Specifically, if the difference between two consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, or if the current state is already a winning state (`dp` is `True`), then the current state remains a winning state.

5. **Output the Winner**: After processing the unique pile sizes, the program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True`, indicating that Alice has a winning strategy; otherwise, it prints "Bob".

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program handles the constraints specified in the problem statement, such as the number of test cases and the range of pile sizes.

The logic used in the program is sound and aligns with the game theory principles for this type of problem. The use of unique pile sizes and their differences effectively captures the essence of the game, ensuring that the program can determine the winner correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
