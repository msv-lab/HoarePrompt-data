To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1. This is the initial value required for the loop to begin its first iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these conditions, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is set to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `dp` is True, `i` is 1**
