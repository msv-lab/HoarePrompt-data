The function processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The matrix contains characters 'F', 'S', '?', and '.', representing funny, scary, undecided, and no transition states, respectively. The function reads the matrix from user input and updates the undecided states ('?') based on the distribution of 'F' and 'S' characters. It ensures that the resulting matrix maintains the symmetry and the constraints on the number of 'F' and 'S' characters. The function prints the updated matrix, where each undecided state is replaced with 'F' or 'S' according to specific rules: if there are more indices with 'F' than 'S', undecided states are more likely to become 'F', especially in the first quarter of the matrix; otherwise, they are more likely to become 'S'.
