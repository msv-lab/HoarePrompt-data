Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index 3 is incremented by 1 and the element at index 5 is incremented by 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` unchanged, `xx` contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again, `j` is 5, `x` is a new user input string. If `x[3]` is 'F', then the elements at index 3 and 4 of `a` are each incremented by 1. If `x[3]` is 'S', then the elements at index 3 and 4 of `b` are each incremented by 1.**
