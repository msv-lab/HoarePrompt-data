The code snippet provided attempts to concatenate the string `'F'` to the variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which would typically result in a `NameError` in Python. Since the task requires simulating the execution, we'll assume `nx` starts as an empty string (`''`) if it's not defined.

Given this assumption:
- `nx` is now the string `'F'`.
- The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'F'**
