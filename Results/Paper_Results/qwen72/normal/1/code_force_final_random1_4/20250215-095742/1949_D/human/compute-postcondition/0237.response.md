Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is still 1, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters at each index across all input strings, respectively. `xx` is a list containing `n` user input strings. `sa` and `sb` are lists containing indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, respectively, with the length of `sa` being less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` contains the value `j`. The variable `nx` is a string that has been built by iterating through the string `xx[1]` and appending each character to `nx` unless it is a '?'. If a '?' is encountered, 'S' is appended if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`; otherwise, 'F' is appended. After all iterations, `nx` will contain the final constructed string based on these rules.**
