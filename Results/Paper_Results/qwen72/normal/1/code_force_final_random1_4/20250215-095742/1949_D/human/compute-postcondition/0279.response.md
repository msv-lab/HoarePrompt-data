The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value at the position `[i][j - 1]` in the list `xx`. Given the initial state:

- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 2
- `i` is `n + 1`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `i` is `n + 1`, so `i` is an integer between 3 and 25.
2. `j - 1` is `2 - 1`, which equals 1.
3. `xx[i][j - 1]` is `xx[i][1]`, which means we are accessing the element in the list `xx` at the row `i` and column 1.
4. `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][1]` to its current value.

Since the initial value of `nx` is not specified, we will assume it has some initial value (let's call it `initial_nx`). After executing the code, `nx` will be `initial_nx + xx[i][1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is `initial_nx + xx[n + 1][1]`**.
