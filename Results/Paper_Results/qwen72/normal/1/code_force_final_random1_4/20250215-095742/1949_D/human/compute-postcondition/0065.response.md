Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters in `x`, `xx` now contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again, `j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a new user input string, and the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**
