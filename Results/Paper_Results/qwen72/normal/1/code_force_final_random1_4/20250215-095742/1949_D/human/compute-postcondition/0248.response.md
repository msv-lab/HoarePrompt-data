The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we assume `nx` is a string. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `i`, `xx`, `sb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, and `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.**
