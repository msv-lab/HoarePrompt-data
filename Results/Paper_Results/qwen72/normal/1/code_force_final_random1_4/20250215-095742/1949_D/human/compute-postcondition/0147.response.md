To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `xx` is a list containing `n` strings.
   - `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0.
   - `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`.
   - The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - `nx` is constructed from `xx[1]` by replacing question marks (`?`) with either 'F' or 'S' based on the following conditions:
     - If the current index `j` or the index `i` is in the first quarter of `sa`, replace the question mark with 'F'.
     - Otherwise, replace the question mark with 'S'.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `i` is 1, so we need to check if `i` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa`.
   - The first quarter of `sa` is the first `len(sa) // 4` elements of `sa`.
   - For each position in `xx[1]`:
     - If the character is not a question mark (`?`), it remains unchanged in `nx`.
     - If the character is a question mark (`?`), we check if the current index `j` or the index `i` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa`.
       - If true, replace the question mark with 'F'.
       - If false, replace the question mark with 'S'.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The string `nx` will contain the characters from `xx[1]` where the corresponding character is not a question mark (`?`).
   - For positions in `xx[1]` that are question marks (`?`):
     - If the current index `j` or the index `i` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa`, the question mark will be replaced with 'F'.
     - Otherwise, the question mark will be replaced with 'S'.

Given the initial state and the construction rules, the output will be a string `nx` where:
- Non-question mark characters from `xx[1]` remain unchanged.
- Question marks in `xx[1]` are replaced with 'F' if the current index `j` or the index `i` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa`.
- Otherwise, question marks are replaced with 'S'.

Output: **nx (where nx is constructed from xx[1] by replacing question marks with 'F' if the current index j or the index i is in the first quarter of sa, otherwise with 'S')**
