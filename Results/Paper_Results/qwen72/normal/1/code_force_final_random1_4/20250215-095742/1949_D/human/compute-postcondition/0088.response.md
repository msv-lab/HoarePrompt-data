Output State: **`xx` now contains three strings: the original user input string `x`, the same user input string `x` appended again, and the new user input string `x`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `xx.append(x)` adds the new user input string `x` to the list `xx`.
- Initially, `xx` contained two strings: the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again.
- After executing the code, `xx` now contains these two strings plus the new user input string `x`, making a total of three strings.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `j` are not affected by this operation and remain the same as in the initial state.
