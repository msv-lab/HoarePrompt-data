Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings. `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string.**
