### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions involving each scenario.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` and updates `a` and `b` accordingly.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

2. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - This step is also correct and helps in identifying the scenarios that have already been assigned a type.

3. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program checks if the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to those with only scary transitions (`sb`).
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it assigns the remaining transitions to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.
   - If `len(sb) > len(sa)`, it does the opposite.
   - The logic here is intended to balance the distribution of funny and scary transitions to avoid having too many of the same type in a row. However, the specific rule of assigning transitions based on the first quarter of the matrix (`n // 4`) might not always ensure the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program constructs the final transition matrix by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on the conditions set in the previous steps.
   - It prints the final transition matrix.
   - The output generation is correct in terms of format and symmetry, but the logic for ensuring the constraint on consecutive transitions might be flawed.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Parsing and Initialization:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
  - It correctly updates the counts of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.

- **Correctness of Handling Undecided Transitions:**
  - The logic for handling undecided transitions is intended to balance the distribution of funny and scary transitions, but it might not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.
  - Specifically, the condition `i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]` and `i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]` might not be sufficient to guarantee the constraint for all permutations of scenarios.

- **Output Generation:**
  - The program correctly generates the output matrix and prints it in the required format.
  - It respects the constraints of the problem, including the symmetry of the transition matrix, but the logic for ensuring the constraint on consecutive transitions might be insufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling undecided transitions and ensuring the constraint on consecutive transitions might not always be correct. The specific rule of assigning transitions based on the first quarter of the matrix (`n // 4`) might not be robust enough to handle all possible permutations of scenarios.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
