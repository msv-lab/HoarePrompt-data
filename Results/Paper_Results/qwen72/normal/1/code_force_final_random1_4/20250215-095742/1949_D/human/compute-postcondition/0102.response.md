Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing the integer 2 if `a[2] > 0` and `b[2] == 0`, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the integer 2.**
