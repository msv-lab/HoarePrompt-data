Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` now contains the value `j`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing this character. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` is '?', `nx` is 'S' if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'. `j` is 2, and `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]` followed by either 'S' if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.**
