Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 1. If the character at index 2 in the string `xx[3]` is not '?', then `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]`. Otherwise, if either `i` (which is 3) or `j` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0` and any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 2. If the character at index 2 in the string `xx[3]` is not '?', then `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]` followed by the character at index 1 in the string `xx[3]`. Otherwise, if either `i` (which is 3) or `j` (which is 2) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0` and any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 3. If the character at index 2 in the string `xx[3]` is not '?', then `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]` followed by the character at index 1 in the string `xx[3]`. Otherwise, if either `i` (which is 3) or `j` (which is 3) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
