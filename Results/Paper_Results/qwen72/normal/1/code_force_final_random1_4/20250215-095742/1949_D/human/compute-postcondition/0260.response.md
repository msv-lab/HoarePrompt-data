Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to the existing value of `nx`. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nx` and retains the initial conditions for `n` and `j`.
