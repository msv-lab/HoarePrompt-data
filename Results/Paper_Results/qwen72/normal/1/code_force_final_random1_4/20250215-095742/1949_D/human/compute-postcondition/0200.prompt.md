Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`. The string `nx` contains the characters from `xx[1]` where the corresponding character is not a question mark (`?`). For positions in `xx[1]` that are question marks (`?`), `nx` contains 'F' if the current index `j` or the index `i` is in the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise it contains 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string constructed by iterating through each character in `xx[2]` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character, if it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If it is '?', and either `i` (which is 2) or the current index `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is a string constructed by iterating through each character in `xx[3]` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character, if it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If it is '?', and if the current index `j` (or `i` which is 3) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
