The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value at the position `[i][j - 1]` in the list `xx`. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `j` is 2.
- The value of `j - 1` is 1.
- The value of `xx[i][1]` is added to `nx`.

Since the specific values of `i`, `xx`, and the initial value of `nx` are not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`.**
