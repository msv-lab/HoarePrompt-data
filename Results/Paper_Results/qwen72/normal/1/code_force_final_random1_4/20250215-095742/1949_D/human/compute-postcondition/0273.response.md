Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is 'S', and the character at position `i` in `xx` and index `j - 1` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.** 

The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`, which was initially an empty string. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
