Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters at each index across all input strings, respectively. `xx` is a list containing `n` user input strings. `sa` and `sb` are lists containing indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, respectively, with the length of `sa` being less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` contains the value `j`. The variable `nx` is now an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nx = ''` reassigns the variable `nx` to an empty string.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged.
- The condition about `nx` being built by iterating through `xx[1]` and appending characters based on certain conditions is no longer relevant because `nx` is now explicitly set to an empty string.
