To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `xx` is a list containing `n` strings.
- `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0.
- `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`.
- The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string constructed by iterating through each character in `xx[2]` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character:
  - If it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`.
  - If it is '?', and either `i` (which is 2) or the current index `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `sa` and `sb`:**
   - `sa` contains indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, or both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0.
   - `sb` contains indices where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`.
   - The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.

2. **Identify the First Quarter of `sa`:**
   - The first quarter of `sa` consists of the first \(\left\lceil \frac{\text{len}(sa)}{4} \right\rceil\) elements of `sa`.

3. **Construct the String `nx`:**
   - Iterate through each character in `xx[2]` from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each character:
     - If it is not '?', append it to `nx`.
     - If it is '?':
       - Check if `i` (which is 2) or the current index `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.
       - If so, append 'F' to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, append 'S' to `nx`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 5` for simplicity:
- `xx[2]` could be a string like "A?B?C?D?".
- Suppose `sa` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `sb` is `[6]`.

#### Constructing `nx`:
- `i` is 2.
- The first quarter of `sa` is `[1]` (since \(\left\lceil \frac{5}{4} \right\rceil = 1\)).

Iterate through `xx[2]`:
- Character 'A' (index 0): Not '?', append 'A'.
- Character '?' (index 1): Current index `j` is 1, which is in the first quarter of `sa`, append 'F'.
- Character 'B' (index 2): Not '?', append 'B'.
- Character '?' (index 3): Current index `j` is 2, which is not in the first quarter of `sa`, append 'S'.
- Character 'C' (index 4): Not '?', append 'C'.
- Character '?' (index 5): Current index `j` is 3, which is not in the first quarter of `sa`, append 'S'.

Thus, `nx` becomes "AFBSCS".

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the construction logic, the output will be the string `nx` constructed as described.

Output: **AFBSCS (where the exact string depends on the specific values of `xx[2]`, `sa`, and `n`)**
