Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 3, `nx` is determined based on the conditions involving `xx[1]`, `i`, and `j`. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` ends with the character 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` includes the character 'S' appended to its original value.***
