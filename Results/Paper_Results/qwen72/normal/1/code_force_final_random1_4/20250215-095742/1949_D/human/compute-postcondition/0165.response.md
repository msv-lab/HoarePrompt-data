Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 2, and `nx` is updated as follows: If the character at index 0 of `xx[2]` is not '?', then `nx` is the first character of `xx[2]` followed by the character at index 1 of `xx[2]`. If the character at index 0 of `xx[2]` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. If the character at index 0 of `xx[2]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is 'S'.**
