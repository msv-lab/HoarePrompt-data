Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'F', otherwise it remains unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'S', otherwise it remains unchanged, `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`, `x` is the user input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'F', otherwise it remains unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'S', otherwise it remains unchanged, `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`, `x` is the user input string, `j` is 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', the element at index 1 of `a` is incremented by 1 and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by 4. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1`. `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`, and `x` is the user input string, `j` is 2. If the character at index 1 of `x` (i.e., `x[1]`) is 'F', the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'S', the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions. Additionally, if the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', the element at index 1 of `a` is incremented by 1 and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by 4. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`, `x` is the user input string, `j` is 3. If the third character of `x` (i.e., `x[2]`) is 'F', then `a[2]` and `a[3]` are each incremented by 1. If the third character of `x` (i.e., `x[2]`) is 'S', then `b[2]` and `b[3]` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
