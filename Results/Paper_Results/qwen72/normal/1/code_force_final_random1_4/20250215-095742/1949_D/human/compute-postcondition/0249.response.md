Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, `nx` is now a string that includes the character 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.***
