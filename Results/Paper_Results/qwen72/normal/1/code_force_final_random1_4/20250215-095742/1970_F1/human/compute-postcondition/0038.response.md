To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the parameter `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `i` would have reached the value `n` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`).
4. **Adjust the state for another iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to a value that is less than `n`. However, since the loop has already completed, `i` is currently equal to `n`.

Given this, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to reset `i` to a value that is less than `n`. Typically, this would mean setting `i` back to 0 or another appropriate starting value.

However, since the problem specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not provide a mechanism to reset `i` (it is managed by the `range` function), we can only consider the conditions under which the loop would execute again if it were to start over.

Thus, the state adjustment needed is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
