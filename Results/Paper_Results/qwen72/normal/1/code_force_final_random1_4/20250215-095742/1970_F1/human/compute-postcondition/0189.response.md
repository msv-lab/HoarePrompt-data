Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.***
