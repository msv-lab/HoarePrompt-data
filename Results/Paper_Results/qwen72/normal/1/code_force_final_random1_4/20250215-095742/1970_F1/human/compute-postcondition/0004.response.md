Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, with new values read from the input. `grid` is an empty list. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two empty lists.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within the range 3 to 99 and are odd, with new values read from the input.
- `grid` is an empty list.
- `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1).
- `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary.
- The code snippet initializes `goal` to a list containing two empty lists, which does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated `goal` variable.
