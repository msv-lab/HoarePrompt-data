N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both are odd; P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10; T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair represents a cell in the field. The pairs can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, and ".Q" for the Quaffle. The actions are a list of T strings, each describing an action in the format specified in the problem description.
