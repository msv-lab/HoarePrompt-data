Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.**

Explanation:
- The code `command = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings.
- This operation updates the `command` variable to the new list of strings.
- The values of `t` and `time` remain unchanged, so they retain their initial properties: `t` is greater than 0, and `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.
- No other variables are mentioned or modified in this code snippet, so their initial states remain valid.
