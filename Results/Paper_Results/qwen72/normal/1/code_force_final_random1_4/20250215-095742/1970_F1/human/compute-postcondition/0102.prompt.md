Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, with new values read from the input. `grid` is an empty list. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. `points` is a list with values [0, 0].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, the following state is reached:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least `len(line)` substrings, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. For each index `k` in `range(len(line))`, if `line[k]` is not equal to '..': `elements` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[k]` and the value is `(0, k)`. If `line[k]` is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[k]` and the value is `False`. If `line[k]` is not a player and the second character of `line[k]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[k]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains a list of tuples `(0, k)` for all such `k`. If any `line[k]` is equal to '..', the state for that `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `line` is a list of substrings read from standard input with at least `len(line)` elements, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for all non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, each mapped to `(1, index)`. `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for all player substrings in the new `line`, each with the value `False`. `goal` contains lists of tuples for all substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`. For each substring ending in 'G', if the first character is 'B', the tuple is added to `goal[0]`; otherwise, it is added to `goal[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
