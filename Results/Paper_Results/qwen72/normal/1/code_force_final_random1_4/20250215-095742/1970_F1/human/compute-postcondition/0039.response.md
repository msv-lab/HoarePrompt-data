The line of code reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the resulting string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This operation does not affect the variables `i` and `n`, but it introduces a new variable `line` which holds the list of substrings.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings from the input line.**
