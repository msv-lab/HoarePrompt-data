The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by the condition that `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0. Since `obj` is the first element of `command`, and `command` is a list of strings with length 3, `obj` is a string. The value of `el` is ".S", which does not affect the calculation of `team`.

Therefore, if `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1, and `points[1]` is incremented by 10. If `obj[0]` is not 'B', `team` is 0, and `points[0]` is incremented by 10.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings with length 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is incremented by 10.**
