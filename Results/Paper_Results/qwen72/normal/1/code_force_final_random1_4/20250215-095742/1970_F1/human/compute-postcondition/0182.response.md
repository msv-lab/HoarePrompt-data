To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`command`**: A list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.

2. **`t`**: A positive integer.
   - `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.

3. **`pos`**: The value of `elements[obj]`.

4. **`nxt`**: A tuple calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.

5. **`player`**: 
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`time`**:
   - `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.
   - Therefore, `time` is a positive integer that is less than `t`.

2. **`player`**:
   - `player` is determined based on the value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`.
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

### Possible Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`:
  - `player` will be `obj`.
  - The output will be: `time obj ELIMINATED`.

- **Scenario 2**: If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`:
  - `player` will be `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
  - The output will be: `time grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] ELIMINATED`.

### Final Output:

Since the exact values of `time`, `obj`, and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **%d %s ELIMINATED (where %d is the value of time and %s is the value of player, which is either obj if isPlayer(obj) returns True, or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] otherwise)**
