The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it is implied that the function internally uses two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are odd and within the range of 3 to 99. The specific output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation using `n` and `m` and returns a result based on these values.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters but internally uses two odd integers `n` and `m` within the range 3 to 99. It returns a result based on these values, though the specific output is not specified.**
