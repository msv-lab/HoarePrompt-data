Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - An error occurs due to incorrect unpacking, so `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3.
   - `pos` is not assigned because `elements[obj]` cannot be accessed.
   - `nxt` is not assigned.
   - Either `obj` is not equal to '.B' or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false.
   - Either `isPlayer(obj)` is false or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
   - The current value of `com` is 'T'.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
   - The current value of `goalIn(pos)` is not -1.
   - `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `time`: The value of `time` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a valid integer greater than 0.
   - `GoalName[team]`: `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. Therefore, `team` is a valid index in the `GoalName` list.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `time` is greater than 0 and `team` is a valid index in `GoalName`, the print statement will format the output using these values.
   - The exact value of `time` is not specified, so we will represent it as `time`.
   - The exact value of `GoalName[team]` depends on the content of the `GoalName` list and the value of `team`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **%d %s GOAL (where %d is the value of time and %s is the value of GoalName[team])**
