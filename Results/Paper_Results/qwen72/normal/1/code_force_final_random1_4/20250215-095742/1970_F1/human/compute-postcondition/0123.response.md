Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- An error occurs due to incorrect unpacking, so `t` must be greater than 0.
- `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3.
- `pos` is not assigned because `elements[obj]` cannot be accessed.
- `nxt` is not assigned.
- If `obj` is a player, `player` is set to `obj`.
- Otherwise, if `obj` is equal to `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Error and Unpacking**: The error indicates that there is an issue with unpacking, but it does not affect the value of `t` directly. We know `t` must be greater than 0.
2. **Command Length**: The length of `command` is not equal to 3, which means the command list does not have exactly three elements.
3. **Unassigned Variables**: `pos` and `nxt` are not assigned because of the error in accessing `elements[obj]`.
4. **Player Assignment**:
   - If `obj` is a player, `player` is set to `obj`.
   - If `obj` is equal to `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Given the conditions, let's consider the possible values of `player`:
- If `obj` is a player, `player` will be set to `obj`.
- If `obj` is `.B` and `nxt` is not assigned, the second condition cannot be met, so `player` will not be set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Since `nxt` is not assigned, the second condition is not valid. Therefore, `player` will only be set if `obj` is a player.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

### Final Output:
- `time` is a variable that must be greater than 0.
- `player` will be the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player. If `obj` is not a player, `player` will be `None` or some other undefined value, but based on the precondition, we assume `obj` is a player.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[time] [player] ELIMINATED (where time is the value of t and player is the value of obj if obj is a player)**
