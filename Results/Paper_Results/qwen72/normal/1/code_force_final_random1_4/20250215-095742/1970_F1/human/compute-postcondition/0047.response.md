Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `ind` is 0, `grid` contains `line` as its last element, and the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..'; `elements` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is a tuple `(0, 0)`. Additionally, `line[ind]` is not a player, and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G'.**
