The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, which is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is now `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**
