Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings from the input line, `grid` contains `line` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `ind` is 0, and `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..': `elements` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is a tuple `(0, 0)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal` now contains a key `1` with a value that is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)` as its first element. If the first element of `line` is equal to '..', the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `ind` is 1, and `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If `line[1]` is not equal to '..': `elements` now contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[1]` and the value is `(0, 1)`. Additionally, if the first element of `line` is not equal to '..': `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `(0, 0)`. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal` now contains a key `1` with a value that is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)` as its first element. If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `goal` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)` as its second element. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. If `line[1]` is equal to '..', the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 2 substrings, `ind` is 2, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If `line[2]` is not equal to '..': `elements` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[2]` and the value is `(0, 2)`. If `line[1]` is not equal to '..': `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[1]` and the value is `(0, 1)`. If the first element of `line` is not equal to '..': `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `(0, 0)`. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs where the keys are the first element of `line` and `line[2]`, and the values are `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal` contains a key `1` with a value that is a list of tuples `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(0, 2)`. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, and `goal` contains a key `0` with a value that is a list containing the tuple `(0, 2)`. If `line[2]` is equal to '..', the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
