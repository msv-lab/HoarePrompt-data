Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, with new values read from the input. `grid` is an empty list. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. `points` is a list with values [0, 0].**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within the range 3 to 99, both inclusive, and they are odd. They are also updated with new values read from the input, which means their specific values are now determined by the input.
- `grid` remains an empty list.
- `elements` remains a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1).
- `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary.
- `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.
- The code snippet initializes a new list `points` with two elements, both set to 0. This changes the state of the `points` variable from undefined to [0, 0].
