Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from standard input to simulate a game. It initializes a grid based on the dimensions `n` and `m`, which are odd integers between 3 and 99. The function processes a series of commands over `t` turns, updating the positions of players and a ball, and managing game events such as scoring goals, catching the golden snitch, and eliminating players. After processing all commands, it prints the final scores for two teams. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the final state of the game, including the scores and any relevant game events. **
