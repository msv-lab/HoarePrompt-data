Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1), and the key `line[ind]` with the value (0, 2) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has a key which is the first element of `line` and the value (0, 0), and a key `line[1]` with the value (0, 1). `points` is a list with values [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 2. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[ind]` and the value `False`. If the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. If the second character of the first element of `line` is not 'G', then `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists and `tmp` is not modified. Additionally, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false and the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1) appended to its existing list. If `line[ind]` is '..', `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` remain unchanged. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, and if the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuples (0, 0) and (0, 1) appended to its existing list.**
