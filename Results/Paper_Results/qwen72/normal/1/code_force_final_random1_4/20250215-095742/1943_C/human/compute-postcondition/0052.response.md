The code appends the tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 2, and `c` must be at least 1, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 2)`. The previous tuples in `ops` are `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, so after appending, `ops` will contain `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `ci` must be at least 1, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`**.
