Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 2, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, `u` and `v` are now integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The value of `u` is decreased by 1 again, so it is now decreased by 2 in total.
- All other conditions remain unchanged.
