Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element (duplicated), `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, `u` and `v` are updated to the new integers from the input, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element (duplicated).**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`.
- Since `u2vs[v]` already contained `u` as an additional element, `u` is now duplicated in `u2vs[v]`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
