You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist represents the neighbors of a vertex in the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `_` is `n-2`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex.

    #State: The loop continues to append the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` until it encounters `-1`. At this point, the loop terminates. The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the sequence of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`). The variable `n` will be `-1`, indicating the end of the path. The variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.

        #State: `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9, `i` is the last valid index in the range, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing tuples for each valid `i` in the range, specifically `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.

    #The program returns `None`.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It modifies the `path_ba` list to contain the sequence of predecessors from `b` to the root vertex (indicated by `-1`). It also updates the `ops` list based on the length of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`. If the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 9, `ops` contains tuples `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each valid index `i`. The function returns `None`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
