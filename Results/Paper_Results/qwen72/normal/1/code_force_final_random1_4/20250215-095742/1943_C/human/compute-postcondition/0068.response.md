To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- The loop appends the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` until it encounters `-1`.
- The final state of `path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`).
- The variable `n` is `-1`, indicating the end of the path.
- The variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.

### Conditions:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `i` is `ci`.
  - `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9.
  - `i` is the last valid index in the range.
  - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
  - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
  - `n` is `-1`.
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples for each valid `i` in the range, specifically `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Length of `path_ba`**:
   - The length of `path_ba` is determined by the loop that appends predecessors until `-1` is encountered. Since the length of `path_ba` is at least 9, it must be either an odd number or an even number greater than or equal to 9.

2. **Odd Length**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` is `ci + 1`.

3. **Even Length**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - For each valid `i` in the range, `ops` contains tuples `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` is twice the number of valid indices, which is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.

### Conclusion:
- Since the length of `path_ba` is at least 9, let's consider both cases:
  - **Odd Length**: If the length of `path_ba` is odd, say 9, then `ci` would be 4 (since `ci` is the last valid index). Therefore, `ops` would contain 5 tuples.
  - **Even Length**: If the length of `path_ba` is even, say 10, then `c2` would be 5. For each valid `i` in the range, there are two tuples, so `ops` would contain 10 tuples.

Given that the length of `path_ba` is at least 9 and the problem specifies that if the length is even, it must be at least 9, the most precise and general answer is for the even case.

### Final Output:
Output: **length of path_ba / 2 * 2 (where the length of path_ba is even and at least 9)**

However, since the length of `path_ba` is at least 9 and even, the number of tuples in `ops` will be exactly the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **length of path_ba (where the length of path_ba is even and at least 9)**
