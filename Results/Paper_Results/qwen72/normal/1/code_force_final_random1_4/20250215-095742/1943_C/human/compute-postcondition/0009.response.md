Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, `u` and `v` are now integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `_`, `u2vs[u]`, and `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged.
- The variables `u` and `v` are updated to the integers obtained from the input, split by spaces.
