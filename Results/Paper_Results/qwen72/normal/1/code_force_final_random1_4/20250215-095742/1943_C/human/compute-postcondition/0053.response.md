Output State: **`i` is `ci`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`, inclusive. This means the loop will run `ci + 1` times.
- Each iteration appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `ci`.
- The list `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.

So, the final state of `ops` will be a list of tuples starting from `(c, 0)` up to `(c, ci)`. The value of `i` will be `ci` after the loop completes.
