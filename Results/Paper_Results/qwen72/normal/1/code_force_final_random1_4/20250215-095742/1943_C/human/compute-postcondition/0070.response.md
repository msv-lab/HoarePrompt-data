Output State: **The program returns `None`. The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the sequence of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`). The variable `n` will be `-1`, indicating the end of the path. The variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `i` is `ci`, and `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9, `i` is the last valid index in the range, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples for each valid `i` in the range, specifically `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.**
