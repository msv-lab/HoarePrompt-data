Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, calling `func_1(i)` for each `i` to get the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to `sum`, and the current value of `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` using `num % 10` and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit using `int(num / 10)`.
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0, at which point the function returns `a`, the sum of the digits.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n - 1`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200000.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by directly accessing the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number.
   - The precomputation step correctly builds the list `A` with the cumulative sums of the digit sums.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by efficiently retrieving the precomputed results.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
