### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, computing the sum of the digits of each number using the function `func_1`.
   - For each number `i`, it adds the result of `func_1(i)` to `sum` and appends the current value of `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` and add it to `a`, then removes the last digit by integer division.
   - The function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n-1`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200000.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by accessing the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sums in the list `A`.
   - For each test case, it retrieves the correct precomputed sum in constant time.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. It efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
