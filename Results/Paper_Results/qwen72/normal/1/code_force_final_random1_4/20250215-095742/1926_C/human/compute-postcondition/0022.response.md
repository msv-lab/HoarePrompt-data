The code snippet `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- `N` must be greater than `n + 1`.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

After executing the code snippet:

- The value of `pd[i]` (which is `pd[n + 1]`) is updated to `pd[n + 1] + pd[n]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `N` must be greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`. `i` is `n + 1`, and `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n]`.**
