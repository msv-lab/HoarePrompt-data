Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Precomputation of Sums**: The program precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in the list `A`. This is efficient because it avoids recalculating the same values multiple times for different test cases.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`. It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit (`num % 10`) and adding it to the sum `a`, then removing the last digit (`num // 10`).

3. **Efficient Querying**: For each test case, the program reads the input `n` and prints the precomputed sum `A[n - 1]`. This is very efficient because it is a constant-time lookup.

4. **Time Complexity**: The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. Each test case is handled in O(1) time, which is well within the 0.5-second time limit for up to 10,000 test cases.

5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the list `A`, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
