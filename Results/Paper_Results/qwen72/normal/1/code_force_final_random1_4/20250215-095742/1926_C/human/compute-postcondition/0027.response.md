To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- `N` is greater than `n + 1`.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + 2 * int(j)`, where `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string representation of `i`.
- The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `str(i)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is derived from `str(i)`.
- The loop will execute for each character in `str(i)`, so we need to consider the next character in the string representation of `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**: `i` is `n + 1`.
2. **String Representation**: `str(i)` is the string representation of `n + 1`.
3. **Next Character**: The next character in `str(i)` is the first character of the string representation of `n + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `pd` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, the next character `j` in `str(i)` is the first character of the string representation of `n + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the first character in the string representation of `n + 1`**.
