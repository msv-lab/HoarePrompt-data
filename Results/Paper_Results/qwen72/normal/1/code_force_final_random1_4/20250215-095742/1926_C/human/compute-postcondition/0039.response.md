To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant details:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `N` is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list of 200001 integers.
   - `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Understanding `pd[i]`:**
   - For each index `i` from 1 to 200000, `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
   - For example, if `i` is 5, then `pd[5]` would be the sum of the digits of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

3. **Execution of `print(pd[n])`:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `pd[n]`.
   - Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `pd[n]` depends on the specific value of `n`.

Given the initial state and the definition of `pd`, the output will be the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n)**
