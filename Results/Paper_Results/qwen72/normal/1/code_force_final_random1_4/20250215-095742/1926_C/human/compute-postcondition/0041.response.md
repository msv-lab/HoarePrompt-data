The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, given the context of the parameter constraints (`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), it suggests that the function likely processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such functions would return a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
