Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a binary string of length 1 to 500 characters, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After the loop has executed all iterations, `s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is the total number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different. If `flag` is True, indicating there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`, then `count` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `flag` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent pairs in `s` where the characters are different plus 1, and `flag` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1'. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of adjacent pairs in `s` where the characters are different.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different plus 1, and `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different, and `flag` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
