Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different plus 1, and `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different, and `flag` remains True.***
