The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `t` and `v`, respectively. This impacts the values of `t` and `v` based on the new input. The initial state specifies conditions for `t` and actions based on its value, but since `t` and `v` are reassigned, these conditions and actions are no longer relevant until further code is executed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, and `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**
