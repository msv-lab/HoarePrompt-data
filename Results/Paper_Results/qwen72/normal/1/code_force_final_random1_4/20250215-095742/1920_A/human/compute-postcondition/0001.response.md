Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, and num is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `start = -1` reassigns the value of `start` to `-1`. Since `start` was already `-1` in the initial state, there is no change in the value of `start`. The values of `n`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
