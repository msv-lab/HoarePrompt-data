Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint. It initializes `start` and `end` to represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k`, respectively.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it appends `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid numbers from this total.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0, indicating no valid integers.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `start` is greater than `end` by returning 0.
   - It ensures that the final count is non-negative by using a conditional check.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
