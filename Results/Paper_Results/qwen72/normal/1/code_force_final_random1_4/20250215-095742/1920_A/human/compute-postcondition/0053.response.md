The code snippet `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `count_num` is only incremented if `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end`, this condition is assumed to be true.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is the next element in `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, and `count_num` is increased by 1.**
