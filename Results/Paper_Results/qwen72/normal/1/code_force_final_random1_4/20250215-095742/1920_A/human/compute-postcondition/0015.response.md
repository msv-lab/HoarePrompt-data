Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `t` is either 1 or 2, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to be equal to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is updated to be equal to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged.***
