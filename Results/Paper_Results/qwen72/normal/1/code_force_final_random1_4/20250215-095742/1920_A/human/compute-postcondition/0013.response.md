Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `t` is 2, `v` is an input integer, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is now equal to `v`.** 

Explanation: The value of `end` is updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions for updating `start` are not met because `t` is 2, not 1. Therefore, `start` remains unchanged.
