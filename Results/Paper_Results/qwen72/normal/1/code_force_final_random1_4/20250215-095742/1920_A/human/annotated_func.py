#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, the function prompts the user to enter an integer and returns that integer. If `isOne` is `True`, the function returns the integer 1. In both cases, the function returns an integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether to split the input by spaces, to_int is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean indicating whether to split the input by spaces, `to_int` is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers, `line` is the user input string. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from the string `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the substrings in `items`. `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace, as `space` is `True` and `to_int` is `True`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of characters from the string `line` since `space` is `False` and `to_int` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is `True`, it splits the input into a list of substrings based on whitespace. If `space` is `False`, it converts the input into a list of individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, it converts each item in the list to an integer before returning it. Otherwise, it returns the list of substrings or characters directly. In summary, the function returns either a list of integers (if both `space` and `to_int` are `True`) or a list of strings (either substrings or characters, depending on the value of `space`).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and sym is a string.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list of elements that can be converted to strings, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `string` is a concatenation of each element of `arr` converted to a string followed by `sym`, and `sym` remains a string.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is a concatenation of each element of `arr` converted to a string followed by `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string. It returns a single string where each element of `arr` is converted to a string and concatenated together, with `sym` inserted between each element. The original list `arr` and the string `sym` remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_4(string, substring):

        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `indices` is a list containing all the starting positions of `substring` in `string`, and `index` is `-1`.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list containing all the starting positions of `substring` in `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, where `string` is a string and `substring` is a non-empty string. It returns a list containing all the starting positions (indices) of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where each index corresponds to the position in the list `arr` where the value equals `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `element`, an integer. It returns a list of indices where each index corresponds to the position in the list `arr` where the value equals `element`. If no such elements exist, it returns an empty list. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is a non-negative integer, and value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: The loop has executed through all sub-arrays in `arr`. If any sub-array in `arr` had an element at position `index` equal to `value`, the loop would have returned that sub-array, and the function would have terminated. If no such sub-array was found, the loop completes without returning any sub-array, and the function continues or ends depending on the code that follows the loop. The variables `arr`, `index`, and `value` remain unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sub-array in `arr` had an element at position `index` equal to `value`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sub-array in `arr` to find the first sub-array where the element at position `index` is equal to `value`. If such a sub-array is found, it is returned. If no sub-array meets this condition, the function returns `None`. The function does not modify the input parameters `arr`, `index`, or `value`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start is initialized to -1, end is initialized to 1000000000.0, and num is an empty list.

The list `num` contains all the integers `v` that were input with `t` == 3 during the loop's execution. The variable `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. The variable `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0.

    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then processes `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)` from user input. It updates two boundary values, `start` and `end`, based on the type of operation specified by `t` (1, 2, or 3). If `t` is 1, it updates `start` to the maximum value of `v` encountered. If `t` is 2, it updates `end` to the minimum value of `v` encountered. If `t` is 3, it appends `v` to a list `num`. After processing all inputs, the function counts how many elements in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that fall within this range, provided this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
