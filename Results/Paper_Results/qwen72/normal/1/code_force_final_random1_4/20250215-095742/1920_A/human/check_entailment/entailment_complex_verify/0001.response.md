Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_7` correctly reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint. This is done using a loop that reads each line of input and splits it into the constraint type `t` and the value `v`. The annotated code confirms that the input is handled correctly.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), the function updates the `start` variable to the maximum of its current value and `v`. This ensures that `start` holds the highest lower bound.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), the function updates the `end` variable to the minimum of its current value and `v`. This ensures that `end` holds the lowest upper bound.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the function appends `v` to the `num` list, which keeps track of all values that `k` cannot be.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The function initializes `count_num` to 0, which will count how many of the values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It iterates over the `num` list and increments `count_num` for each value that is within the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there is no valid integer `k` that satisfies all constraints, so the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the number of invalid values (`count_num`). The result is returned.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `start` is greater than `end` correctly by returning 0.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are no invalid values in the range by returning the total number of integers in the range.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. The function correctly processes all types of constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k`.

Given this reasoning and the detailed annotations, the provided program is correct.

Final: **True**
