The value of `count_num` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is the next element in `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
