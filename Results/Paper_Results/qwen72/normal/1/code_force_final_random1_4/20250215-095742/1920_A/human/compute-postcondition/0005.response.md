The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `t` and `v`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `t` and `v` are determined by the user's input, while `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `t` and `v` are input integers.**
