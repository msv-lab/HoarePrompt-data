Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input, `num` now includes `v`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is updated to be equal to `v`. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to be equal to `v`. Otherwise, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**
