The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that none of the variables are updated by this statement, and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, `count_num` is 0, and `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.**
