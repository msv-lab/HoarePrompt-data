Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, and `v` is the second integer from input. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.***
