The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is already given as an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, this ensures that `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, to clearly state the conditions under which the loop will execute, we can specify that `n` must be within the given range and `i` will start from 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0**
