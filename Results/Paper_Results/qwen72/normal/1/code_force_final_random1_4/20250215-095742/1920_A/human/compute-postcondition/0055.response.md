Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is the last element in `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, and `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` iterates through each element in `num`, and after the loop completes, `i` will be the last element in `num`.
- The variables `t` and `v` are not modified within the loop and retain their last input values.
- The list `num` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified.
- The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `count_num` is incremented for each element in `num` that falls within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), so after the loop completes, `count_num` will be the total number of such elements.
