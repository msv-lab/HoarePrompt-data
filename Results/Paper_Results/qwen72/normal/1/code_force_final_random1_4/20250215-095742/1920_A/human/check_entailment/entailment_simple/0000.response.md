Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and processes each constraint accordingly.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - **Type 1 Constraints (k ≥ x)**: The program updates the `start` variable to the maximum value of `x` encountered. This ensures that `k` must be at least as large as the largest lower bound.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (k ≤ x)**: The program updates the `end` variable to the minimum value of `x` encountered. This ensures that `k` must be at most as small as the smallest upper bound.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (k ≠ x)**: The program appends the value of `x` to the `num` list, which keeps track of all values that `k` cannot be.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0 because no integer can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the number of invalid values (those in `num` that fall within the range).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `start` and `end` are such that no valid `k` exists.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are no invalid values in the range.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
