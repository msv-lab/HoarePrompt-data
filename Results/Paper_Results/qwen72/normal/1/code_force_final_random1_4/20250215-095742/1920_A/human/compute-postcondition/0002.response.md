Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, and num is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `end = 1000000000.0` does not change the value of `end` because it is already set to `1000000000.0` in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
