Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be the sum of `x + y - 2` and the total number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus the sum of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, `tmp` will contain the values of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, and now also contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `y` will be decremented by the sum of half the differences minus one for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, and the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2, the expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` is true, and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
