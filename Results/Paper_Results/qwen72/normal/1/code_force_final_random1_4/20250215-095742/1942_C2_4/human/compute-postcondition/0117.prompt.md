Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list. The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If the difference between the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between the last two elements of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus one, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is either `x + y` or `x + y - 1` depending on the conditions described, `tmp` is either an empty list or contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` depending on the conditions described, and `y` is either unchanged or decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` depending on the conditions described. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1` or `x + y - 2` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` is updated to a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If none of these conditions are met, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, and `tmp` remains either an empty list or contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` depending on the initial conditions, while `y` remains either unchanged or decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` depending on the initial conditions. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] != 2` and `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` or `x + y - 1 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` depending on the initial conditions, and `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
