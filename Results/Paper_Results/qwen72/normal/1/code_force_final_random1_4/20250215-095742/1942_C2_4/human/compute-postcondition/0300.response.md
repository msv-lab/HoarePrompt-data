Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least two elements. If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * y`, `y` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans + gap`, and `y` is `y - gap // 2` (or 0 if `y < gap // 2` after the decrement).***
