Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set representing a test case. For each test case, it takes four inputs: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function then processes these inputs to compute a value `ans` based on the following logic: it adjusts the list of integers, sorts them, and calculates gaps between consecutive elements. It updates `ans` based on the gaps and the value of `y`. Finally, it prints the computed value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the printed results for each test case, and the internal variables used in the computation are reset for each new test case. **
