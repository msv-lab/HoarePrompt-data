Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least one element, `y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + 4 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The values of `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in.
