Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[x - 1] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap` appended to it. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. The lists `odd` and `even` will contain all the gaps that meet their respective conditions for each iteration of the loop. The `odd` list is now sorted in ascending order. The `even` list is now sorted in ascending order. All other variables (`odd`, `even`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `st`, `ans`, `t`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order). If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * y + gap`, `y` is set to `y - gap // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `st`, `t`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + gap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is incremented by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
