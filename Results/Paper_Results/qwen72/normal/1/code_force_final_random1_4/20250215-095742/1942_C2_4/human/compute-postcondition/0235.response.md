Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `gap` is appended to the list `odd`.
- All other variables (`i`, `x`, `next_elem`, `gap`) remain unchanged.
- The list `odd` now includes the value of `gap`.
