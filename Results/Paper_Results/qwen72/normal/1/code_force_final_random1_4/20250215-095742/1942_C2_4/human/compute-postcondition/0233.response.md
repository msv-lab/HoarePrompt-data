Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `x` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `next_elem` remains as defined: `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, otherwise `a[1]`.
- The new variable `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[0] - 1`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`.
