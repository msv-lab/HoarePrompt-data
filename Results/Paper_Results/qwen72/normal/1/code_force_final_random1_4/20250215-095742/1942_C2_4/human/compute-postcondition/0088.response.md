Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was a sorted list of integers in ascending order, but after executing the code, `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `ans`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
