The code assigns a value to `next_elem` based on a condition. If `i` is equal to `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`. Otherwise, `next_elem` is set to `a[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `x` must be greater than 0

Let's evaluate the condition:
- `i == x - 1` translates to `0 == x - 1`, which simplifies to `x == 1`.

Since `x` must be greater than 0, there are two cases:
1. If `x` is exactly 1, then `i == x - 1` is true, and `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`.
2. If `x` is greater than 1, then `i == x - 1` is false, and `next_elem` is set to `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[1]`.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `x`:
- If `x` is 1, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- If `x` is greater than 1, then `next_elem` is `a[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`.**
