Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, n, x, and y are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    ans = x - 2
    st = set(a)
    a.sort()
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
            ans += 1
    odd = []
    even = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
            odd.append(gap)
        elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
            even.append(gap)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    for gap in odd:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    for gap in even:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list provided by the user, `st` is a set containing the unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `x` is greater than 0, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `x - 2 + (k-1) + sum(odd) + 2 * y_initial - sum(gap // 2 for gap in odd) + sum(even)`, `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `even`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 0 and even, `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(even)`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem` remain unchanged, `gap` is the last element of `even`, `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, and `y` is `y - sum([gap // 2 for gap in even])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element of `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + sum(even) - sum(gap // 2 for gap in even)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
