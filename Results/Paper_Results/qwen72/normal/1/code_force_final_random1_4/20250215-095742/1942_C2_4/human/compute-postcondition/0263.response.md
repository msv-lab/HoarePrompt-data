Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order). If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * y`, `y` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `st`, `t`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.***
