Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is incremented by `gap`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += gap` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `gap`.
- The values of `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, and `even` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if y < gap // 2` and the subsequent logic for updating `y` and `ans` are not executed because the given code snippet only includes `ans += gap`.
- Therefore, the only change in the state is the increment of `ans` by `gap`.
