Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but is expected to work with predefined inputs within the function. It processes a scenario where a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, each involving integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (with constraints 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x) and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing vertices chosen by Bessie. The function returns a result based on these inputs, though the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.**
