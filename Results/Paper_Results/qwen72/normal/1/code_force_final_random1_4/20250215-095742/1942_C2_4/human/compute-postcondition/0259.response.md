Postcondition: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), all other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `st`, `ans`, `t`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states, and `y` is less than half of the first element of `odd`.**
