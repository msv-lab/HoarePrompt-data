The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true. Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.** 

However, to be more precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` and `k` are input integers. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true. Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.**
