### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A diagonal in this context can be either a main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) or an anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each cell in the grid can belong to exactly two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each colored cell.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). If so, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**:
     - If \( k \) is equal to the total number of diagonals, we need to cover all diagonals.
     - Since each cell covers 2 diagonals, we need at least \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 \) cells to ensure all diagonals are covered. This is because the last cell will cover the remaining diagonals.
     - The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) correctly calculates this.
   - **Case 2: \( k < 4n - 2 \)**:
     - If \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals, we need to cover at least \( k \) diagonals.
     - Since each cell covers 2 diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells to cover \( k \) diagonals.
     - The formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) correctly calculates this.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where \( k \) is very small (e.g., \( k = 1 \)) and very large (e.g., \( k = 4n - 2 \)).
   - The constraints \( 1 \le t \le 1000 \), \( 2 \le n \le 10^8 \), and \( 1 \le k \le 4n - 2 \) are respected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells needed to be colored to cover at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid. The reasoning and the implementation match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
