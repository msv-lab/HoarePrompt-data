Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the content of the fourth line, `n` is the first integer from splitting `s`, and `k` is the second integer from splitting `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, then `k` retains this value. If `k` is greater than `4 * n - 4`, then `k` retains its original value unless it is specifically `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, in which case `k` also retains these values.***
