The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This overrides the previous values of `n` and `k` with the new input values. The relationship between `4 * n - 2` and `k` will depend on these new values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, if `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true. Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.**
