The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.

Given these constraints, the function's output is not specified in the problem statement. However, typically, functions with such constraints are expected to perform some computation or check based on the input parameters and return a result accordingly.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, inclusive. `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, inclusive. The function performs a computation or check based on these parameters and returns a result.**
