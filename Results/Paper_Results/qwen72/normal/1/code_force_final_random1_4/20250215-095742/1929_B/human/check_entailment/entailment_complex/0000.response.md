Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid so that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program uses a simple logic to determine the number of cells to color based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).

1. **Special Case Handling**: When \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program correctly identifies that all diagonals need to be covered. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). This is because each diagonal can be covered by a single cell, but since the diagonals overlap at the center, one additional cell is needed to ensure all diagonals are covered.

2. **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the program uses \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) to determine the minimum number of cells. This is correct because each colored cell can cover up to two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

3. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading \( n \) and \( k \), then printing the result.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as \( k = 1 \) and \( k = 4n - 2 \) appropriately.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
