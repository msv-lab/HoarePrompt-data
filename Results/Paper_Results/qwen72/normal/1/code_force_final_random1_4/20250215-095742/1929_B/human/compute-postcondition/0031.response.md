The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` represents the size of the square grid, and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return some form of result or solution based on the given parameters.

Given the context, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, representing the size of the square grid), and `k` (an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given `n` and `k` for each test case.**
