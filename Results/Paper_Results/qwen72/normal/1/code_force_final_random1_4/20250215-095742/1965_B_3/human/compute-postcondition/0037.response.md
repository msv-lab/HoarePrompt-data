Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`. The contents of `ans` depend on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` is a list starting with [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\). If `k` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(k - 2^{(lk-1)}\), \(k + 1\), \(2 * k + 1\), \(2^{(lk-2)}\), \(2^{(lk-1)}\), ..., \(2^{(l-1)}\)], where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, and `lk` must be less than `l`.**
