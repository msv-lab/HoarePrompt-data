You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d` (a dictionary with integer keys and lists of integers as values), `processing` (a list of integers initialized to 0), `da` (an integer key present in `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers of the same length as `processing`). The function updates the `rank` list and returns an integer value. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`), updating the `rank` list and returning the minimum value obtained from these recursive calls plus 1. After the function completes, the `rank[da - 1]` is set to this minimum value plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, a calculated value based on the results of the recursive call, and the third element from the recursive call. The purpose of the function is to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact relationship is not specified in the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. In each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_14` generates a sequence that may not meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`. For example, consider the input `(n, k) = (8, 8)`:

- The program generates the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 1, 9, 17]`.
- However, the subsequence `[1, 2, 4, 1]` sums to `8`, which violates the condition that there should be no subsequence summing to `k`.

This indicates that the program does not correctly ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
