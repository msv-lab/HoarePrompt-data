### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_14()` reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case using `func_7()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.

2. **Logic for Constructing the Sequence:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `n == 2`, the function returns the string `'1\n2'`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\), where `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`.
   - **Case 2: `k != 1`**
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from 1 up to \(2^{(lk-2)}\), where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and continues appending powers of 2 from \(2^{(lk-2)}\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\).

3. **Output:**
   - The function `func_14()` returns a space-separated string of the constructed sequence.
   - `func_15()` iterates over the number of test cases and prints the result of `func_14()` for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Subsequence Sum Constraints:**
  - The sequence generated ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them.
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, ...]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence construction ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a subsequence sum, while all other values can be formed.

- **Sequence Length:**
  - The sequence length is at most 25, as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, constructs the sequence according to the problem requirements, and outputs the correct results for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
