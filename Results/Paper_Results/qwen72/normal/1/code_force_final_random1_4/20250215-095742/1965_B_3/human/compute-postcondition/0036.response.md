Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\), and `i` is `l`. If `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values \([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^{(lk-2)}, 2^{(lk-1)}, \ldots, 2^{(l-1)}]\), `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is \(l - 1\), and `lk` must be less than `l`.***
