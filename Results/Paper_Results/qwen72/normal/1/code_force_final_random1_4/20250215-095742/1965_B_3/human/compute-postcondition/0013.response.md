Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and must be greater than 4, `k` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16], `i` is 4.** 

The code appends the value of `2 ** i` (which is 16) to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
