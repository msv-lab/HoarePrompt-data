The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output.

- The function `func_14()` is called, and its return value is converted to a string.
- This string is then written to the standard output, followed by a newline character.
- The variable `_` remains unchanged at 1.
- The condition that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 is still valid.
- The return value of `func_14()` has now been printed to the standard output three times (it was already printed twice according to the initial state).

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 1, the return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output three times.**
