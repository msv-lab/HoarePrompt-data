### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_14**: This function generates the sequence `a` based on the given `n` and `k`.
     - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2` and returns `[1, 2]`.
     - For other values of `n` and `k`, it constructs the sequence using powers of 2 and specific adjustments to ensure the conditions are met.
   - **func_15**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence is constructed to handle the special case.
   - For other values of `k`, the sequence is constructed using powers of 2 and additional elements to ensure the sum conditions are met.
   - The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully choosing elements and their sums.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like `k == 1` and `n == 2` correctly.
   - The sequence construction ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the size of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Special Case Handling**:
  - When `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns `[1, 2]`, which is correct because it covers all values from 1 to 2 except 1 itself.
  - For other values of `k == 1`, the function constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding 1) can be formed by subsequences.

- **General Case Handling**:
  - For `k > 1`, the function constructs a sequence using powers of 2 up to `k-1`, then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum condition for `k` is not met.
  - It then adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover higher values and continues appending powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  - This ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by subsequences, and no subsequence sums to `k`.

- **Function 15**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases and iterates that many times, calling `func_14` for each test case and printing the results.
  - This matches the problem's requirement for handling multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates the required sequence for the given problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the sequence meets the specified conditions.
