Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is the final iteration index (one less than the number of iterations), and the return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output the same number of times as the number of iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the function `func_10()` must have returned a value that was at least as large as the number of times the loop ran. The loop variable `_` will be equal to the index of the last iteration (which is one less than the total number of iterations). Additionally, the return value of `func_14()` will have been printed to the standard output exactly as many times as the loop executed.
