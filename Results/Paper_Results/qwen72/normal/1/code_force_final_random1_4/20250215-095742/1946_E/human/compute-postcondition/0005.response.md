Output State: **The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a non-negative integer and `b <= a`, but the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`, this implies that `a` and `b` have swapped values or `a` has been updated to a value less than `b` before calling `func_1`. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are the outputs of `func_1` when called with `b` and `a` as arguments.**
