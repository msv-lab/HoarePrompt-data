Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a non-negative integer and `b <= a`, but the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`, this implies that `a` and `b` have swapped values or `a` has been updated to a value less than `b` before calling `func_1`. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are the outputs of `func_1` when called with `b` and `a` as arguments.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a, and b is not equal to 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -((a // b) - 1)), where `a` is a non-negative integer divisible by `b` with no remainder, and `b` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0 and less than or equal to `a`. The first element of the tuple is 1, and the second element is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a, b is not equal to 0, a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` and `c` are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `d` is the second result from `func_1`, and the second value in the tuple is calculated by subtracting the product of `a` divided by `b` (integer division) and `d` from `c`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a non-negative integer, and it is implied that a and b are related to the computation of permutations or their counts, possibly representing a count of permutations or a part of the permutation's structure.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is one of the results from the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `a` is an integer.
