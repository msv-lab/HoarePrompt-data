The code assigns the results of the function `func_1` called with arguments `b` and `a % b` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `a % b` will give us the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, which is a non-negative integer less than `b`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b <= a`.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.

After executing the code, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `b <= a`, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
