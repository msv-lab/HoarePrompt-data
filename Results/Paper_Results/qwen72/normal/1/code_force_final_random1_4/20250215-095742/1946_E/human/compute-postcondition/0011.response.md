Output State: **The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` and `c` are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `d` is the second result from `func_1`, and the second value in the tuple is calculated by subtracting the product of `a` divided by `b` (integer division) and `d` from `c`.**
