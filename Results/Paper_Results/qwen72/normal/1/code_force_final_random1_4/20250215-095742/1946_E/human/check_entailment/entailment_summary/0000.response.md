### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation:**
   - The program starts by precomputing factorials up to \(200,000\) and storing them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently computing combinations later in the program.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, followed by the lists of prefix maximums `p` and suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Initial Validity Check:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, and if the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is 1 and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program prints `0` because the permutation cannot exist under these constraints.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program uses the function `func_2` to compute combinations. The function `func_2` is designed to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the extended Euclidean algorithm implemented in `func_1`.
   - The combination \(C(n, k)\) is calculated as \( \frac{facts[n]}{facts[k] \times facts[n-k]} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

5. **Permutation Counting:**
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums `s` and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the gaps between the suffix maximums.
   - Similarly, it iterates over the prefix maximums `p` (in reverse order) and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the gaps between the prefix maximums.
   - Finally, it multiplies the number of ways to arrange the elements between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

6. **Final Result:**
   - The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given constraints. The use of precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic ensures that the calculations are efficient and correct. The initial validity check and the combination calculations are performed accurately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
