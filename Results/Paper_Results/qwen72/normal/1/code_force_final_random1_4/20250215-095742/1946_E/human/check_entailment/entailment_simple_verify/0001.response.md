Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function indeed implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to find the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It effectively computes \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\).

3. **Checking the Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program initializes a list of factorials up to \(200002\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is crucial for combinatorial calculations.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, and the lists of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It first checks if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, which is correct because the permutation cannot satisfy the given conditions.
   - It then calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic:
     - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the combinations using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function `func_2`.
     - It updates the number of remaining elements (`kol`) after each iteration.
     - It then processes the prefix maximums in reverse order, again using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function.
     - Finally, it multiplies the result by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums to account for the internal permutations within these segments.

4. **Combinatorial Logic**:
   - The program correctly uses combinatorial logic to count the number of valid permutations. It accounts for the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums and uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverses to efficiently calculate the combinations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions and the main logic are correctly implemented to solve the problem as stated. The program addresses the core combinatorial problem of counting permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

Final: **True**
