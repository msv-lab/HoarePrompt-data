Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. However, the annotated code reveals that these functions are part of a larger algorithm that does attempt to solve the problem.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

1. **Factorial Precomputation:**
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   This precomputes factorials up to \(200000!\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for combinatorial calculations later in the code.

2. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.

3. **Initial Validity Check:**
   ```python
   if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
       print(0)
   else:
   ```
   This checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, the first prefix maximum is 1, and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, the permutation is invalid, and the result is 0.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   ```python
   ans = 1
   kol = n
   for x in s:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = n - x
   ```
   This calculates the number of ways to choose elements for the suffix maximums using combinations. The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse, which is necessary for the combination formula.

5. **Combination Calculation for Prefix Maximums:**
   ```python
   kol = s[0] - 1
   p2 = []
   for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
       p2.append(p[i])
   for x in p2:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = x - 1
   ```
   This calculates the number of ways to choose elements for the prefix maximums using combinations, similar to the previous step.

6. **Permutations Between Maximums:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m1 - 1):
       ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   for i in range(m2 - 1):
       ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   ```
   This multiplies the number of permutations between the prefix and suffix maximums.

7. **Output the Result:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of `func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - `func_1` is used to compute the modular inverse, which is essential for the combination formula.
  - `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to compute the combination modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Overall Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly handles the combinatorial aspects of the problem.
  - It ensures that the prefix and suffix maximums are respected.
  - The use of precomputed factorials and modular inverses is appropriate for the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect. The provided program does indeed solve the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are part of a larger algorithm that correctly addresses the problem.

Final: **True**
