Based on the initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` is the length of `s` and does not change.
- `balance_info` is sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and for items with the same `balance`, by the `index` attribute in descending order. The final value of `balance` is 0.
- `result` is equal to `s`.

Given these conditions, the `print(result)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

Output: **s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence)**
