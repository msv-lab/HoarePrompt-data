### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to perform a balanced shuffle on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It returns the difference in balances if they are different.
     - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in positions in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).
     - This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be a helper function for sorting. However, it is not actually used in the sorting process in `func_2`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function takes a string `s` as input.
     - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It iterates through the string, computing the balance at each position and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
     - After computing all balances, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance and position (using the lambda function).
     - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The balance is correctly computed by incrementing for '(' and decrementing for ')'.
   - The sorting logic is correct: it sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - The construction of the result string from the sorted `balance_info` list is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with length up to 500,000) efficiently.
   - The sorting step ensures that the output is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

5. **Annotations and State Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly used to store the balance, position, and character.
   - The sorting logic in `func_2` matches the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
