Reasoning:

1. **Class Definition**: The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined to store the balance, position, and character information for each character in the input string.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It first compares the balances. If the balances are different, it returns the difference between the balances. If the balances are the same, it returns the difference between the positions in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first). This ensures that the sorting will be done first by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order when balances are the same.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function initializes the balance and creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to the list.
   - After the loop, the list of `BalanceInfo` objects is sorted using the key defined in `func_1`.
   - The sorted list is then used to construct the result string by concatenating the characters in the new order.
   - Finally, the result string is printed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly computes the balance for each prefix.
   - The sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the specified rules.
   - The final result is constructed by joining the characters in the sorted order, which should produce the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
