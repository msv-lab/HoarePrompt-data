Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers representing the digits of the last input provided by the user, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]` or `len(a)` (whichever is smaller). If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values, and `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains the same as it was initially.
- **`_`**: This variable is incremented with each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations, it will be `t - 1` because the loop starts from 0.
- **`a` and `b`**: These lists represent the digits of the last input provided by the user for the final test case.
- **`i`**: This variable holds the index where the digits of `a` and `b` differ, or it is equal to the length of `a` if all digits are the same.
- **`new` and `new2`**: These lists are constructed based on the comparison of `a` and `b`:
  - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` contains the maximum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` up to index `i-1`, and `None` for the rest. Similarly, `new2` contains the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` up to index `i-1`, and `None` for the rest.
  - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` contains the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for all indices, and `new2` contains the maximum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for all indices.
