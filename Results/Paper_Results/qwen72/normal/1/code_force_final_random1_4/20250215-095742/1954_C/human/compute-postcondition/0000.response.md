The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. Since `t` is already defined to be within the range 1 to 1000, we can assume that the input will be a valid integer within this range. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the input is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
