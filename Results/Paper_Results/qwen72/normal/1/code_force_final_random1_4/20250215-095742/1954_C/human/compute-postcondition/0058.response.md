Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the current index `i` is less than the length of the list `a` and the elements at index `i` in both `a` and `b` are equal.
- For each iteration, the loop updates the `new` list with the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and the `new2` list with the minimum value.
- The loop stops when it encounters the first index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, or when `i` reaches the length of `a`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be the index where the first difference occurs, or the length of `a` if no differences are found.
- The `new` list will contain the maximum values for all indices up to `i-1`, and the `new2` list will contain the minimum values for those same indices. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` will remain `None`.
