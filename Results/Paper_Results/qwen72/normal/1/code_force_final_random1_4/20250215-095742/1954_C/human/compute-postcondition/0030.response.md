Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, the value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, the value of `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, and the value of `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `new2[i]` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
