To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(a)`**
   - This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `a[i] == b[i]`**
   - This condition checks if the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b` are equal.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The length of `a` must be greater than 1.
- The elements `a[1]` and `b[1]` must be equal.

### Final State:
Given the conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(a) > 1` and `a[1] == b[1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input with `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user with `len(b) > 1`, `i` is 1, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, and `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.**
