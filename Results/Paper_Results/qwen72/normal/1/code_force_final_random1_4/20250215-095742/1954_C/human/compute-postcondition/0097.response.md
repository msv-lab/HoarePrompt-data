Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]` or `len(a)` (whichever is smaller), `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the current index `i` is less than the length of `a` and the elements at index `i` in both `a` and `b` are equal.
- For each iteration, the loop updates the `new` list with the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the `new2` list with the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- The loop stops when it finds the first index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, or when `i` reaches the length of `a` (whichever comes first).
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be the index where the loop stopped, and the lists `new` and `new2` will be updated up to that index with the maximum and minimum values, respectively, while the remaining elements will still be `None`.
