Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])` and the second element is `max(a[1], b[1])`, the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `min(a[1], b[1])`, and the rest are `None` values, `i` is 2, `a[0] == b[0]`, `len(a) > 2`, and `a[1] == b[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
