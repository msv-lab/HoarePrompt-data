Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines of input, each representing a large integer (with digits from 1 to 9). It then constructs two new lists of digits, `new` and `new2`, such that up to the first differing digit position, `new` contains the maximum digit and `new2` contains the minimum digit from the corresponding positions in the input lists. After the first differing digit, `new` continues with the minimum digit and `new2` with the maximum digit. Finally, it prints the two resulting lists as strings. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
