Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input with `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user with `len(b) > 1`, `i` is 3, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `a[1]` (or `b[1]` since `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`), the third element is `max(a[2], b[2])`, and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `min(a[1], b[1])`, the third element is `min(a[2], b[2])`, and the rest are `None` values, and `a[2]` must be equal to `b[2]`.**
