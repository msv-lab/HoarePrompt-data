Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list where `new[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a` except `new2[1]` which is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, and `a[2]` must be equal to `b[2]`.**
