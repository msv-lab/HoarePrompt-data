To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input.
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, then:
  - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
  - `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
- Otherwise, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged, and `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, it means `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.
   - Since the problem states that `i` is equal to `len(a)`, it implies that all elements in `a` and `b` are equal up to the length of `a`.

2. **Construct the `new` list:**
   - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are equal up to the length of `a`, `min(a[i], b[i])` will always be `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same).

3. **Convert `new` to a string:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `new` to a string and joins them together without any separator.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the digits of the list `a` (or `b` since they are the same) concatenated into a single string.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in a) (where a is the list of integers representing the digits of the input)**
