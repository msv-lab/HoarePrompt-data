To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user.
- `i` is the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]` or `len(a)` (whichever is smaller).
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values.
  - `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None` values.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is the first index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal up to the length of `a`.

2. **Construct `new`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, `new` will contain the maximum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to index `i-1`, and the rest will be `None`.
   - If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` will contain the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` for all indices from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new` into a single string, converting each element to a string. If an element is `None`, it will be represented as `'None'`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [1, 2, 4]`**
  - `i` is 2 (since `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`).
  - `new` will be `[max(1, 1), max(2, 2), None]` which is `[1, 2, None]`.
  - Output: **12None**

- **Scenario 2: `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [1, 2, 3]`**
  - `i` is 3 (since all elements are equal up to the length of `a`).
  - `new` will be `[min(1, 1), min(2, 2), min(3, 3)]` which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Output: **123**

### General Case:
- If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the output will be a string of the maximum values up to index `i-1` followed by `None` for the remaining elements.
- If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the output will be a string of the minimum values for all elements.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the output will be a string representation of the list `new` with elements converted to strings. If any element is `None`, it will be represented as `'None'`.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new) (where new is constructed based on the rules described above)**

For a more precise answer, you would need specific values for `a` and `b`. However, based on the general rules, the output will follow the pattern described.
