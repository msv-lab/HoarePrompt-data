Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is 0, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is 1, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, and `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input with `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user with `len(b) > 1`, `i` is 2, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `a[1]` (or `b[1]` since `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`), and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `min(a[1], b[1])`, and the rest are `None` values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input with `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user with `len(b) > 1`, `i` is 3, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `a[1]` (or `b[1]` since `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`), the third element is `max(a[2], b[2])`, and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `min(a[1], b[1])`, the third element is `min(a[2], b[2])`, and the rest are `None` values, and `a[2]` must be equal to `b[2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
