To determine what will be printed when the `print(x + y)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not used in the code).
   - `a` is an input integer (not used in the code).
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `x + y` is the sum of the number of times 'map' appears in `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The value of `x` is determined by counting the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
   - The value of `y` is determined by counting the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
   - The `print(x + y)` statement will output the sum of these two counts.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x + y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
