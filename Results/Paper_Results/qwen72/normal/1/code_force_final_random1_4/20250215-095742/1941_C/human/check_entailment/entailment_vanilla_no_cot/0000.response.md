Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings and does not actually calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mappie", the program would count "map" once and "pie" once, suggesting that two deletions are needed, but in reality, only one deletion (of 'p') is needed to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem correctly.
