Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = int(input())` updates the value of `a` to a new input integer. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
