Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in how the program determines the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Overcounting**: Counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" directly does not account for overlapping instances or the fact that removing one character can affect multiple substrings.
2. **Incorrect Deletion Logic**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". Simply counting the substrings does not provide the correct number of deletions needed.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
