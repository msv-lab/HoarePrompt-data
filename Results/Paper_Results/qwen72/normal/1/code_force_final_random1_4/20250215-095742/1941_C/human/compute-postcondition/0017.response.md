To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not used in the code).
   - `a` is an input integer (not used in the code).
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(x + y)` statement will print the sum of `x` and `y`.
   - `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
   - `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`.
   - However, the print statement will output the sum of the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `s`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
