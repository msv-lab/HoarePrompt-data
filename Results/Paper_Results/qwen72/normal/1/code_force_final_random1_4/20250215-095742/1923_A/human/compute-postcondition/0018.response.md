The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` reads a new input string, removes all spaces from it, and assigns the result to `arr`. This operation updates the value of `arr` but does not affect the other variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y`**.
