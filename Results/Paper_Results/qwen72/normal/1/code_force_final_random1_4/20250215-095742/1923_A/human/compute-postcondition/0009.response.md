Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from its previous value), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. All other variables (`t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged. The conditions and values associated with these variables are still valid as described in the initial state.
