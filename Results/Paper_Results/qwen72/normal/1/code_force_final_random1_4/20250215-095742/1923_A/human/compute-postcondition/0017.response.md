The code snippet `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` reads a new input string, removes all spaces from it, and assigns the result back to `arr`.

- `arr` is updated to the new input string with all spaces removed.
- `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is the new input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y`.**
