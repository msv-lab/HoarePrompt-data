To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is either 0 or 1.
- At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.

We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
