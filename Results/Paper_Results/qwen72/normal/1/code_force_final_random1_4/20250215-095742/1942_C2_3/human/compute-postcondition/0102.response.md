Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If the difference between the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between the last two elements of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus one, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.***
