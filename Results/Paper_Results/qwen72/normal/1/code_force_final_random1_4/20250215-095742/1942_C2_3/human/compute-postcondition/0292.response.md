Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least one element, `y` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + sum(odd) + 4 * 0 + 2 * 0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
