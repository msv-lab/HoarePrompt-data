Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
2. Each string in the list is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`.
3. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user input, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.**
