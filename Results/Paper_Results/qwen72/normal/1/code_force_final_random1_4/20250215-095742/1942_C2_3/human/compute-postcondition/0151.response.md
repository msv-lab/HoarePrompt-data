Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val` after the current `i`; `c` is the integer part of the new `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`; `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
