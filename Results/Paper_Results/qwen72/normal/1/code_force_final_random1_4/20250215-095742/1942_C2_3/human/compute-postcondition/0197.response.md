Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `st` remains unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` remains the next element in `even`, `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is 0.** 

Explanation:
- The code snippet `y = 0` sets the value of `y` to 0.
- All other variables (`x`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
