Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`, `tmp`, or `ans`.***
