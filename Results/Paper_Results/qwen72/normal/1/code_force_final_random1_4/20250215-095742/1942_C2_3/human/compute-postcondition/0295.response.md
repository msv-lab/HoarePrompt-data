Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least one element, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `y` is `y - gap // 2` (or 0 if `y < gap // 2` after the decrement).**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `x - 1`.
- The value of `next_elem` remains `a[0] + n`.
- The value of `gap` remains the next element in `even`.
- The list `odd` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- The list `even` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + gap`.
- The value of `y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2` after the decrement, `y` is set to 0.
