Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val`; `c` is the integer part of `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`. If `y < c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + (y - c) * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sx` is `sx + i`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sx` is incremented by `i`.
- The values of `val`, `i`, `c`, and `y` remain as described in the initial state.
- If `y < c`, `sx` is further updated to `sx + (y - c) * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `y >= c`, `sx` remains `sx + i` and no break occurs.
