Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least two elements; `i` is the next element in `val`; `c` is the integer part of `i` divided by 2; `y` is updated to `y - c`; `sx` is updated to `sx + (y - c) * 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.
- Since `y` was previously updated to `y - c`, the new value of `sx` becomes `sx + (y - c) * 2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
