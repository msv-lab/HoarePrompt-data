The code snippet appends a new value to the list `tmp`. This value is calculated as the integer division of the sum of the first element in `a` plus `n` minus the last element in `a` by 2.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `tmp` is a list that will store the results of the calculation.

The value being appended to `tmp` is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list `a`.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in the list `a`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of the smallest element in `a`, `n`, and the negation of the largest element in `a`.

After appending this value to `tmp`, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `tmp` now contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and the sum of the smallest element in `a` and `n` minus the largest element in `a` is not equal to 2. Additionally, the sum of the smallest element in `a` and `n` minus the largest element in `a` is even, and `y` is greater than the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
