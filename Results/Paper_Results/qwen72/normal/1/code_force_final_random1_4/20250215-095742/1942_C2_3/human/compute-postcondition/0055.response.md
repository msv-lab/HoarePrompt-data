The code appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial conditions, let's break down the changes:

- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to the second element in the list, and `a[i - 1]` refers to the first element in the list.
- The difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, so `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is an integer.
- `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.

After executing the code, the list `tmp` will contain one element, which is the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is even, and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
