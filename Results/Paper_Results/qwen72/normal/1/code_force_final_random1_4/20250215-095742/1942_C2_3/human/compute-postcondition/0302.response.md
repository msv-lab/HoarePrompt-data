Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least two elements, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `y` is `0 - (gap // 2)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
