Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `y` to 0. This changes the value of `y` from its previous state, which was used to increase `ans` by `2 * y`. All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The new value of `y` is now 0, and this is reflected in the output state.
