Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `st` remains unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` remains the next element in `even`, `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`**. 

The value of `y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `y` was less than `gap // 2` before the operation, `y` would become negative or zero. If `y` was greater than or equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is simply reduced by `gap // 2`.
