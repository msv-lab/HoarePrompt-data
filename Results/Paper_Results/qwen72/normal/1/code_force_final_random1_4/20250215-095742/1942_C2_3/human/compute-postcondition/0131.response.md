Functionality: ** The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. For each set, it calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and the value of `y`. The function then prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. After processing all sets, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the number of test cases processed (`tt`), the last set of inputs (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the sorted list `a`), and the computed value `ans` for the last set. **
