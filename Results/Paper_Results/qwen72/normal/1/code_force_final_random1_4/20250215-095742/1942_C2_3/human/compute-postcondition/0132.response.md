The code snippet `val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))` sorts the list `val` based on a custom key. The key function `(1 - x & 1, x)` first evaluates the expression `1 - x & 1` to determine the primary sorting criterion, and then uses `x` itself as the secondary criterion.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Primary Sorting Criterion**: `1 - x & 1`
   - `x & 1` checks if `x` is odd (resulting in 1) or even (resulting in 0).
   - `1 - x & 1` will be 0 for odd numbers and 1 for even numbers.
   - This means odd numbers will come before even numbers in the sorted list.

2. **Secondary Sorting Criterion**: `x`
   - Within the groups of odd and even numbers, the numbers are sorted in ascending order.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`val`**: The list `val` is sorted according to the criteria described above.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `x`, `i`, `c`, `sx`, `n`, `t`, `y`, `cons`, and `l` remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order. `x` is the final value of `x` from the initial state, `i` is `x`, `c` is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`, `val` contains `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, and `sx` is the sum of 1 for each `c` that equals 1 in `val`. The values of `n`, `t`, `y`, `cons`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.**
