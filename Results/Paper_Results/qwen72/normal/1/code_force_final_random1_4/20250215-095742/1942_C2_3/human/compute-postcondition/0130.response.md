The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears to accept the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x`: An integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y`: An integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- A list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Given these parameters, the function processes the input and returns a result based on the provided constraints. However, the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, so I will describe the functionality based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `x`, an integer `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided constraints.**
