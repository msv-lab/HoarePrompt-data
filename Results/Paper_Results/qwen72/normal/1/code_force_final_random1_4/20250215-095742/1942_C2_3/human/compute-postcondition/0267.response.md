The value of `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. The other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is increased by `2 * y`**.
