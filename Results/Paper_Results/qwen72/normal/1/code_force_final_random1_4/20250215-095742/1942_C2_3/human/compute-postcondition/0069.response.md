Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.
- The value of `i` is 3, so `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`.
- The difference `a[3] - a[2]` is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`), and the result is appended to `tmp`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
