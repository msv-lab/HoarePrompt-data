Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `i` is `x - 1` otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap` appended to it. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. If `gap` is not greater than 1 or is not odd, `odd` remains unchanged. If `gap` is not greater than 0 or is not even, `even` remains unchanged.***
