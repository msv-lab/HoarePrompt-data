Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game's logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the MEX of the array directly, which does not align with the game's rules where Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from the array.

A correct implementation would need to simulate the game's turns, ensuring that Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, respectively. The current implementation does not do this, and thus fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the optimal play would result in a final array `c` with a MEX of `1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
