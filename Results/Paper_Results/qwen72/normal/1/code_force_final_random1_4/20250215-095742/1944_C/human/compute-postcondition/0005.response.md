The value of `nums[start]` is decremented by 1. Since `start` is 0, the count of the integer at index 0 in `arr` (which is `arr[0]`) in the `Counter` object `nums` is reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1. `start` is 0. `vis` is a set containing the element 0.**
