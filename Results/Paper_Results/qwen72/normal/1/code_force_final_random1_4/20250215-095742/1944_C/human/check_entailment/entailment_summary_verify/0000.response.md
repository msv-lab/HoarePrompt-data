### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice and Bob take turns.
  - Alice appends an element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
  - Bob removes an element from `a`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Input**: A list of integers `arr`.
- **Process**:
  - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
  - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of processed integers.
  - It enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value exists in the `Counter`:
    - If it does, it adds `start` to `vis` and decrements its count in the `Counter`.
    - If `start + 1` also exists in the `Counter`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
    - If `start + 1` does not exist, it prints `start + 1` and returns.
  - If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, it prints `start`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Simulation of Turns**: The function does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it attempts to find the MEX directly by processing the elements in a specific order.
- **Optimal Play**: The function does not consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It simply processes the elements in a linear manner, which does not align with the game's rules.
- **Test Case Analysis**:
  - **Input**: `1 4 0 1 2 3`
  - **Expected Output**: `1`
  - **Actual Output**: The function will output `2`, which is incorrect.

The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's logic and does not ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
