You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list arr.
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: The final state after all iterations of the loop is as follows: `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `nums` is a Counter object where the counts of the integers visited by `start` are decremented appropriately based on the loop's operations. Specifically, the count of each integer from 0 up to the last visited integer (inclusive) will be decremented by 1, and the count of the next integer (if it exists and was decremented) will also be decremented by 1. `start` will be the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, which means `nums[start]` is 0 or `nums[start + 1]` is 0. `vis` will contain all the integers that were visited by `start` during the loop's execution.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start (where start is the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, and nums[start] is 0 or nums[start + 1] is 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is within the range from 0 to the length of the list minus one, and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.

Case_3: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
