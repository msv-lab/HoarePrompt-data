Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 1, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1. The count of `1` in `nums` must be greater than 0. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, then `nums` has the count of 2 decreased by 1, `start` is updated to 2, and `vis` remains unchanged. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, the program does not return any value and the state remains as described in the precondition.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 1) to the set `vis`.
- Initially, `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.
- After adding `start` (which is 1), `vis` now contains the elements 0, 1, and 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
