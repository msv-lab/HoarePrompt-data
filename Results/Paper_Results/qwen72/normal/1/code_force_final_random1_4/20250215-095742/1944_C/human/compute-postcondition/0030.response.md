To determine what will be printed by the `print(start)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

### Initial State:
- `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the integers visited by `start` are decremented appropriately based on the loop's operations.
  - Specifically, the count of each integer from 0 up to the last visited integer (inclusive) will be decremented by 1.
  - The count of the next integer (if it exists and was decremented) will also be decremented by 1.
- `start` will be the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, which means:
  - `nums[start]` is 0 or `nums[start + 1]` is 0.
- `vis` will contain all the integers that were visited by `start` during the loop's execution.

### Analysis:
- The `start` variable is the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop.
- This means that `start` is the last integer in the sequence of integers visited by the loop where the count in `nums` was decremented to 0 or the count of the next integer (`start + 1`) was decremented to 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, `start` will be the last integer that was processed by the loop, and it will be the value that is printed.

### Output:
Output: **start (where start is the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, and nums[start] is 0 or nums[start + 1] is 0)**
