Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 1, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. The count of `1` in `nums` is now greater than or equal to -1.**
