The code snippet `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the count of the integer `start + 1` in the `Counter` object `nums` by 1. Given that `start` is 1, this means the count of the integer `2` in `nums` is decremented by 1.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 1, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1.
   - `start` is 1.
   - `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1.
   - The count of `1` in `nums` is now greater than or equal to -1.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The count of the integer `2` in `nums` is decremented by 1.

3. **Updated State**:
   - The count of `2` in `nums` is now one less than its previous value.
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 1, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1. The count of `2` in `nums` is now one less than its previous value. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. The count of `1` in `nums` is now greater than or equal to -1.**
