Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the following adjustments:
  - The count of `arr[0]` is decreased by 1.
  - The count of `1` is decreased by 2.
  - The count of `start` (which is 1) is further decreased by 1.
- `start` is 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1 (note that sets do not allow duplicate elements, so `vis` effectively contains {0, 1}).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `start` is explicitly given as 1.
- The expression `start + 1` will evaluate to `1 + 1`, which is 2.

### Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `start + 1`, which is 2.
Output: **2**
