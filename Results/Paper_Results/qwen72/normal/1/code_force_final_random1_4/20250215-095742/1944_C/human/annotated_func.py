#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list arr.
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: The final state after all iterations of the loop is as follows: `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `nums` is a Counter object where the counts of the integers visited by `start` are decremented appropriately based on the loop's operations. Specifically, the count of each integer from 0 up to the last visited integer (inclusive) will be decremented by 1, and the count of the next integer (if it exists and was decremented) will also be decremented by 1. `start` will be the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, which means `nums[start]` is 0 or `nums[start + 1]` is 0. `vis` will contain all the integers that were visited by `start` during the loop's execution.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start (where start is the last integer that was successfully processed by the loop, and nums[start] is 0 or nums[start + 1] is 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr`, where each integer is within the range from 0 to the length of the list minus one. It processes the list to track and decrement the occurrences of certain integers based on a specific pattern. The function does not modify the original list `arr`. Instead, it uses a `Counter` object to keep track of the counts of integers in `arr` and a set `vis` to record the integers that have been processed. The function prints the last integer that was successfully processed and then terminates without returning any value.
