### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which she builds), and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a counter to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and iterates through the elements, simulating the game.
   - If the current `start` value is present in the array, it is added to a set `vis` and its count is decremented.
   - If the next value (`start + 1`) is also present, it is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
   - The process continues until a value is found that is not in the array, at which point `start + 1` is printed as the MEX.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly simulates the game by ensuring that Alice and Bob make optimal moves.
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible value in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible value by removing it if possible.
   - The use of a counter and a set ensures that the simulation is efficient and correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases such as when the array is empty or contains only one element.
   - The solution also handles cases where the array contains repeated elements.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The output matches the expected results for the given test cases:
     - For `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, the MEX is 2.
     - For `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, the MEX is 1.
     - For `arr = [1, 1]`, the MEX is 0.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the state of the program is correctly managed:
     - `nums` is a `Counter` object that tracks the frequency of each element in `arr`.
     - `start` is initialized to 0 and is used to simulate the game.
     - The loop continues until `start` reaches a value that is not in `nums` or `start + 1` is not in `nums`.
     - The final state of the program is consistent with the expected behavior of the game.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the game logic and produces the correct MEX values for the given test cases. The annotated code further validates the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
