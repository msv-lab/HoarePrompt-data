To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as this indicates that there are elements in the string `s` to iterate over.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `balance_info` is an empty list.
- `balance` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 (the default starting point for `range(n)`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is an empty list; `balance` is 0; `i` is 0**
