Reasoning:  
- The program correctly defines a class `BalanceInfo` to store the balance, position, and character information for each character in the input string.
- `func_1` is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for sorting.
- `func_2` processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, where each object represents a character in the string along with its balance and position.
- The list of `BalanceInfo` objects is then sorted using the custom comparator defined in `func_1`, which sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
- Finally, the sorted list is used to construct the shuffled string, which is printed as the output.

The implementation of the functions and the logic used to solve the problem are consistent with the problem description and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
