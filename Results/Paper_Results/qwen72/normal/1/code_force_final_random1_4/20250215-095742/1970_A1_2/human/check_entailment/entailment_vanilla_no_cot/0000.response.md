Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be a placeholder for a comparison function. However, it is not necessary for the solution to work, as the sorting is handled by the lambda function in `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Balance Calculation**: The function iterates through the input string `s`, maintaining a running balance of the parentheses. It appends a `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list for each character, storing the current balance, position, and character.
   - **Sorting**: The `balance_info` list is sorted based on the balance and, in case of ties, by the position in descending order. This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle.
   - **Result Construction**: After sorting, the characters are concatenated to form the result string, which is then printed.

The program correctly handles the input constraints and produces the expected output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct.
