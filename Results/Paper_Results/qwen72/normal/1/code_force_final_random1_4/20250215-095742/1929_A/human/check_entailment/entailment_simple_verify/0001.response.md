Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of this sum.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we need to consider the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal way to achieve this is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the array ensures that the elements are in ascending order.
   - **Difference Calculation**: The program calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. However, this does not correctly compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct approach is to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This can be done by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty is calculated as \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For the input `[69, 69, 69]`, the sorted array is `[69, 69, 69]`. The beauty is calculated as \( (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).
   - For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the sorted array is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is calculated as \( (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \).

Given the above reasoning, the original program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Final: **False**
