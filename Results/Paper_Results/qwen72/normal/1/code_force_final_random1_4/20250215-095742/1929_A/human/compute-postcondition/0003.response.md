The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `ntest` must be greater than 0
- `itest` is 0

After executing the code, the list `a` is updated with the new input values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**
