Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). However, this approach does not consider the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, which is required to calculate the maximum beauty.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2` because the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]` has a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program will output `2` because it only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is `3 - 1 = 2`.

While the output is correct in this specific case, the program's logic is flawed and will fail for other inputs. For example:

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1` because the sorted array `[3, 3, 3, 4]` has a beauty of `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`. However, the program will output `1` because it only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is `4 - 3 = 1`.

This approach fails to correctly compute the sum of differences for all pairs of adjacent elements, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
