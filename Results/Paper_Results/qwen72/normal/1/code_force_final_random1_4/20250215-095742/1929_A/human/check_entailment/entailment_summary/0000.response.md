Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, this approach does not correctly compute the "beauty" of the array as defined in the problem statement. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. 

To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of these differences.

The current implementation only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not equivalent to the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
