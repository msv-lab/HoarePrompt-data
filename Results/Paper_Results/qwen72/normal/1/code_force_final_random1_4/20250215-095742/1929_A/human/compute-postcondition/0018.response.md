Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list of integers and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the sorted list. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the processed test cases, with the final value of `ntest` (the number of test cases) remaining unchanged, and `itest` being equal to `ntest - 1`. **
