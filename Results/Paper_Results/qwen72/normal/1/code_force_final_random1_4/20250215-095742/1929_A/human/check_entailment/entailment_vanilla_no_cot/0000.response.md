Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given solution does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum. However, the provided solution only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which is not the same as the required sum of differences.

To solve the problem correctly, one should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This version sorts the array and computes the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which matches the definition of the array's beauty.
