Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the program simply sorts the array and outputs the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as maximizing the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty of the array, we should sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting in descending order ensures that the positive differences are maximized, leading to the highest possible beauty.

Here's the correct approach:

1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        
        print(beauty)
```

Given the original program, the correctness is **False** because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
