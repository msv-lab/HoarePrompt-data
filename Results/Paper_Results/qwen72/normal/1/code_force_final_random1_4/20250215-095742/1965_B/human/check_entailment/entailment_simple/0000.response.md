### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, `t`. This function correctly reads an integer from standard input, which is appropriate for the problem statement.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, `func_14()` is called to generate the required sequence. The function `func_14()` reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which correctly parses a line of space-separated integers.

3. **Sequence Generation**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = 1 \)**:
     - If \( n = 2 \), the function returns the string `'1\n2'`, which is a valid sequence for this specific case.
     - For \( n > 2 \), the function constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to \( 2^{l-1} \), where \( l \) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \( n \). This ensures that all sums from 1 to \( n \) except \( k = 1 \) can be formed.
   - **Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)**:
     - The function constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to \( 2^{lk-2} \), where \( lk \) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \( k \).
     - It then appends \( k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans) \) to ensure the sum \( k \) cannot be formed.
     - It also appends \( k + 1 \) and \( 2k + 1 \) to cover additional values.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from \( 2^{lk-2} \) to \( 2^{l-1} \) to ensure all other sums from 1 to \( n \) can be formed.

4. **Output**: The function `func_14()` returns a space-separated string of the generated sequence, which is then written to standard output by `func_15()`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes each test case according to the problem requirements, and generates the required sequence. The logic for constructing the sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) while allowing all other sums from 1 to \( n \) to be formed.

**Correctness: True**
