To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is \(lk - 1\)
   - `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `i` is in the range from `lk` to `l` (exclusive).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `l`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes \(lk\).
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values \([1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^{(lk-2)}, 2^{(lk-1)}]\), `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is \(lk\), `lk` must be less than `l`**.
