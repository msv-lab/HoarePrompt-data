Functionality: ** The function `func_14` takes no explicit parameters but implicitly depends on two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It returns a string. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k` and returns a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` starts with [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from 2^2 up to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` contains a sequence starting with the powers of 2 from 1 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^(lk-2) up to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be less than `l`. **
