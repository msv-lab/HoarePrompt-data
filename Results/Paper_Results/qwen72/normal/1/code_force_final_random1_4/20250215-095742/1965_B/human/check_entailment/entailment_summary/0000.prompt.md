Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Reads a single integer from standard input and returns this integer value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has read one line of input and converted it to an integer, which is then returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated values from standard input and returns a map object where each value from the input is converted to an integer. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function call, the caller will receive a map object that can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a list of integers. The function does not take any arguments. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the input, and the state of the program reflects the successful conversion and storage of these integers in a list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list of length `rows_number`, where each element in the list is the result of calling `func_3()`. The function generates a list with the specified number of elements, each of which is the output of `func_3()`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` reads the next line of input from standard input (stdin), removes any trailing whitespace, decodes the input from bytes to a string, and returns this processed string. It does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the returned value is the next line of input from stdin, processed as described.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a list of integers derived from the user's input.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times. Each element in the returned list is the result of one call to `func_7()`. If `rows` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It reads user input and returns it as a string. After the function concludes, the program has obtained a string input from the user.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` reads an integer value from the user and returns this integer value. It does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has returned the integer value entered by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into substrings based on whitespace, and returns these substrings as a list of strings. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of strings derived from the user's input.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d` (a dictionary with integer keys and lists of integers as values), `processing` (a list of integers initialized to 0), `da` (an integer key present in `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers of the same length as `processing`). The function updates the `rank` list and returns an integer value. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`), updating the `rank` list and returning the minimum value obtained from these recursive calls plus 1. After the function completes, the `rank[da - 1]` is set to this minimum value plus 1.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, a calculated value based on the results of the recursive call, and the third element from the recursive call. The purpose of the function is to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact relationship is not specified in the annotations.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes no explicit parameters but implicitly depends on two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It returns a string. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k` and returns a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, `ans` starts with [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from 2^2 up to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` contains a sequence starting with the powers of 2 from 1 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^(lk-2) up to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be less than `l`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. In each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. After the function completes, the standard output will contain the results of `func_14()` printed the same number of times as the value returned by `func_10()`.
