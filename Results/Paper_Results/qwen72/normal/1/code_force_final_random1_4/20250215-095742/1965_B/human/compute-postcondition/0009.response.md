Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and must be greater than 2, `k` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 4], `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `2 ** i` evaluates to `4`. Therefore, `ans` changes from `[2, 3]` to `[2, 3, 4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
