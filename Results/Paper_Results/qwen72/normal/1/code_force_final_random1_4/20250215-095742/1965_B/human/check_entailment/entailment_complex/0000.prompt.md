Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a list of integers derived from the user's input.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: rows is a non-negative integer.
def func_8(rows):

    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times, where `rows` is a non-negative integer. Each element in the list is the result of one call to `func_7()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times. Each element in the returned list is the result of one call to `func_7()`. If `rows` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0. The value of `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d` (a dictionary with integer keys and lists of integers as values), `processing` (a list of integers initialized to 0), `da` (an integer key present in `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers of the same length as `processing`). The function updates the `rank` list and returns an integer value. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`), updating the `rank` list and returning the minimum value obtained from these recursive calls plus 1. After the function completes, the `rank[da - 1]` is set to this minimum value plus 1.

#Function 13:

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: the second element (`y`) from the tuple returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, the result of the expression `x - a // b * y` where `x` is the first element from the tuple returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`, and the third element (`g`) from the tuple returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero) and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, a calculated value based on the results of the recursive call, and the third element from the recursive call. The purpose of the function is to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact relationship is not specified in the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. In each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character.
