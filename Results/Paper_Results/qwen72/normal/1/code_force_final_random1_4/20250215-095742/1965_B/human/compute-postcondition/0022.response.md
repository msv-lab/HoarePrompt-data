Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2], `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1**. 

The code appends the value `2 ** i` (which is 2) to the list `ans`. The list `ans` initially contained the value 1, and now it contains the values [1, 2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
