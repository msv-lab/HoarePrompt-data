Postcondition: ***After the loop has executed all iterations, `s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is the total number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different. If `flag` is True, indicating there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`, then `count` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `flag` remains False.***
