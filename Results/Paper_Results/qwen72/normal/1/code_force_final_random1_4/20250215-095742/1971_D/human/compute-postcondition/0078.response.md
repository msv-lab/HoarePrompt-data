Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `count` is 3. If `s[j]` (which is `s[1]`) is not equal to `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[2]`), then `count` is incremented to 3. If `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
