Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If the first character of `s` (`s[0]`) is not equal to the second character of `s` (`s[1]`), then `count` is 2. If `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
