### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case, reading the string `s`.

2. **Set Creation and Length Check**: 
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s` to identify unique characters.
   - It checks if the length of the set `a` is 2. If so, it prints "NO" because if there are exactly two unique characters, any rearrangement will still result in a string that is either the same as `s` or its reverse, which is not allowed.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The program sorts the string `s` to get `b` and sorts it in reverse order to get `c`.
   - It then checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the reversed string `c` to ensure the output is different from `s`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b` as the rearranged string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with more than two unique characters, the program ensures that the output is different from the input by sorting or reversing the string.
   - For strings with exactly two unique characters, the program correctly identifies that no valid rearrangement exists and prints "NO".

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program follows the required output format by printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the rearranged string when applicable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
