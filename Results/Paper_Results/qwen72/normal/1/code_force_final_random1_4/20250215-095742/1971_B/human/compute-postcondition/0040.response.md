Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `n` strings `s` of lowercase English letters, each of length at most 10. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by either the string sorted in descending order (if the original string was already sorted in ascending order) or the string sorted in ascending order. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to process the input and print the results. **
