You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` was an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each `s`, `a` was a set containing the unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contained exactly 2 unique characters, and 'NO' was printed. Otherwise, `a` contained a number of unique characters not equal to 2, `b` was a sorted string of `s`, and `c` was a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of `s`) was equal to `s`, then `s` was already sorted in ascending order, and `c` was printed. Otherwise, `b` was printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if len(a) == 2:` is too restrictive. It incorrectly assumes that if there are exactly two distinct characters in the string, it is impossible to rearrange the string to meet the requirements. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the string "abab". This string has exactly two distinct characters, but it can be rearranged to "baba", which is different from the original string. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for such cases when it should output "YES" and provide a valid rearrangement.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the string has only one distinct character (e.g., "aaaaa") correctly. It should output "NO" for such cases, but the current logic does not explicitly check for this scenario.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Case with exactly two distinct characters**: The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for strings like "abab".
2. **Case with a single distinct character**: The program does not explicitly handle strings like "aaaaa" and may output "NO" incorrectly.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Check if the string has only one distinct character and output "NO" in that case.
- For strings with more than one distinct character, attempt to generate a valid rearrangement that is different from the original string.
