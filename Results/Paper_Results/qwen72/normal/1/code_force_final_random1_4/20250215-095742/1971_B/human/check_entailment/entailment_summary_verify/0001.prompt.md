You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `n` strings `s` of lowercase English letters, each of length at most 10. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by either the string sorted in descending order (if the original string was already sorted in ascending order) or the string sorted in ascending order. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to process the input and print the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case, reading the string `s`.

2. **Set Creation and Length Check**: 
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s` to identify unique characters.
   - It checks if the length of the set `a` is 2. If so, it prints "NO" because if there are exactly two unique characters, any rearrangement will still result in a string that is either the same as `s` or its reverse, which is not allowed.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The program sorts the string `s` to get `b` and sorts it in reverse order to get `c`.
   - It then checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the reversed string `c` to ensure the output is different from `s`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b` as the rearranged string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with more than two unique characters, the program ensures that the output is different from the input by sorting or reversing the string.
   - For strings with exactly two unique characters, the program correctly identifies that no valid rearrangement exists and prints "NO".

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program follows the required output format by printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the rearranged string when applicable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
