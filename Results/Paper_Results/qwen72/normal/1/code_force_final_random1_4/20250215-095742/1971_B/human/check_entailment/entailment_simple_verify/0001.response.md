### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case, reading the string `s`.

2. **Set Creation and Length Check**:
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s` to identify unique characters.
   - It checks if the length of the set `a` is 2. If so, it prints "NO" because if there are exactly two unique characters, any rearrangement will still result in a string that is either the same as `s` or its reverse, which is not allowed.
   - However, this check is not entirely correct. Consider the string "abab". This string has exactly two unique characters ('a' and 'b'), but it can be rearranged to "baba" which is different from "abab". Therefore, the condition `if len(a) == 2` should be reconsidered.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The program sorts the string `s` to get `b` and sorts it in reverse order to get `c`.
   - It then checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the reversed string `c` to ensure the output is different from `s`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b` as the rearranged string.
   - This logic is generally correct, but it fails to handle the case where `s` is already sorted in reverse order. In such a case, both `b` and `c` will be the same, and the program will incorrectly print `c`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with more than two unique characters, the program ensures that the output is different from the input by sorting or reversing the string.
   - For strings with exactly two unique characters, the program incorrectly identifies that no valid rearrangement exists in some cases (e.g., "abab").

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program follows the required output format by printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the rearranged string when applicable.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all the specified conditions and edge cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle strings with exactly two unique characters that can be rearranged differently, and it may incorrectly print the same string when `s` is already sorted in reverse order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
