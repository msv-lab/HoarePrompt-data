To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`.
     - If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters.
     - Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2.
   - `b` is a sorted string of the new `s`.
   - `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order.
   - If `b` (the sorted version of the new `s`) is equal to the new `s`, then the new `s` is already sorted in ascending order.
   - Otherwise, `b` is not equal to the new `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print('YES')` statement.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement will always be:

Output: **YES**
