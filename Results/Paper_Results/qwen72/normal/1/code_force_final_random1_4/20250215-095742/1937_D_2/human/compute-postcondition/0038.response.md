Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<'. If the length of `idx_B` is 0, `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is not empty.***
