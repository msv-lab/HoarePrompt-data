Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` now includes the value 1 appended to it, and if `len(idx_A) == 0`, `A` is updated to include an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `A` is updated with `x` appended to it.**
