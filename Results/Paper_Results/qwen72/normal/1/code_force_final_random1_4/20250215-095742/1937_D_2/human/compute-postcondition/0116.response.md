Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than `r`. If `r` is 0, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.***
