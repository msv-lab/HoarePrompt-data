Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the string `s`). The lists `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`. For each position `i` where `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` will store the index `i`, and `A` will store the calculated value `x` as defined in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.**
