Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is not empty, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation:
- `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
- Since `B` is an empty list, `len(B)` is 0, so `B[len(B) - 1]` would raise an IndexError. However, since the problem states that `idx_B` is not empty, we assume that `B` is also not empty for the calculation to be valid.
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and `j` is 0, so `i` is `n - 1`.
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` refers to the last element in `idx_B`.
- `len(idx_B)` is the length of `idx_B`.
- Therefore, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
