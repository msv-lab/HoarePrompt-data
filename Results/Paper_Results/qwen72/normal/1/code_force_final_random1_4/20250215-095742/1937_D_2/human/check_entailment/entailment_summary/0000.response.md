Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicators ('<' or '>') at each cell. The program processes multiple test cases, each with a different grid configuration. The core logic is encapsulated in the `func_1` function, which calculates the time for the pinball to exit the grid for each starting position.

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid configuration `s`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, along with their respective index lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
   - `A` and `idx_A` track the cumulative effect of '>' characters from left to right.
   - `B` and `idx_B` track the cumulative effect of '<' characters from right to left.

3. **Calculating Exit Times:**
   - The program iterates through each cell in the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '<' or '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to exit the grid using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative effects based on the current position and the number of relevant characters seen so far.

4. **Output:**
   - The results are printed directly for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The program correctly preprocesses the grid to compute the cumulative effects of '<' and '>' characters.
  - The main loop correctly handles the different scenarios for both '<' and '>' characters, ensuring that the pinball's movement and the time to exit are accurately calculated.
  - The use of cumulative sums and adjustments ensures that the program efficiently computes the required times without reprocessing the entire grid for each query.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as grids with only '<' or only '>' characters.
  - It also correctly handles the transition between different segments of the grid where the direction changes.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The preprocessing step runs in O(n) time, and the main loop also runs in O(n) time, making the overall complexity O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input and produces the expected output format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
