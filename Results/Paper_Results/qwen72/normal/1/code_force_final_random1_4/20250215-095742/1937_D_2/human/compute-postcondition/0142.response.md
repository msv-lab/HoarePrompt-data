The value of `a` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to its current value. Given that `i` is 1 and `a` is initially the value of `A[l - 1]`, the new value of `a` becomes `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**
