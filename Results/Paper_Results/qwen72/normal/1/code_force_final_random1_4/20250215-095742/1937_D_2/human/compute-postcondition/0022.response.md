To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `x` is calculated using the formula: `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
   - `A[len(A) - 1]` refers to the last element of list `A`.
   - `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` refers to the last element of list `idx_A`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `len(idx_A)` is the length of list `idx_A`.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - Let's denote the last element of `A` as `A_last`.
   - Let's denote the last element of `idx_A` as `idx_A_last`.
   - The formula becomes: `x = A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.

5. **Output State:**
   - `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` remains greater than 2.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.
   - `x` is now equal to `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged, `x` is equal to `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.**
