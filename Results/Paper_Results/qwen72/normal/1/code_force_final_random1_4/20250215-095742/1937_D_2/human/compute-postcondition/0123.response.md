The value of `b` is updated to `b - B[x]`. The value of `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, so `b` is now the element at index `r - 1` of list `B` minus the element at index `r - (l + 2)` of list `B`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the element at index `r - 1` of list `B` minus the element at index `r - (l + 2)` of list `B`.**
