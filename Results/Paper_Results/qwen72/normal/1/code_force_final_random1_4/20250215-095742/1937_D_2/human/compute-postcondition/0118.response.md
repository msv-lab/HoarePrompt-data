Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If the first character of `s` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, and `b` is updated to `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`. In all cases where the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is 0, no further changes occur. If `l` is not 0, `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the element at index `r` of `B` plus `(idx_B[r] - 0) * l`. If `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is 0, no further changes occur. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.***
