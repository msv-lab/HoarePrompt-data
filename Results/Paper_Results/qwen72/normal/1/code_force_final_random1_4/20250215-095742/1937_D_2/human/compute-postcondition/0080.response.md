Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`, and the difference between `l` and `r` is greater than 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` (which is `A[l - 1]`) minus the value of `A[l - r - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
