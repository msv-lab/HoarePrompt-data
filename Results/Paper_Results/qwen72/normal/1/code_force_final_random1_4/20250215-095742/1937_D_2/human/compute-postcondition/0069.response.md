The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `b` was initially defined as `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`.
- The new value of `b` is calculated as `b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is:
\[ b = B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) \times (x + 1) \]

All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**
