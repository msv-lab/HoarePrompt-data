Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is assigned the value of `B[r]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `b`. Since `r` was previously decreased by 1, `b` now holds the value of the element in `B` at the index `r` (which is one less than its original value). All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
