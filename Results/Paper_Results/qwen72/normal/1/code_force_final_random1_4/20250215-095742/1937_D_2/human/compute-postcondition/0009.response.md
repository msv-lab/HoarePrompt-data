Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list containing one element which is `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is not an empty list, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>'**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- Since `i` is 0, `x` becomes `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- This value of `x` is appended to the list `A`, which was initially empty.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
