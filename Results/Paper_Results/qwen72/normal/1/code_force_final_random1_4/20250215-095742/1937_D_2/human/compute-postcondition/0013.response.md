To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If `s[0]` is '>', then:
  - If `idx_A` was initially empty, `idx_A` is now `[0]`.
  - If `idx_A` was not initially empty, `idx_A` now contains one more element, which is `0`.
  - If `idx_A` was initially empty, `A` is now `[0]` and `idx_A` remains an empty list.
  - If `idx_A` was not initially empty, `A` is now `[(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)]` and `idx_A` is not an empty list.
- If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- The states of `A` and `idx_A` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, as they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.**
