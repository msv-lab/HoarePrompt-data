Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>'. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element which is `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `idx_A` is not an empty list.***
