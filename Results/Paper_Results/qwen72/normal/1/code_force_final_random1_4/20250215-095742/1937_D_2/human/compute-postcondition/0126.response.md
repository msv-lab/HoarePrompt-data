Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
