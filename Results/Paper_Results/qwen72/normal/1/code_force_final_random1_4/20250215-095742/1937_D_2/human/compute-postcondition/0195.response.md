Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r-1]`, `b` is `A[l-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `r` is still decreased by 1.
- The value of `a` is still `B[r-1]`.
- A new variable `b` is introduced and assigned the value of `A[l-1]`. The value of `l` is not specified, but `b` is now equal to `A[l-1]`.
