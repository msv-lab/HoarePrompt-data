Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, no further changes occur. If `l` is greater than 0 and `l <= r`, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`. If `l` is greater than 0 and `l > r`, `a` is set to the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `r` was initially 0, no further changes occur.***
