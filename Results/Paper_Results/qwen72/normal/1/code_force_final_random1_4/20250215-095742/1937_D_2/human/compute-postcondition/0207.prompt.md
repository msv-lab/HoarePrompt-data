You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

The list `idx_A` will contain the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty lists.

    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`. If the last character of `s` is '>', `l` is the total number of '>' characters in `s`, and `r` is 0. If the last character of `s` is '<', `l` is the total number of '>' characters in `s`, and `r` is the total number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1. The values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged from their initial states, reflecting the cumulative counts and indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the string balanced, where all '<' characters appear before any '>' characters.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
