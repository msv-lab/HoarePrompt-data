To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `i` was initially `n - 2`
- `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`
- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- If `s[i] == '<'`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]`
- If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list
- Otherwise, `B` is a list containing `x`, `idx_B` is an empty list, and an error occurs because `B` and `idx_B` are empty lists, making `len(B) - 1` and `len(idx_B) - 1` invalid indices

### Code Snippet:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the state of `B` and `idx_B`:**
   - If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list.
   - Otherwise, `B` is a list containing `x`, and `idx_B` is an empty list, which leads to an error.

2. **Evaluate the conditions:**
   - Since `idx_B` is an empty list, `len(idx_B) == 0`.
   - Therefore, `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list.

3. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `B` is `[0]`, so `len(B) - 1` is `0`.
   - `idx_B` is an empty list, so `len(idx_B)` is `0`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.

4. **Substitute the values into the expression:**
   - `x = B[0] + (idx_B[0] - i) * len(idx_B)`
   - `x = 0 + (0 - (n - 3)) * 0`
   - `x = 0 + 0`
   - `x = 0`

### Output State:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `i` was initially `n - 2`
- `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`
- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `B` is `[0]`
- `idx_B` is an empty list
- `x` is `0`

Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `i` was initially `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `B` is `[0]`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `x` is `0`.**
