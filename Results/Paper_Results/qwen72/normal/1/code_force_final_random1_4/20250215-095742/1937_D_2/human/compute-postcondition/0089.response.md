The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', these conditions still hold true.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', and `r` is decreased by 1.**
