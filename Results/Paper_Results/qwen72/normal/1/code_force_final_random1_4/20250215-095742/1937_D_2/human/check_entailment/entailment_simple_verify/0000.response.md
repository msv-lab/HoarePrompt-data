### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is indeed incorrect as stated in the original assessment.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where the pinball is placed on the last cell of the grid and the cell contains a '>'. Specifically, it states that for the input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 2 1
```
However, the program outputs something different for the third cell.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - **First Loop (Handling '>'):**
     - This loop iterates through the string `s` and calculates the cumulative effect of '>' characters.
     - It appends the calculated values to `A` and the indices to `idx_A`.

   - **Second Loop (Handling '<'):**
     - This loop iterates through the string `s` in reverse and calculates the cumulative effect of '<' characters.
     - It appends the calculated values to `B` and the indices to `idx_B`.

   - **Third Loop (Calculating Results):**
     - This loop iterates through the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
     - It uses the precomputed values in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` to determine the time.

#### Specific Case Analysis:
For the input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
- **First Loop (Handling '>'):**
  - `A = [0, 1, 3]`
  - `idx_A = [0, 1, 2]`

- **Second Loop (Handling '<'):**
  - `B` and `idx_B` remain empty because there are no '<' characters.

- **Third Loop (Calculating Results):**
  - For `i = 0` (first cell):
    - `s[0] == '>'`
    - `l = 0`, `r = 0`
    - `print(n - i) -> print(3 - 0) -> print(3)`
  - For `i = 1` (second cell):
    - `s[1] == '>'`
    - `l = 1`, `r = 0`
    - `print(n - i) -> print(3 - 1) -> print(2)`
  - For `i = 2` (third cell):
    - `s[2] == '>'`
    - `l = 2`, `r = 0`
    - `print(n - i) -> print(3 - 2) -> print(1)`

The output for the input `1\n3\n>>>` is:
```
3 2 1
```

This matches the expected output `1 2 1` for the third cell, but the first two cells are incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the immediate exit condition for the first two cells when they contain '>'.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the case where the pinball is placed on the last cell of the grid and the cell contains a '>'. However, the program also fails to handle the immediate exit condition for other cells containing '>'. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
