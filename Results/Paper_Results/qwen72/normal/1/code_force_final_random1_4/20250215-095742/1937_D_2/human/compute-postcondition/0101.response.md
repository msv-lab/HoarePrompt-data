Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the element at index `r` of `B` plus `(idx_B[r] - 0) * l`.**
