You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: _ is t-1, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element at index i is `mex - ar[i]` for each i from 0 to len(ar) - 1, i is -1, and mex is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set {n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` in their final states as described in the annotations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the construction of the permutation `p` correctly in all cases. Specifically, the logic for updating the `mex` value and constructing the result array `res` is flawed.

### Issue Analysis:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it based on the formula `mex = mex - ar[i]`. This approach is incorrect because the MEX of a prefix of the permutation is not necessarily updated by subtracting `ar[i]` from the current `mex`.
   - The MEX of a prefix should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the prefix. The program does not correctly maintain this property.

2. **Potential Edge Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     5
     1 1 -2 1 2
     5
     1 1 1 1 1
     3
     -2 1 2
     ```
   - For the first test case, the program outputs:
     ```
     5 4 2 1 0
     ```
   - However, the correct output should be:
     ```
     0 1 4 2 3
     ```
   - The program fails to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` that satisfies the given `a` array.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of the elements that have been used in the permutation.
2. Iterate through the `a` array from the end to the beginning.
3. For each element `a[i]`, calculate the corresponding `p[i]` using the MEX of the prefix and the given `a[i]`.
4. Update the set of used elements and the MEX accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and the permutation `p` is constructed to satisfy the given `a` array.
