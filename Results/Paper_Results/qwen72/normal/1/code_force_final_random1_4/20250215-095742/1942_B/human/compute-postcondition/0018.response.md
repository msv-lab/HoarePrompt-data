Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, the element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and the element at index `len(ar) - 3` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. If `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and `i` remains `len(ar) - 3`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged and `i` remains `len(ar) - 3`.**
