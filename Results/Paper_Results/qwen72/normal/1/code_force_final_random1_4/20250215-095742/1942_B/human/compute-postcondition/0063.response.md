Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}`. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` in their final states as described in the annotations. **
