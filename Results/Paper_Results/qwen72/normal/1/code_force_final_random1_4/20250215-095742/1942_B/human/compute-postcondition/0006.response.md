The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the last element of the `res` list (since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`) with the value of `mex - ar[i]`.

- `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, `mex`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except the last element which is now `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is equal to `t`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.**
