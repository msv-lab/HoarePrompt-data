Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar`, and `i` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for variables `_`, `t`, `n`, `res`, `mex`, and `i`.
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`.
- Therefore, `ar` is now a list of integers from the user input.
