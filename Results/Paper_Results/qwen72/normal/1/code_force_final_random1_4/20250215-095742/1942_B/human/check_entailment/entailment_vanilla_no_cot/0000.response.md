Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly reconstructs a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the problem's requirements. Here's a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes the result array `res` with `None` values and sets the initial value of `mex` to `n`.

2. **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates through the array `ar` in reverse order. This is crucial because the MEX calculation depends on the elements that have already been placed in the permutation.

3. **Reconstructing `p`**:
   - For each element `ar[i]`, the function calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to the value of `mex - ar[i]` if this value is less than the current `mex`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

4. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the reconstructed permutation `res`.

The logic ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied for each element in the array `a`, and the permutation `p` is correctly constructed. Given the constraints and the problem's guarantees, the program will produce a valid permutation for each test case.
