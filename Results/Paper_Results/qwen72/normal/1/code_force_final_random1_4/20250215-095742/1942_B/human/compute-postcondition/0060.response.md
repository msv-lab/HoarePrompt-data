To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers from user input.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(ar) - 1`.
- `i` is -1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set \{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))\}.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mex`**:
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set \{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))\}.
   - This means we need to compute the set of values \{n - ar[j]\} for all elements in `ar`, and then find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in this set.

2. **Constructing `res`**:
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the list `ar`, the corresponding element in `res` is `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Therefore, `res` will contain the values `mex - ar[0]`, `mex - ar[1]`, ..., `mex - ar[n-1]`.

3. **Printing `res`**:
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space.
   - The final output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `n = 5` and `ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Calculate the set \{n - ar[j]\}:
  - \( n - ar[0] = 5 - 1 = 4 \)
  - \( n - ar[1] = 5 - 2 = 3 \)
  - \( n - ar[2] = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
  - \( n - ar[3] = 5 - 4 = 1 \)
  - \( n - ar[4] = 5 - 5 = 0 \)
  - The set is \{4, 3, 2, 1, 0\}.
- The smallest non-negative integer not in this set is `5` (since 0 through 4 are all present).
- Therefore, `mex = 5`.
- Construct `res`:
  - `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 5 - 1 = 4`
  - `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 5 - 2 = 3`
  - `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 5 - 3 = 2`
  - `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 5 - 4 = 1`
  - `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = 5 - 5 = 0`
- The list `res` is `[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
- The `print` statement will output: `4 3 2 1 0`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`, where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(ar) - 1`.

Output: **' '.join(str(mex - ar[i]) for i in range(len(ar)))** (where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set \{n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))\})
