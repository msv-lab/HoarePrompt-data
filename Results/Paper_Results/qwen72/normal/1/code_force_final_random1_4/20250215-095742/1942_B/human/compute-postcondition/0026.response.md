To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `ar`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`. In this case:
   - `start` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `stop` is `-1`
   - `step` is `-1`

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `start` is greater than or equal to `stop`.
   - This means `len(ar) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(ar) - 1` must be at least 0, which implies `len(ar)` must be at least 1.
   - The variable `i` should start at `len(ar) - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (unchanged).
- `_` is 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, and it must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` (unchanged).
- `mex` is `n` (unchanged).
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
