Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the last element of the list `res` (at index `i`) to the value of `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the last element of `res` is updated.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
