Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` (from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`) is `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `t` in reverse order. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` (this value is computed as the loop progresses), and `i` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element at index i is now `mex - ar[i]` for each i from 0 to len(ar) - 1, i is -1, and mex is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set {n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))}.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
