To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `ar`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`, where:
   - `start` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `stop` is `-1`
   - `step` is `-1`

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, the `start` value must be greater than or equal to the `stop` value. In this case, `len(ar) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `len(ar) - 1` must be at least 0, which means `len(ar)` must be at least 1. Therefore, `ar` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is initialized to `len(ar) - 1` before the loop starts.

### Adjusted State:
- `ar` must have at least one element.
- `i` is set to `len(ar) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now `n`, and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**.
