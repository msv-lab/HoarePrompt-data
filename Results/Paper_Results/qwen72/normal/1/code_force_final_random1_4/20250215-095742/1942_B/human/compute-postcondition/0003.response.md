Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`.** 

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `res` with `n` elements, where each element is set to `None`. The value of `n` is equal to `t`, and the other variables (`t`, `_`, `ar`) remain unchanged.
