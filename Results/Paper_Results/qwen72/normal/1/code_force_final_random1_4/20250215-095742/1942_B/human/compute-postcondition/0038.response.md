Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]` and the element at index `i` which is also `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.***
