Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` using the MEX operation. The key idea is to work backwards from the last element to the first, maintaining the current MEX value and updating it as needed.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible value for the MEX of the permutation.
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first.
   - For each index `i`, the value `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - The MEX value is then updated to `mex - ar[i]` if it is smaller than the current `mex`.

3. **Output**:
   - The resulting permutation `res` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the sequence. The program correctly updates the MEX value by setting it to `mex - ar[i]` when necessary. This ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: By working backwards and updating the MEX value, the program ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly. Each element `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`, which aligns with the definition of the MEX operation.
- **Correctness**: The program handles the constraints and guarantees that there is at least one valid permutation for the given data. The logic is sound and the implementation follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
