The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the range derived from the input integer. The loop will execute based on the value of this input, which is not modified within the loop itself, so the number of iterations is fixed once the loop starts.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and since the loop is iterating over `range(int(input()))`, `_` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. However, the actual value of `_` does not affect the loop's execution; it is simply a counter that increments with each iteration. The loop will continue to execute until the number of iterations specified by the input is reached.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is just the increment of `_` from 1 to 2, assuming there are more iterations left according to the input value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`, and `i`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar`, and `i` is -1**
