Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + gap`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.
- The value of `ans` is increased by `gap`.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged.
