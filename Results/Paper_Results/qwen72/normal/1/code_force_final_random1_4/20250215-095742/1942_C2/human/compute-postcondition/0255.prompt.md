Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `odd` is an empty list, `_` is incremented, `t` is `t - x`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `x - 1` if for all `i` in the range `0` to `x-1`, `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`; otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is decremented by 1, `st` is a set containing all elements from the sorted `a`, `next_elem` remains unchanged, `gap` is the last element of `even`, `even` is an empty list, and `y` is `y - sum([gap // 2 for gap in even])`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `i` is `x - 1` otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap` appended to it. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. If `gap` is not greater than 1 or is not odd, `odd` remains unchanged. If `gap` is not greater than 0 or is not even, `even` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
