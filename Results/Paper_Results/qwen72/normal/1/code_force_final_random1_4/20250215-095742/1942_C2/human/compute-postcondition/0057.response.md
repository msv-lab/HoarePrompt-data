The value of `y` is updated by subtracting the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` from its current value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is even, and `y` is now `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`.**
