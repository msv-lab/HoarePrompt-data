Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list. The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp = []` reinitializes the list `tmp` to an empty list, overriding its previous content. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `a` retains its property of being a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and its length is still used to determine the value of `i`. The value of `ans` remains `x + y - 2`.
