To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `ii` and `tt`.

- The variable `ii` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 by default when using `range()`.
- The variable `tt` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `tt` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- The second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `tt` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `tt` must be greater than 0, and `ii` should start at 0 (which is the default behavior of `range()`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
