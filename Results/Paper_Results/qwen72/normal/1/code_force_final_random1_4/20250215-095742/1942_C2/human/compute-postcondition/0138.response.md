Postcondition: ***`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least one element; `c` is the integer part of `i` divided by 2. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.***
