Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `i` is `x - 1` otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`, `even` contains the value of `gap`, `odd` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `x` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `next_elem` is determined by the condition: if `i` is `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[3]`; otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[2] - 1`.
- The `even` list now contains the value of `gap` because the code `even.append(gap)` was executed.
- The `odd` list remains unchanged.
