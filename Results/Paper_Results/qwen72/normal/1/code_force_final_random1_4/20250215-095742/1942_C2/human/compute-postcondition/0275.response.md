Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is `0`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to `0`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`. Since `y` is now `0`, this simplifies to `ans + gap + 2 * (-gap // 2)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
