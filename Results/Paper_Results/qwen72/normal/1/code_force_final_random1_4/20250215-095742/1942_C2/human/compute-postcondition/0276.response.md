Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is `0`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
