The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `y` to it. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.
   - `ans` is `ans + gap`.
   - `n` is a variable (unchanged).
   - `a` is a list (unchanged).
   - `st` is a variable (unchanged).
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
   - `gap` is the next element in `even`.
   - `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element (unchanged).
   - `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element (unchanged).
   - `y` is `y - gap // 2`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * y`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - The new value of `ans` is `ans + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.
   - `ans` is `ans + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `st` remains unchanged.
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
   - `gap` remains the next element in `even`.
   - `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element.
   - `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element.
   - `y` is `y - gap // 2`.

Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `st` remains unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` remains the next element in `even`, `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is `y - gap // 2`.**
