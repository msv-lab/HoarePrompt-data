Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order). If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to `0`, `ans` is incremented by `gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` remains as `y - gap // 2` and `ans` is incremented by `gap`.***
