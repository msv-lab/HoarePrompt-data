Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[1] - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `next_elem`, and the conditions for `odd` and `even` lists remain unchanged.
