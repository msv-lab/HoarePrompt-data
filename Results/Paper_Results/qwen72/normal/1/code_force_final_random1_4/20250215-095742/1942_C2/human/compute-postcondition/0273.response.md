The only objects in the loop head are the variable `gap` and the list `odd`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `odd`. If there are more elements in `odd`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `gap` was the second element of `odd`. For the loop to execute one more time, `gap` must now be the third element of `odd`, assuming `odd` has at least three elements.

State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + gap`**
