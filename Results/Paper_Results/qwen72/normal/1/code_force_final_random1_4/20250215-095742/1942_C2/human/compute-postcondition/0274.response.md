Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the third element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order) with at least 3 elements, `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value.
- The current value of `y` is `y - gap // 2`.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `ans + 2 * (y - gap // 2)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
