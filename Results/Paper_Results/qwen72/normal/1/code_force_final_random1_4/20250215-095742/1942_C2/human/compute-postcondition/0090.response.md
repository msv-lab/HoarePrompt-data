Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
