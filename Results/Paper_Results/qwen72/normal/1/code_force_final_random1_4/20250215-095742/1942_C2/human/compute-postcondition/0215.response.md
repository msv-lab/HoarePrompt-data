Postcondition: **`_` is incremented, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is decremented by 1, `st` is a set containing all elements from the sorted `a`, `next_elem` remains unchanged, `gap` is the last element of `even`, `odd` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` remains a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is `y - sum([gap // 2 for gap in even])`, and `t1` is not in `st` while `t2` is in `st`.**
