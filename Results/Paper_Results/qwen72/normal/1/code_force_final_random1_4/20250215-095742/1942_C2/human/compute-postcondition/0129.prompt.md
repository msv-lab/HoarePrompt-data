Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, x, and y are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; tt is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` and the total number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus the sum of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, plus 1, plus the original value of `y`. `tmp` will contain the values of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one. `y` will be decremented by the sum of half the differences minus one for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` now contains the values of the differences divided by 2 for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is even and where `y` was greater than half of this difference minus one, and now also contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
