Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The key insight is that each colored cell can affect up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

1. **Special Case Handling**: If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it means we need to color every diagonal. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). This is because each cell can cover 2 diagonals, but the last cell will cover only 1 diagonal, hence the +1.

2. **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover 2 diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, we need an additional cell to cover the extra diagonal.

Let's analyze the program:

- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It checks if \( k = 4n - 2 \). If true, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
- Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

The logic in the program matches the reasoning above. The special case is correctly handled, and the general case is also correctly computed using the ceiling function.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
