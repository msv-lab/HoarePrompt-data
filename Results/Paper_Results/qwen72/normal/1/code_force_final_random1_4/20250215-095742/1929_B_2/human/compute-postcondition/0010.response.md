To determine what will be printed by the `print(k // 2 + 1)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true.
   - Otherwise, the relationship `(4 * n - 2) != k` holds true.

2. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - The relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` means that `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.
   - If this relationship holds true, then `k` can be expressed as `k = 4 * n - 2`.

3. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` needs to be evaluated.
   - If `k = 4 * n - 2`, then we substitute `k` in the expression:
     \[
     k // 2 + 1 = (4 * n - 2) // 2 + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (4 * n - 2) // 2 = 2 * n - 1
     \]
     \[
     2 * n - 1 + 1 = 2 * n
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the relationship `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true, the expression `k // 2 + 1` simplifies to `2 * n`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output `2 * n`.

Output: **2 * n (where n is the input integer such that k = 4 * n - 2)**
