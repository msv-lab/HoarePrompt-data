Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the total number of test cases. The loop has processed each test case, and for each test case, the values of `n` and `k` were derived from the corresponding line of input. Depending on the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 4`, `4 * n - 3`, and `4 * n - 2`, the appropriate output was printed. Specifically, if `k` was less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the output was `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` was `4 * n - 3`, the output was `2 * n - 1`. If `k` was `4 * n - 2`, the output was `2 * n`. The loop has completed processing all `t` test cases, and no further changes to `t`, `n`, or `k` will occur.**
