To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) the length of the list `lis`. For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:

1. `len(lis)` must be greater than 1. This ensures that the range `range(1, len(lis))` has at least one element (i.e., the number 1).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`
- `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`
- `test` is True

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `lis` has at least two elements.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements
- `j` is 1
- `test` is True

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, `test` is True**
