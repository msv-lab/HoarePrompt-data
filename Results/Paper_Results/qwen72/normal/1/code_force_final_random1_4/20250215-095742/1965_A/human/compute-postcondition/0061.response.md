Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, and `test` is True.*** 

Explanation: Since the if and else parts do not change any of the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition regardless of whether the if condition (`j % 2 == 1`) is true or false.
