To determine what will be printed by the `print('Alice')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 4 elements.
   - `j` is 3.
   - If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement following the if block.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('Alice')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print('Alice')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs a constant string, it will always print `'Alice'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **Alice**
