Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`, and `test` is either True or False depending on whether the loop found any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: Remains a map object containing integers from the input as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`lis`**: Remains a sorted list of unique integers from `l` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`j`**: This variable will be the index where the loop broke out due to finding a gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements, or it will be the last index of `lis` if no such gap was found.
- **`test`**: This variable will be set to False if the loop found any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`. If no such gap was found, `test` will remain True.
