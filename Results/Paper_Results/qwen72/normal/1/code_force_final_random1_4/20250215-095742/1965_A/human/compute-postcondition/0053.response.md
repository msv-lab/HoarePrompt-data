Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is 1, but it is also specified that `j` is even, which means there might be a contradiction unless `j` is updated to an even number later.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of those variables.

Output: **Alice**
