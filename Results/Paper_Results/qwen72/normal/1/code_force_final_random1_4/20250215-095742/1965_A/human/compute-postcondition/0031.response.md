Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `1` is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 2, `test` is False, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement we are currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
