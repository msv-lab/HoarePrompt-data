Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is 1.
- The difference between the second element (`lis[1]`) and the first element (`lis[0]`) of `lis` is greater than 1.
- `j` is odd (specifically, `j` is 1).

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `j`.

Output: **Bob**
