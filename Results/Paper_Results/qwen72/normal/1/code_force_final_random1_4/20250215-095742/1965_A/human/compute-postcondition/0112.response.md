Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. `test` is True, indicating that the loop found at least one gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`, and the length of `lis` can be either an odd or an even number.**
