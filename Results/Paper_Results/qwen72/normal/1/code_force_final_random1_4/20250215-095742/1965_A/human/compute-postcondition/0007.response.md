To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `set_`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, len(set_))` contains at least one value.
   - This means `len(set_)` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts at 1).

3. **Adjust States:**
   - The state of `i` will be set to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - The state of `set_` must be such that its length is greater than 1.

4. **Other States:**
   - The other states (`arr`, `A`, `not_c`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `i` is 1.
- `set_` must have a length greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `A` is False, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order and must have a length greater than 1, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1**.
