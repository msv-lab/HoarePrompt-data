To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is 1.
- If the difference between the second element (`lis[1]`) and the first element (`lis[0]`) of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `len(lis) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
- `j` should be incremented by 1 to 2 for the next iteration.
- The length of `lis` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time (since `j` will be 2 and the loop condition is `j < len(lis)`).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2**.
