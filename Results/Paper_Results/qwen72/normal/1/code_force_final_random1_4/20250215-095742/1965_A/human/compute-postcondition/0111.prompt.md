Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, `test` is False. Otherwise, `test` is True, indicating that the loop found at least one gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `lis`, and the length of `lis` can be either an odd or an even number.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, and `j` is 1. If the difference between the second element (`lis[1]`) and the first element (`lis[0]`) of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` remains 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement following the if block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement following the if block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
