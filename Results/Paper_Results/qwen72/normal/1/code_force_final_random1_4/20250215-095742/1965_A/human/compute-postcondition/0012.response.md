Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `A` is True, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order and must have a length greater than 1, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `A` is toggled from `False` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
