### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the list `arr` as input.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`.
   - It checks if the first element of `arr` is not equal to 1. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is because if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by removing all stones from all piles in one move.
   - If the first element of `arr` is 1, it proceeds to create a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` called `set_`.
   - It then iterates through `set_` to check if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a pair, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - During the iteration, it toggles the value of `A` (i.e., `A = not A`).
   - After the loop, if `not_c` is still `True`, it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.

3. **Logical Analysis**:
   - The logic of the program is based on the idea that if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by removing all stones from all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly 1 stone, the game becomes more complex. The program checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. If they are, it means the game can be reduced to a sequence of moves where each player removes 1 stone from each non-empty pile until one player cannot make a move.
   - The toggling of `A` is used to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of unique pile sizes. If the number of unique pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the smallest pile has more than 1 stone.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the smallest pile has exactly 1 stone and the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: **True****
