Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
