Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cur` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
