Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string with any number of characters.
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters.
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
