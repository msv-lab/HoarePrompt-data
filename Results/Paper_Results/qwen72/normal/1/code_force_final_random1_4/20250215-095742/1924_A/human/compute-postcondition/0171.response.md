The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves parameters `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. The function likely accepts these parameters either through arguments or from a predefined source (like input from stdin).

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
  - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
  - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
  - `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.

Given these constraints, the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters and the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters and the string `s`.**
