Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s` followed by the third character of `s`, `cur` is 0, and `tmp` is an empty string or the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += ss` appends the third character of `s` (stored in `ss`) to the string `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` was either an empty string or contained the first character of `s`.
- After appending `ss`, `ans` now contains the first character of `s` followed by the third character of `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
