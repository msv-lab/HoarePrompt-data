Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `cur` to 0, which resets the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `cur` is now 0, `tmp` will be the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur`, which is effectively the first character in the sequence, or an empty string if all bits are set (which is not the case here since `cur` is 0).
