The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m` using the `map` function to convert them to integers. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
