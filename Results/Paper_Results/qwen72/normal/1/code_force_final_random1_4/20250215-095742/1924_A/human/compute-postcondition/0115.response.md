The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables, while the rest of the variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2 or `k + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a new input string
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0
- `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence
- `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated to the values read from the input.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**
