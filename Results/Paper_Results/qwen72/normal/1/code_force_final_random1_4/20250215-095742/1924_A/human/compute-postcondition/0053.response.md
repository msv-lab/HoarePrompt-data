The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Review**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string with any number of characters.
   - `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`.
   - `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.
   - `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position `i` in `cur` that was 0, or it remains as the last character set (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.) if no such bit was found.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `tmp` is appended to the string `ans`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `ans` is now the original value of `ans` plus the value of `tmp`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the value of `tmp`, `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position `i` in `cur` that was 0, or it remains as the last character set (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.) if no such bit was found.**
