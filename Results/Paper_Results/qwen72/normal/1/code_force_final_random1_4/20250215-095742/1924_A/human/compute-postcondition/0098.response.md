Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'a', and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is 0, `ord('a') + i` equals `97` (which is the ASCII value of `'a'`).
- Therefore, `tmp` is set to `'a'`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
