To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the first input integer
- `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0
- `m` is the third input integer
- `s` is a new input string
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0
- `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence
- `tmp` is an empty string if `cur & 1 << i` is not 0, otherwise `tmp` is the character 'a'
- `cnt` is less than `n`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range defined by `k`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `k`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is an empty string if `cur & 1 << i` is not 0, otherwise `tmp` is the character 'a', and `cnt` is less than `n`**
