### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of complete subsequences found, `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen, and `ans` to store the constructed string.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
     - Updates the bitmask `cur` if the character has not been seen before.
     - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen at least once, so it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - Appends the character to `ans` if a complete subsequence is found.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, prints "YES".
     - If false, prints "NO" and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - Finds the first character that is missing from the current bitmask.
       - Appends this character to `ans` and fills the rest with 'a'.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for constructing the string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. The code appends the missing character and then appends 'a' to fill the rest of the string. This does not guarantee that the constructed string will not occur as a subsequence.
   - The code does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence. It should generate a string that is guaranteed to not be a subsequence, which is not always achieved by the current logic.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
