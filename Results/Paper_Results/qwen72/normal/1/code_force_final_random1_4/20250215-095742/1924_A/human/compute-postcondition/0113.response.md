Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains 1 or `k`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is set to `k-1`, `ans` is extended by the character in `tmp` followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set. `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence.***
