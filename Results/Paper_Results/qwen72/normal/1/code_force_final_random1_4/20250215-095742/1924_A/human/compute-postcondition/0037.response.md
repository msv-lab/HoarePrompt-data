The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`, the output will always be:

Output: **NO**
