Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from the previous `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in the previous `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ans`, and `cur`) retain their initial values or conditions as described in the initial state.
