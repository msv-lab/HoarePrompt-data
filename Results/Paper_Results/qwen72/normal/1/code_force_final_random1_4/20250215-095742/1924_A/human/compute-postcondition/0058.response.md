The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Let's list the impact of the code on the program:

1. `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
2. `k` is assigned the second integer from the input.
3. `m` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters.**
