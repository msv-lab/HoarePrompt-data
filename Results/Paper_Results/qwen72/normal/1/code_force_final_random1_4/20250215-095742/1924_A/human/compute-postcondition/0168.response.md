To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is the third input integer.
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0.
   - `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0 and now includes the character `tmp` if `tmp` is not an empty string, followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.
   - `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence.
   - `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is constructed by concatenating:
     - Characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0.
     - The character `tmp` if it is not an empty string.
     - `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - The characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0 are included in `ans`.
   - If `tmp` is not an empty string, it is appended to `ans`.
   - Finally, `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters are appended to `ans`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be a string that consists of:
- Characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0.
- The character `tmp` if it is not an empty string.
- `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.

Since the exact values of `s`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **[characters from s that caused cur to be reset to 0][tmp if not empty][(n - cnt - 1) 'a' characters]**
