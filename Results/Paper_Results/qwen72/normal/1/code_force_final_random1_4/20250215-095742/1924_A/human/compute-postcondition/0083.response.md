The code snippet updates the value of `cur_ss` by calculating the ASCII value of the third character of the string `s` and subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from it.

- `cur_ss` is set to the ASCII value of `ss` (which is the third character of `s`) minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- The initial state specifies that `ss` is the third character of `s`, and `s` is a new input string with at least 3 characters.
- The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `cur_ss` is effectively the position of `ss` in the alphabet starting from 0 (e.g., 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character of `s` in the alphabet (0-indexed), `cur` remains unchanged.**
