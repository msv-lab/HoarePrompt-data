Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'c'.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `97 + 2 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
