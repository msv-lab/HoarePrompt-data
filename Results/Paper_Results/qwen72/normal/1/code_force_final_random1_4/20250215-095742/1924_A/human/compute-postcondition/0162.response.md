Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'c'.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is assigned the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)`.
- Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `ord('a') + 2`, which is `97 + 2 = 99`.
- `chr(99)` is the character 'c'.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
