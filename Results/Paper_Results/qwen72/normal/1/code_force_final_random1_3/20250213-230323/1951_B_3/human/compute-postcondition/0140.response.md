Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `s[1]`, `n` and `k` retain their original values, `ans1` will be incremented based on conditions described, `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` equals `h`, otherwise it will remain 0, `ans` is 0, `h` is now equal to the value of `s[0]` (which was originally the value of `s[k-1]`), `j` is 0, and `h` is less than `i`.**
