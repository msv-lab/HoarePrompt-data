Postcondition: ***`s` must have at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `s`. If `i` == `h`, `z` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
