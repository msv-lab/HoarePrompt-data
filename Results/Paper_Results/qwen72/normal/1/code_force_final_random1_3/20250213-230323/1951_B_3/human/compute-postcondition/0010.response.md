Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]; `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing `[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains an empty list; `c` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 2, `c` remains 0, and `i` remains 0.***
