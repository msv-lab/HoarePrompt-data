Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`. Given that `ind` is not an empty list and its length is not equal to 1, `ind` contains at least two elements. The first element of `ind` is 0, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. If `k` is 14, the program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and 13.**
