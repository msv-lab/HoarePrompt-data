Postcondition: ***`s` must have at least one element, and `i` is the first element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
