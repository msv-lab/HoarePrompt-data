Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and all a_i's are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions, `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of `s` that was processed before the loop broke or ended. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]`, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the loop broke out because `i` is greater than `h`, and `ans1` and `z` remain as they were before the loop broke. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]`, and `z` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 0, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` retains its original length, and `i` will have iterated through each element of `s`. If any element in `s` equals `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` will be incremented by 1 for each such occurrence. If any element in `s` is greater than `h`, the loop will break prematurely. If `z` is set to 1 (indicating that an element equal to `h` was found), and subsequent elements are less than or equal to `h`, `ans1` will be incremented by 1 for each such element. The final value of `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` equals `h`, otherwise it will remain 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `s` retains its original values, `i` is the last element of `s` that was processed, `z` is 1 if any element in `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 0, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are equal to `h` and occur after the first occurrence of `h` in `s`, or the count of elements less than or equal to `h` if `h` never appears in `s`. The loop terminates when it encounters an element greater than `h` or when all elements have been processed. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
