Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is 14, and `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and is less than or equal to `k`. Since `ind[0]` is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`, the program calculates the maximum distance between `k` and `ind[0]`, or `ind[0]` and 1.**
