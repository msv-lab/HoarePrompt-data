Postcondition: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]. `x` is still the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` contains the indices of up to the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. `c` is 2 if there were at least two elements in `a` greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` (which could be 0 or 1). The loop breaks as soon as `c` reaches 2. If `k` is 14, this condition is explicitly noted. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The length of `ind` is not equal to 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0. `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.**
