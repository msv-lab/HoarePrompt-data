Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s[0]` is now the original value of `s[k - 1]`, `s[k - 1]` is now the original value of `s[p]`, `s[p]` is now the original value of `s[k - 1]`, `h` is now the original value of `s[0]`, `z` is 0, `i` is the last element of `s` excluding the first element, `n` and `k` retain their original values, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` â‰¤ `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element of `s`. If `i` == `h`, `z` is 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element of `s`. If `i` == `h`, `z` is 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
