Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The first and the last elements of `s` are swapped back to their original positions if `p` is 0. Otherwise, `s[p]` is now equal to the original `s[0]`, and `s[k - 1]` is now equal to the original `s[p]`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `p`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `h`, and `z`) remain unchanged, and `ans1` is 0. Additionally, `z` is now 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` must have at least one element, and `i` is the first element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` must have at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `s`. If `i` == `h`, `z` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` has at least three elements, and `i` is the third element in `s`. If `i` == `h`, `z` is set to 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
