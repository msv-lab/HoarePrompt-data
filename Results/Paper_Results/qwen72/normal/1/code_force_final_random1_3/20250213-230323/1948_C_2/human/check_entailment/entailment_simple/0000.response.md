Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, the first row `a`, and the second row `b`. This aligns with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The outer loop iterates through each test case, which is correct.

3. **Movement Logic**: The inner loop iterates through the columns in steps of 2, starting from 1. This is because the robot must move in such a way that it alternates between rows, and the problem specifies that `n` is even. The loop checks if the robot can get stuck by moving into a cell with an arrow that points back to a previously visited cell.

4. **Stuck Condition**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` checks if the robot can get stuck:
   - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`: If the robot is at `(1, i)` and the arrow at `(1, i)` points left (`<`) and the arrow at `(2, i+1)` also points left (`<`), the robot will get stuck.
   - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`: If the robot is at `(1, i)` and the arrow at `(1, i)` points left (`<`) and the arrow at `(2, i-1)` also points left (`<`), the robot will get stuck.

5. **Output**: If the robot gets stuck, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding a stuck condition, the program prints 'Yes'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the robot does not get stuck in a loop and can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

However, there is a small issue with the output format. The problem specifies that the output should be `YES` or `NO` (case-insensitive), but the program prints `No` and `yes`. To fix this, we should change the output to uppercase.

Corrected Output:
```python
print('NO')
```
and
```python
print('YES')
```

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the output format. However, since the problem states that the output can be recognized in any case, the program is still considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
