Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues if `_` is less than `t`. The program prints 'yes' if it did not break out of the loop during any iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
