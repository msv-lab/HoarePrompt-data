Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of columns in a grid, followed by two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, each containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if there exists any pair of adjacent columns (i, i+1) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such a pair is found, the function prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such pair is found for all columns, the function prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output ('Yes' or 'No') has been printed for each. **
