The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to process input data that includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) which is always even, representing the number of columns in a grid. Each grid has two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The function returns the result of processing these grids, which is not explicitly defined in the problem statement but typically involves some computation or analysis of the grid configurations.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a grid with two rows of arrows ('<' and '>'), and returns a result based on the configuration of the arrows in the grid.**
