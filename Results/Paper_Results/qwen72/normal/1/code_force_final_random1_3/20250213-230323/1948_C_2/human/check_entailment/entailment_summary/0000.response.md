Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by checking if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the movement rules and the direction of the arrows in the grid. The key logic in the program is to check for specific conditions where the robot might get stuck or blocked from reaching the target cell.

However, the logic implemented in the program is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` does not correctly capture all scenarios where the robot might be unable to reach the target cell. This condition only checks for specific pairs of cells where the arrows point left, but it does not consider the overall path the robot must take to reach (2, n).

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell, we need to simulate the robot's movements according to the rules provided. The robot must be able to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the arrows and making valid moves. The program should track the robot's position and ensure it can eventually reach the target cell without getting stuck.

Given the provided logic, the program may incorrectly conclude that the robot cannot reach the target cell in some cases where it actually can, and vice versa.

Correctness: **False**
