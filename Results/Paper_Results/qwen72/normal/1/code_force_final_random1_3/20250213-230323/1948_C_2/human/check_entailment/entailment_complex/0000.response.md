Reasoning:  
The function `func` aims to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the given grid configuration. The logic in the function checks for specific conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell. Specifically, it looks for pairs of adjacent columns where the arrows in those columns would trap the robot in a loop or force it to move back to a previous column, making it impossible to reach the end.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not correctly identifying the scenarios where the robot gets trapped. The condition should check if the robot can move from one column to the next without getting stuck.

2. **Odd and Even Column Handling**: The loop iterates over every second column (`for i in range(1, n, 2)`), which means it skips some columns. This might miss important transitions between columns that could affect the robot's path.

3. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The output should be consistent in case sensitivity. The function currently prints 'No' and 'yes', but the problem statement specifies that the output can be in any case (e.g., 'YES', 'Yes', 'YeS'). It would be better to standardize the output to 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
