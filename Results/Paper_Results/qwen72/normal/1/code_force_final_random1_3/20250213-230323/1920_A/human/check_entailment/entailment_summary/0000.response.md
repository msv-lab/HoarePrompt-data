### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input when `isOne` is `False`. It correctly handles the input and returns an integer, which matches the problem's requirement.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the constraints for each test case. The function correctly handles the input and returns a list of integers, which is appropriate for the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program. It concatenates a list of integers into a string with a specified delimiter, but it is not necessary for solving the problem.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function finds the indices of a substring within a string. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for solving the problem.

5. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function finds the indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for solving the problem.

6. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function finds a sublist in a list of lists where a specific element at a given index matches a value. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not necessary for solving the problem.

7. **Function `func_7`:**
   - This function processes the constraints for a single test case. It correctly updates the `start` and `end` boundaries based on the type of constraints. It also counts the number of values in the `num` list that fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it calculates and returns the number of integers that satisfy all constraints.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `start` is greater than `end`, returning 0 in such cases.
   - The function also correctly handles the subtraction of the count of invalid values from the total range, ensuring the result is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. All functions used in the main logic (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_7`) work as expected and handle the input and constraints appropriately. The additional functions (`func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, and `func_6`) are not used in the main logic and do not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
