Output State: **`num` is still a list containing at least one element. `i` will be the next element in `num` (the third element if the list has at least three elements). If `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_num` remains unchanged.**
