The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list containing at least one element.
- `i` is the first element in `num`.
- The current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.

The `continue` statement will cause the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of `num`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element in `num`, and the current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
