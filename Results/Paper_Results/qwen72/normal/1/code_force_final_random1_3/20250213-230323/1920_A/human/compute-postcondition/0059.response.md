Output State: **The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).**
