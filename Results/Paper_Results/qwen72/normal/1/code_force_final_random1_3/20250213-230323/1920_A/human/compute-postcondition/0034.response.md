Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is a list. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` was greater than `v`, then `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` remains unchanged. `t` and `v` are integers provided by user input. `end` is now `v`.**
