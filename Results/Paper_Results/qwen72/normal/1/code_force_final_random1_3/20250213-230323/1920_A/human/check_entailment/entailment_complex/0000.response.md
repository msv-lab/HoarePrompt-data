### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases from the user input if `isOne` is `False`. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns 1. This function is used to get the number of test cases, and it works correctly for the given problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and processes it based on the `space` and `to_int` parameters. It splits the input by spaces if `space` is `True` and converts the items to integers if `to_int` is `True`. This function is used to read and process the constraints, and it works correctly for the given problem.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function concatenates the elements of a list into a string, with a specified separator. It is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not relevant to the overall problem.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string and returns their indices. It is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not relevant to the overall problem.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function finds all indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not relevant to the overall problem.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - This function finds the first sublist in a list of lists where the element at a specified index matches a given value. It is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not relevant to the overall problem.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**:
   - This function processes the constraints for a single test case. It reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint. It updates the `start` and `end` boundaries based on the type of constraint and keeps track of the values that should be excluded (`num`). Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints and returns this count.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It also handles edge cases where `start` is greater than `end` and returns 0 in such cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case. The functions used in the main logic (`func_1` and `func_7`) work as expected, and the other functions, though not used in the main logic, do not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
