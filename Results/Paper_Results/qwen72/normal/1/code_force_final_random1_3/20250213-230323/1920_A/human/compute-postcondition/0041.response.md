To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `num` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `num` is a non-empty list. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `count_num`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given the state before the loop starts, `num` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `num` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num` must be a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element in `num`**
