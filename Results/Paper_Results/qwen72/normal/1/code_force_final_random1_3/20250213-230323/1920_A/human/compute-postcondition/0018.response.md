Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` and `v` are input integers. If `t` is 1, `start` is set to `v` if `v` is greater than -1, otherwise `start` remains -1. If `t` is 2, `start` is -1, and if `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `start` is -1 if `t` was 2 or remains as previously set if `t` was 1.***
