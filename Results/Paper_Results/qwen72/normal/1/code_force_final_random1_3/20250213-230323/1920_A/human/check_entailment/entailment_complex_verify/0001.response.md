Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_7` correctly reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes the range for `k` with `start` set to `-1` and `end` set to `1000000000.0`. This initialization ensures that any valid constraints will update these values appropriately.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), the function updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), the function updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the function appends `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Range Validation**: After processing all constraints, the function checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns `0` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.

4. **Counting Excluded Values**: The function iterates through the list `num` to count how many of these excluded values fall within the range `[start, end]`. This count is stored in `count_num`.

5. **Final Calculation**: The function calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the number of excluded values. It ensures the result is non-negative by returning `0` if the calculated value is negative.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where the range is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) by returning `0`.

7. **Type Consistency**: The function uses `int` for all integer operations and comparisons, ensuring type consistency and avoiding potential issues with floating-point arithmetic.

8. **Efficiency**: The function processes each constraint in constant time, making it efficient for the given constraints (up to 100 constraints per test case).

Given the above steps, the function `func_7` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
