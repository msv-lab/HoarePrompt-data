Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `end` is `v`, `num` is an empty list, `t` is 2, `v` is an input integer, `start` is -1, and `end` is greater than `v`.**

Explanation: The value of `end` is updated to be equal to the value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `end` was initially greater than `v`, this condition is no longer valid after the update, but it is included in the output state for completeness.
