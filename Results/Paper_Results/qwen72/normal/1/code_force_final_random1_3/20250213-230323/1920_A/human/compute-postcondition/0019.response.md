The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` and `v` are input integers. If `t` is 1, `start` is set to `v` if `v` is greater than -1, otherwise `start` remains -1. If `t` is 2, `start` is -1, and if `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `start` is -1 if `t` was 2 or remains as previously set if `t` was 1.**
