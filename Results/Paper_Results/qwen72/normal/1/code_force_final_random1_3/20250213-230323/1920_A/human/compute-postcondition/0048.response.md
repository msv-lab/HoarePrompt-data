Output State: **`num` is still a list containing at least one element, `i` will be the next element in `num` (the second element if the list has at least two elements), and the conditions for `i` being less than `start`, greater than `end`, or within the range `[start, end]` will be re-evaluated for the new value of `i`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
