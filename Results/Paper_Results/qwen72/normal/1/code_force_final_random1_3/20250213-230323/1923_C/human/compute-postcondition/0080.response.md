Postcondition: **`n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of 1s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of 1s up to index `a - 1` in the list `c`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. Additionally, the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1, and the difference between the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a` to `b` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between these indices.**
