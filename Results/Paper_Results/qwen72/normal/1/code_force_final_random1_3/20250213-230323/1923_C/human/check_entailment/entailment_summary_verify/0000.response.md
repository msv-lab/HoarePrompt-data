### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray \( c[l_i : r_i] \) must equal the sum of the corresponding subarray \( b[l_i : r_i] \).
2. **Difference Condition**: Each element in \( b \) must be different from the corresponding element in \( c \).
3. **Positive Condition**: Each element in \( b \) must be greater than 0.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses two cumulative lists:
- `p`: Cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
- `c`: Cumulative count of 1s in `l`.

For each query, it calculates:
- `i`: Number of 1s in the subarray \( c[l_i : r_i] \).
- `s`: Sum of the subarray \( c[l_i : r_i] \).

It then checks the condition:
```python
if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

#### Explanation of the Condition:
- `b - a + 1 > 1`: Ensures the subarray has at least two elements.
- `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: Ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray.

This condition is designed to check if it is possible to construct a subarray `b` such that:
- The sum of `b` equals the sum of `c[l_i : r_i]`.
- Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c[l_i : r_i]`.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

#### Validity of the Condition:
- **Sum Condition**: The sum of `b` must equal the sum of `c[l_i : r_i]`, which is `s`.
- **Difference Condition**: To ensure each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c[l_i : r_i]`, we need to change each element in `c[l_i : r_i]` to a different positive integer.
- **Positive Condition**: Each element in `b` must be greater than 0.

The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the number of 1s. This is necessary because:
- If there are `i` ones in the subarray, we need to change each of these ones to a different positive integer.
- The minimum change for each 1 is to change it to 2 (the smallest different positive integer), which increases the sum by 1 for each 1.

Thus, the total increase in the sum needed is at least `i` (the number of 1s). Therefore, the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray can be maintained while changing all elements to different positive integers.

#### Counterexample Revisited:
For the subarray `c[1:5]` (which is `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`):
- Sum of `c[1:5]` is `1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 13`.
- Number of 1s in `c[1:5]` is 2.
- Length of the subarray is 5.

The condition becomes:
- `13 - 5 >= 2` which simplifies to `8 >= 2`, which is true.

This means it is possible to construct a subarray `b` such that:
- The sum of `b` is 13.
- Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c[1:5]`.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

One possible construction of `b` could be `[2, 3, 2, 3, 3]`, which satisfies all conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly identifies whether a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
