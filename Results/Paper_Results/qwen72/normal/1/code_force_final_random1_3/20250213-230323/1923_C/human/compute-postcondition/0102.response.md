The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple parts (based on spaces), converts each part into an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `n` and `m` are integers read from user input
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined within the loop body.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `l` will be updated to contain a list of integers derived from the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.**
