The value of `j` is appended to the list `c`. Initially, `c` is `[0]`, and `j` is 0 if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 1. After appending `j` to `c`, the new value of `c` will be `[0, j]`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, x]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is `x`, `j` is 0 if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `x` is the first element of `l`, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged.**
