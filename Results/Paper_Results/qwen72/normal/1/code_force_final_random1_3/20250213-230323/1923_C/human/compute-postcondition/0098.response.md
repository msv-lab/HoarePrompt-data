Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the loop will execute `m-2` more times. Otherwise, the loop will also execute `m-2` more times.***
