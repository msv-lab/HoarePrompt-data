To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is incremented by 1. This does not affect the print statement directly.
2. `n` and `m` are integers read from user input. These are used to define the size of the list `l` and other conditions.
3. `l` is a list of integers read from user input.
4. `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
5. `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
6. `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
7. `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the number of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.
8. `j` is the count of 1s in the entire list `l`.
9. `m` must be greater than 0.
10. `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`, which represents the sum of the elements in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.
11. There are conditions involving `b - a + 1`, `s`, and `i`.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement is executed unconditionally. The conditions provided do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself; they only describe the state of the program.

Therefore, the output of the `print('NO')` statement will always be:

Output: **NO**
