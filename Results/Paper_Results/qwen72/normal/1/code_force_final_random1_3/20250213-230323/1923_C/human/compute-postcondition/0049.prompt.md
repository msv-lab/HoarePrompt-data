Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers with all its elements processed, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` starting from 0, `c` is a list containing the cumulative counts of the number of 1s encountered in `l` starting from 0, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 and the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than or equal to 1, or the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 and the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than or equal to 1, or the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
