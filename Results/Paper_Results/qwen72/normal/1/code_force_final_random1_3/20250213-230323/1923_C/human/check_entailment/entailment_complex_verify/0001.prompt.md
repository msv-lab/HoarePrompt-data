You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `_` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The lists `p` and `c` have been updated to contain the cumulative sums and counts of 1s, respectively, for each list `l` of integers provided in the input. The variables `n` and `m` retain their values as the number of elements in `l` and the number of queries, respectively, for each test case. The variables `i` and `s` are updated for each query based on the cumulative sums and counts stored in `p` and `c`. For each query, if the conditions `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final state of the loop is such that all test cases and their respective queries have been processed, and the appropriate outputs have been generated for each query.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `m`. It then reads a list of `n` integers. The function computes two cumulative lists: one for the sum of the elements (`p`) and another for the count of 1s (`c`). For each query, it checks if the segment of the list meets a specific condition and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases and their queries, the function has no return value but has printed the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l...r]` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in `c[l...r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     - No element in `c[l...r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray to be "good," it must contain at least one element that is not 1. This is because if all elements are 1, it's impossible to find a different positive integer for each element while maintaining the same sum.
   - If the subarray has at least one element greater than 1, we can always construct a valid `b` by decrementing the elements greater than 1 and incrementing the elements that are 1.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `l` and constructs two prefix arrays:
     - `p`: Prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of elements.
     - `c`: Prefix count array to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1.
   - For each query, it calculates:
     - The sum of the subarray `s = p[b] - p[a-1]`.
     - The count of 1s in the subarray `i = c[b] - c[a-1]`.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.

4. **Verification:**
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the subarray has enough "slack" to adjust the elements to form a valid `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
