To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python, often used when the value of the iterator is not needed. For the loop to start, `_` should be set to 0, and `m` should be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
