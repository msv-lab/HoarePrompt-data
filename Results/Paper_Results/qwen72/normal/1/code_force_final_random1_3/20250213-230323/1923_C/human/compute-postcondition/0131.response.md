To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is incremented by 1. This does not affect the `print` statement directly.
2. `n` and `m` are integers read from user input.
3. `l` is a list of integers read from user input.
4. `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
5. `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
6. `i` is the count of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.
7. `j` is the count of 1s in `l`.
8. `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
9. `m` must be greater than 0.
10. `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`.
11. The length of the sublist `l[a-1:b]` is greater than 1.
12. The difference between `s` and the length of the sublist `l[a-1:b]` is greater than or equal to `i`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions provided do not influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
