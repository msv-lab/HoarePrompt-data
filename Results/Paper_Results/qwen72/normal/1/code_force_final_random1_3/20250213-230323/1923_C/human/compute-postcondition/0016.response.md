The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since `x` can be either 0 or 1, the value of `i` will either remain the same (if `x` is 0) or increase by 1 (if `x` is 1). The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`]. If `x` == 1, then `i` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` == 1 (if `j` was 0, it becomes 1; if `j` was 1, it becomes 2); otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**
