Output State: **`_` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 and the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than or equal to 1, or the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than `i`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `_` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- The expressions for `i` and `s` remain the same, but `a` and `b` are now specific input integers.
- The conditions involving `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain the same, but they are now evaluated with the specific values of `a` and `b`.
