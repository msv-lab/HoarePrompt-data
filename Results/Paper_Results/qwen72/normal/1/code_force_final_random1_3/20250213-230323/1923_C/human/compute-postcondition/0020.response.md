The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` was part of the list `c` which contains the elements `[0, j, j]`, the updated value of `j` will also affect the second and third elements of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j + 1`, `j + 1`], `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is incremented by 1.**
