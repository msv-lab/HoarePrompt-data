Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last set of input integers provided during the final iteration, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of 1s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of 1s up to index `a - 1` in the list `c`, `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum of elements up to index `b` and the cumulative sum of elements up to index `a - 1` in the list `p`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. For each iteration, if the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1 and the difference between the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a` to `b` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between these indices, then "YES" is printed. Otherwise, "NO" is printed.**
