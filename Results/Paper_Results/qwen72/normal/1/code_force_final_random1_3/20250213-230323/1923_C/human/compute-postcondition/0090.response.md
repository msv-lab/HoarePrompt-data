Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are input integers with `m` being greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are new input integers.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
