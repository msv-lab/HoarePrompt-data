Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are input integers with `m` being greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are new input integers.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
