The code snippet `p.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` is initially a list containing the elements `[0, i + x, i + x]`. After appending `i` to `p`, the list `p` will contain `[0, i + x, i + x, i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `c`, `j`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i + x`, `i + x`, `i`]. If `x` (the next element in the list `l`) is 1, then `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j + 1`, `j + 1`] and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` remains a list containing the elements [0, `j`, `j`].**
