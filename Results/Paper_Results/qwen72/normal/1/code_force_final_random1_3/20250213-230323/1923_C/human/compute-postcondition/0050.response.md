The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value provided by `int(input())`. After the previous iteration, `_` is `m-1` and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it `m`.

Since the loop is controlled by the range function, which generates a sequence from 0 up to but not including the specified number of iterations, the next value of `_` should be `m`.

State: **_ is m, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**
