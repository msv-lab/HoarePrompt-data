To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (this doesn't affect the print statement).
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from user input.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from user input.
   - `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
   - `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the count of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.
   - `j` is the count of 1s in the entire list `l`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`, which represents the sum of the elements in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the same conditions hold.
   - Otherwise, the same conditions also hold.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute because the conditions are structured in such a way that they always hold true. This means that regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and `i`, the conditions will always evaluate to true, leading to the execution of the `print('YES')` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
