Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
