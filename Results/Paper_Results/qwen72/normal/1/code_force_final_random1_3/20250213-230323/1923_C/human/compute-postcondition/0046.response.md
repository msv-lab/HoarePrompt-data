Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
