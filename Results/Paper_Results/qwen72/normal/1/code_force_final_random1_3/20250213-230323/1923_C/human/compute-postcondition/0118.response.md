The code snippet `c.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the end of the list `c`. Based on the initial state, we know:

- `c` is initially `[0, j]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `c` is `[0, j + 1]`.
- `j` is 0 if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 2.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `x` is not 1:
   - `c` is `[0, j]` which is `[0, 0]`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - After appending `j` to `c`, `c` becomes `[0, 0, 0]`.

2. If `x` is 1:
   - `c` is `[0, j + 1]` which is `[0, 2]`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - After appending `j` to `c`, `c` becomes `[0, 2, 2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- If `x` is not 1: `c` is `[0, 0, 0]`.
- If `x` is 1: `c` is `[0, 2, 2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, x, 2 * x]`, `i` is `2 * x`, `x` is the second element of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged, if `x` is not 1 then `c` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `j` is 0, otherwise if `x` is 1 then `c` is `[0, 2, 2]` and `j` is 2.**
