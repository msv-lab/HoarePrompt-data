Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers with all its elements processed, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` starting from 0, `c` is a list containing the cumulative counts of the number of 1s encountered in `l` starting from 0, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` retains its original value within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variables `n` and `m` retain their original values as integers read from input.
- The list `l` has been fully processed, meaning all its elements have been iterated over.
- The list `p` contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, starting from 0. For example, if `l` is [2, 1, 3], then `p` will be [0, 2, 3, 6].
- The list `c` contains the cumulative counts of the number of 1s encountered in `l`, starting from 0. For example, if `l` is [2, 1, 3, 1], then `c` will be [0, 0, 1, 1, 2].
- The variable `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- The variable `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.
