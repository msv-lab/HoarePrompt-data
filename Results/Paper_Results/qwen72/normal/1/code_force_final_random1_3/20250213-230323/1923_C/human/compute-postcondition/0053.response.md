The code snippet initializes the list `p` to `[0]`. This impacts the variable `p`, changing its value from whatever it was previously to a list containing only the integer `0`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is `[0]`.**
