The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `_` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1 and the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than or equal to 1, or the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is less than `i`.**
