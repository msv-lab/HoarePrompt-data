To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.
   - `s` and `m` are the first and second values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.
   - `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)`, and it contains at least one pair.
   - `l` and `r` are the next pair in `ops`.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)` will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

3. **Values of `l` and `r`:**
   - Since `ops` is a list of pairs, and `l` and `r` are the next pair in `ops`, `l` and `r` are integers representing indices or values from the list `a`.
   - The exact values of `l` and `r` depend on the specific implementation of `func_2(a)`, but they are guaranteed to be valid indices or values from the list `a`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will add 1 to both `l` and `r` before printing them.
   - Therefore, the output will be the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the next pair in the list `ops`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the next pair in the list ops)**
