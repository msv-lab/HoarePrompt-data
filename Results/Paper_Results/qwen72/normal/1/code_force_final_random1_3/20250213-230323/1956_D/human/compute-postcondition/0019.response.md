The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called, which means the function will execute with the new parameters `pos + 1` and `r`. This call does not directly change the values of the variables in the current scope, but it initiates a recursive call that will process the sublist from `pos + 1` to `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
- `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
- `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`.
- `pos` is not equal to `r`.
- If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.

After the call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)`, the following remains true:
- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
- `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
- `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`.
- `pos` is not equal to `r`.
- If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
- A recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been initiated.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, `pos` is not equal to `r`, if `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called, and a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been initiated.**
