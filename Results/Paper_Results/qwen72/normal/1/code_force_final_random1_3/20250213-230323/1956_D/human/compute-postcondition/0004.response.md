To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the components of the loop head and their requirements:

- The loop iterates over pairs `(l, r)` from the list `ops`.
- For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one pair.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are values returned by `func_2(a)`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ops`. For the loop to execute, `ops` must be a non-empty list of pairs.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `ops` contains at least one pair.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)`**
