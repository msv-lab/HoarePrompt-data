The only objects in the loop head are the variables `l`, `r`, and the list `ops`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ops`. If there is at least one pair left in `ops`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` had at least one pair remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still have at least one pair remaining, and the next pair `(l, r)` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)` with at least one pair remaining, `l` and `r` are the next pair in `ops`**
