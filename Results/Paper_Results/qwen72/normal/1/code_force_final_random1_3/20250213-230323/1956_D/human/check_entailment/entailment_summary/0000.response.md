### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation up to 5 * 10^5 times where we choose a subarray `a[l:r]`, compute the MEX of this subarray, and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array and provide the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to modify the array `a` and update the operations list `ops` for a specific subarray `a[l:r]`.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
     - If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`.
     - This function ensures that the subarray is modified to maximize the sum by setting elements to the MEX of the subarray.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to process the entire array.
     - It returns a tuple containing the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
     - However, there is a discrepancy in the output hints: it states that `func_2` returns a tuple with the sum of the array, 0, and an empty list, which contradicts the actual implementation.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function recursively processes the subarray `a[l:r]`.
     - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
     - This function ensures that the subarray is processed optimally to maximize the sum.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the sum and operations, and prints the results.
     - It correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` work together to maximize the sum of the array and generate the required operations.
   - The discrepancy in the output hints for `func_2` does not affect the correctness of the program because the actual implementation is correct.
   - The function `func_3` correctly reads the input and prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array and generate the sequence of operations as described in the problem statement.
