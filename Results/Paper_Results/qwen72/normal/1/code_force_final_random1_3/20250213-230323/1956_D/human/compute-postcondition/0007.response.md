To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the context in which the variables `l` and `r` are used.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) is provided by the input and satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)` with at least one pair remaining.

### Understanding the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(l + 1, r + 1)
```
This means we need to determine the values of `l` and `r`.

### Context of `l` and `r`:
- The variables `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they are likely part of the pairs in the `ops` list.
- Since `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs, it suggests that `l` and `r` are indices or positions in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `ops` is a list of pairs and the print statement is using `l` and `r` from these pairs, the most precise description of the output would be:

Output: **(l + 1, r + 1) (where l and r are the indices from the first pair in the ops list)**

This means the print statement will output the indices `l` and `r` from the first pair in the `ops` list, each incremented by 1.
