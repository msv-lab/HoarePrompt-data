### Reasoning

Let's break down the issues and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step.

#### Issue 1: Scope of `ops` in `recursive_maximize_sum`
The original assessment correctly identifies that the `ops` list is not passed to the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. This is indeed a significant issue because `func_1` requires `ops` to be defined in its scope. Without passing `ops`, the function will raise a `NameError`.

#### Issue 2: Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`
The original assessment also points out that the logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not sufficient to ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly. Let's analyze this further:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX operation should find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the segment `[l, r]`. The current logic does not compute the MEX value explicitly. Instead, it sets all elements in the segment to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX value.

2. **Maximizing the Sum**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array. Setting all elements in a segment to `r - l + 1` might not always lead to the maximum possible sum. For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3]`. The MEX of this segment is `0`, but setting all elements to `3` (which is `r - l + 1`) does not increase the sum.

#### Example Input Analysis
Let's consider the example input provided in the original assessment:
```
Input:
3
1 2 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
6 0
```
However, the provided code will not handle this case correctly because it does not compute the MEX value and apply it correctly.

### Corrected Code
To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Pass the `ops` list to `recursive_maximize_sum`.
2. Correctly compute the MEX value and apply it to the segment.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in seen:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        mex_value = mex(a[l:r + 1])
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex_value
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(a, l, pos - 1, ops)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(a, pos + 1, r, ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()
```

### Final Evaluation
Given the issues identified and the corrected code, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the scope issue of `ops` and the flawed logic in computing the MEX value.

Final: **False**
