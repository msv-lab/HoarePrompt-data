### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array `a` using the MEX operation.
   - The MEX operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function handles the MEX operation on a subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if the single element is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
     - If the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray, it performs the MEX operation and updates the subarray.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
     - This function recursively maximizes the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - It calculates the sum of the subarray and compares it to the maximum possible sum `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the current sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, it applies the MEX operation and updates the subarray.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.

   - **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The functions seem to follow the logic required to maximize the sum of the array using the MEX operation.
   - The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the subarrays are processed correctly.
   - The base cases and recursive calls in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are handled appropriately.
   - The operations are stored and printed correctly in `func_3`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `a` and `ops` parameters, which might lead to issues.
   - However, in the context of the provided code, `a` and `ops` are defined in the global scope, so they are accessible within the function. This means that the function can still operate correctly even though the parameters are not explicitly passed.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the potential issue with parameter passing, the overall logic and structure of the functions appear to be correct for solving the problem as described.
   - The program should work correctly given the global scope of `a` and `ops`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program is correct because the functions are logically sound and the global scope of `a` and `ops` allows them to be accessed and modified correctly within the recursive functions. The potential issue with parameter passing does not affect the correctness of the program in this specific context.
