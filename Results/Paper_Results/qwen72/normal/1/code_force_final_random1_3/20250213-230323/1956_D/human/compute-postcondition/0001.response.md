The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `a` is updated to contain the integers read from the input.
- The length of `a` is now determined by the number of integers provided in the input, which should match `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.**
