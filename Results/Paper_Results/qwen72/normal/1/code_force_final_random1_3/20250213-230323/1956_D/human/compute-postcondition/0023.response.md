Functionality: ** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two non-negative integer parameters `l` and `r` such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, where `a` is a list of integers. It modifies the list `a` and appends tuples to the list `ops`. If the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist, it sets all elements in this sublist to the length of the sublist and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. Otherwise, it recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. The function does not return any value. **
