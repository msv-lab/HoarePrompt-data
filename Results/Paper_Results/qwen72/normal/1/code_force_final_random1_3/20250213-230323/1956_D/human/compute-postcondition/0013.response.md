Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value of the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` to the variable `mx`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
