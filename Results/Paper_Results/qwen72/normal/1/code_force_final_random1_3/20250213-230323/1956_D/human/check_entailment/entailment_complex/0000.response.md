Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an array by performing a specific operation no more than 5Â·10^5 times. The key functions and their roles are as follows:

1. **func_1**: This function performs the core operation of setting a segment of the array to the MEX of that segment and appending the operation to the list of operations. It handles both cases where the segment is a single element and where it is a range of elements.

2. **func_2**: This function initializes the process by calling the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array. It then returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations performed, and the list of operations.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum**: This recursive function divides the array into segments and applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum. It checks if the sum of the current segment is less than or equal to the square of the segment's length. If so, it applies the MEX operation; otherwise, it recursively processes the left and right subsegments around the maximum element.

4. **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the required output.

### Analysis:
- **func_1**: The function correctly handles the MEX operation for both single-element and multi-element segments. It ensures that the segment is set to the correct value and appends the operation to the list of operations.
- **func_2**: The function initializes the process and returns the correct results. However, there is a mistake in the function: it calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the `a` and `ops` lists, which are necessary for the function to work correctly.
- **recursive_maximize_sum**: The function correctly divides the array into segments and applies the MEX operation when necessary. It ensures that the sum of the segment is maximized by either applying the MEX operation directly or recursively processing subsegments.
- **func_3**: The function correctly reads the input and prints the output as required.

### Issues:
- **func_2**: The function `func_2` should pass the `a` and `ops` lists to `recursive_maximize_sum` to ensure that the operations are applied correctly. The current implementation does not pass these parameters, which will lead to incorrect behavior.

### Conclusion:
Given the issue in `func_2`, the program is **incorrect** because it does not properly initialize the `ops` list and pass it to the recursive function, leading to potential errors in the operations performed and the final output.

Correctness: **False**
