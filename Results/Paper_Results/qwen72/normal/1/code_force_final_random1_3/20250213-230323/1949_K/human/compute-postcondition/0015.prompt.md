You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements of `numbers`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of the sorted list `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements, and `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements. The sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` respectively, and the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the sorted list `numbers` can be partitioned into three groups such that the sums of the elements in these groups satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) == True`. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of the sorted list `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements, and `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements. The sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` respectively, and the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
