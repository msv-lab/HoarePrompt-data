The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `numbers` after the current `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` must have at least 1 element, and `num` is the first element of `numbers`. For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` will be the second element of `numbers`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a` is `[num]`, `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is `num`, `sum_b` and `sum_c` are 0, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`.**
