The code snippet `numbers.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `numbers` in descending order. This means that the elements of `numbers` will be rearranged from the largest to the smallest.

Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order.**
