To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `power < n`.

Given the state:
- `i` is 2
- `n_cases` is greater than 2
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer
- `power` is 1

The condition for the loop to execute is `power < n`. Since `power` is 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Let's break it down:
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. For `n` to be greater than 1, the input integer must be greater than 2 (since \( \log_2(2) = 1 \) and \( \log_2(4) = 2 \)).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. Given that `n` is already defined as the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, and assuming the input integer is valid (greater than 2), `n` should naturally be greater than 1.

Since `power` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop condition `power < n` will be true, and the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, `power` is 1**
