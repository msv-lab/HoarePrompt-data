Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `n` is not 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.***
