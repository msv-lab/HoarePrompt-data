The code snippet `n = log2(n)` changes the value of `n` to the base-2 logarithm of its current value. Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer, and the conditions around `n` and `power` are specified. However, the specific value of `n` is not given, only that it is an input integer. After applying the `log2` function, `n` will be the logarithm (base 2) of the original `n`.

The conditions about `power` and `n_cases` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the code snippet. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, `power` is 1.**
