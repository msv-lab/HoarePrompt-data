The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 1

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
