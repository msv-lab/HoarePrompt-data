Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The conditions regarding `n` and `power` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The values of `i` and `n_cases` also remain unchanged.
