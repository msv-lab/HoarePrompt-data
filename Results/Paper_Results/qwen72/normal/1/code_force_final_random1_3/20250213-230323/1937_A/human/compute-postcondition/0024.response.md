Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
  - If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`:
    - If `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`.
    - Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the value being printed by the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **1**
