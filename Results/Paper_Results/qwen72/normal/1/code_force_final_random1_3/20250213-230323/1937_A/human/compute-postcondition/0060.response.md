Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the conditions related to `n` and `power` are re-evaluated based on the new value of `n`. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.***
