Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, `power` is equal to `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `power` will be equal to the value of `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. The other variables (`i` and `n_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
