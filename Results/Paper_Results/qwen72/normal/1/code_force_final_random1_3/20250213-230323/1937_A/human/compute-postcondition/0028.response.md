To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `power < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer
- `power` is 1

The condition for the loop to execute is `power < n`. With the current state, `power` is 1. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the given conditions:
- If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then:
  - If `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.

Given that `power` is 1, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, it must be a positive number. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer and must be greater than 1, `power` is 1**
