Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `m` can be greater than `n` or less than `n`, but not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`. If `m` and `n` are both even, the condition `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` holds true. If `m` and `n` are both odd, the condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.***
