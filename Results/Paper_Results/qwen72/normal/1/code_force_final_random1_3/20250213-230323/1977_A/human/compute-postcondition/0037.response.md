The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`. If `m` is greater than `n`, the relationship `m > n` holds true, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than `n` but not equal to `n - 1`, the relationship `m < n` holds true, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.**
