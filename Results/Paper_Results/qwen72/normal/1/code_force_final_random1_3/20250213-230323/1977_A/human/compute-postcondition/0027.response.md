Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`.
- If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`.
- The parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('No')
```

The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
