You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed. `i` is equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, `n` and `m` were integers read from the input. The conditions checked in the loop (whether `n` equals `m`, `m` is greater than `n`, `m` is `n - 1`, or the parity of `n` and `m`) were evaluated for each pair of `n` and `m` read from the input, and the corresponding output ('Yes' or 'No') was printed based on these conditions. The final state of `i` is `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n` and `m` for each iteration are determined by the input provided and do not affect the final value of `i` or `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower.
   - Initially, the tower has 0 cubes.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - If `n == m`, it means we can add `m` cubes in `m` moves, which is straightforward.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means we can add `n-1` cubes and then remove one, which is also straightforward.
   - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it means both `m` and `n` are even, and it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
   - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it means both `m` and `n` are odd, and it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs plus one extra move.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If `n == m`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m > n`, it prints 'No'.
     - If `m == n - 1`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Verification:**
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios:
     - `n == m` is straightforward.
     - `m > n` is impossible.
     - `m == n - 1` is straightforward.
     - `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0` ensures even parity.
     - `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0` ensures odd parity.
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases and logical conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and handles all the specified conditions accurately.
