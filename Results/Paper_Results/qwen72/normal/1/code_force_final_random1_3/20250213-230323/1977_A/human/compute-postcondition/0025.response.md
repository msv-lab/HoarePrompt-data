The provided Python code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `n` and `m` based on the new input. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`. If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`. The parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values read from the input.
- The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, and parity) are still valid based on the new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`. If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`. The parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.**
