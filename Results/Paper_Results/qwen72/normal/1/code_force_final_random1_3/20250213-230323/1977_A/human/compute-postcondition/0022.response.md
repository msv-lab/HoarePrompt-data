Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0. `i` is 0. `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` is greater than `n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`. The parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.***
