The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (t) where each test case involves two integers (n and m). The constraints are that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, 1 <= n, m <= 100.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume that the function processes these test cases and returns some result based on the values of n and m for each test case. Without more specific details on the output, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). It returns a result based on the values of n and m for each test case.**
