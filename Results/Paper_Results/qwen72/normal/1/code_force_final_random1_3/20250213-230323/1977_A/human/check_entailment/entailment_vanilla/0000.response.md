### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower.
   - Initially, the tower has 0 cubes.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - If `n == m`, it means we can add `m` cubes in `m` moves, which is straightforward.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means we can add `n-1` cubes and then remove one, which is also straightforward.
   - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it means both `m` and `n` are even, and it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
   - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it means both `m` and `n` are odd, and it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs plus one extra move.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If `n == m`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m > n`, it prints 'No'.
     - If `m == n - 1`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Verification:**
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios:
     - `n == m` is straightforward.
     - `m > n` is impossible.
     - `m == n - 1` is straightforward.
     - `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0` ensures even parity.
     - `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0` ensures odd parity.
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases and logical conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and handles all the specified conditions accurately.

Correctness: **True**
