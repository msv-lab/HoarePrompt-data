Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0. `i` is 0. `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`. If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`. The parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`. If `m` is greater than `n`, the relationship `m > n` holds true, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than `n` but not equal to `n - 1`, the relationship `m < n` holds true, and the parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` == `m`, the parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values. If `n` != `m`, and `m` > `n`, the parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values. If `m` <= `n` and `m` equals `n - 1` or either `n` or `m` is odd, the program takes no additional action.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
