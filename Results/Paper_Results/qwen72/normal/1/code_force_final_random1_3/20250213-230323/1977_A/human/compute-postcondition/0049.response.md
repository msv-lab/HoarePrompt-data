Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` == `m`, the parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values. If `n` != `m`, and `m` > `n`, the parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values. If `m` <= `n` and `m` equals `n - 1` or either `n` or `m` is odd, the program takes no additional action.***
