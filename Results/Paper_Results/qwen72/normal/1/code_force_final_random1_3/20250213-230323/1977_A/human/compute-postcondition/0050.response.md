Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed. `i` is equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, `n` and `m` were integers read from the input. The conditions checked in the loop (whether `n` equals `m`, `m` is greater than `n`, `m` is `n - 1`, or the parity of `n` and `m`) were evaluated for each pair of `n` and `m` read from the input, and the corresponding output ('Yes' or 'No') was printed based on these conditions. The final state of `i` is `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n` and `m` for each iteration are determined by the input provided and do not affect the final value of `i` or `t`.**
