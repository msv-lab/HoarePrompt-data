The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 1. `i` is 1. `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` or less than `n`. If `m` is less than `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1` unless `m` is exactly one less than `n`, in which case `m` is `n - 1`. The parity (even or odd) of `m` and `n` remains unchanged.**
