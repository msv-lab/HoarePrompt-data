The code snippet `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a space-separated string from the user input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user
- `n` is the first element of `feat`
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`

After executing the code snippet, the new state is:

- `i` is 0
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user
- `n` is the first element of `feat`
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user

Output State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.**
