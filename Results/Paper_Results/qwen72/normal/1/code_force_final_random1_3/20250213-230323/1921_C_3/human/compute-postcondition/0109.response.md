Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Conditions:
- If `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`.
- For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
- Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
- Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('No')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'No'`.
- The conditions described in the initial state and the logic for populating `array2` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the print statement does not depend on any of these conditions or variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **No**
