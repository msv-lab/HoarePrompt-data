Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, along with the moments at which messages need to be sent. For each test case, it determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge required (considering both continuous usage and turning the phone off and on) is less than the initial charge, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
