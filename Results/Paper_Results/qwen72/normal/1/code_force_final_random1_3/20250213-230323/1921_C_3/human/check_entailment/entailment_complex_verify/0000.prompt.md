You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n, f, a, b are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, respectively. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `test_cases` is the number of test cases provided initially, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user for each test case, `n` is the first element of `feat` for the last test case, `f` is the second element of `feat` for the last test case, `a` is the third element of `feat` for the last test case, `b` is the last element of `feat` for the last test case, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user for the last test case, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true for the last test case. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f` for the last test case, then "Yes" is printed. Otherwise, "No" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, along with the moments at which messages need to be sent. For each test case, it determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge required (considering both continuous usage and turning the phone off and on) is less than the initial charge, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the initial charge consumption from moment 0 to the first message moment. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Charge Consumption**: The program does not account for the charge consumed from moment 0 to the first message moment. This can lead to incorrect results if the initial charge is not sufficient to reach the first message moment.

2. **Charge Calculation for Intervals**: The program calculates the charge consumption for intervals between messages but does not correctly handle the initial interval from 0 to the first message moment.

3. **Edge Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1 3 1 5
   3
   ```
   - Initial charge \( f = 3 \)
   - Charge consumption per unit time \( a = 1 \)
   - Charge consumption for turning off and on \( b = 5 \)
   - Message at moment \( m_1 = 3 \)

   The program will incorrectly output "Yes" because it does not account for the initial charge consumption from moment 0 to moment 3. The correct output should be "No" because the phone will run out of charge before reaching moment 3.

To fix this, the program should include the initial charge consumption from moment 0 to the first message moment in its calculations.
