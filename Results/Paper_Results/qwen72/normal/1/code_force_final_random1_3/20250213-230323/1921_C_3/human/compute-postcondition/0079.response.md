Output State: **`feat` is updated to a list of integers input by the user, `i` is no longer `n`, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `n` must be less than `test_cases`.** 

The code `b = feat[-1]` updates the variable `b` to be the last element of the `feat` list. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
