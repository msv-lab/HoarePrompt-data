Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if Stepan can send all messages without his phone's charge dropping to zero or below. The logic involves calculating the total charge required to send all messages, considering both the continuous usage and the cost of turning the phone off and on.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - It calculates the charge required for sending messages continuously between two consecutive message times (`array2`).
   - It also considers the charge required for turning the phone off and on (`b`).
3. **Decision Making**:
   - The program sums up the charge required for continuous usage and the charge required for turning the phone off and on.
   - If the total charge required is less than the initial charge (`f`), it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Continuous Usage**:
   - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` is used to decide whether to add the charge for continuous usage. This condition is incorrect because it should consider the charge required for continuous usage regardless of whether it is less than `b / a`.
2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of `array2` should include the charge for continuous usage for all intervals, not just those where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
3. **Charge for Turning Off and On**:
   - The charge for turning the phone off and on should be considered for each interval, not just the intervals where the charge for continuous usage is less than `b / a`.

To fix these issues, the program should calculate the total charge required for continuous usage and the charge for turning the phone off and on separately and then sum them up.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total charge required for continuous usage
        continuous_charge = (arr[-1] - arr[0]) * a
        
        # Calculate the total charge required for turning the phone off and on
        turn_charge = (n - 1) * b
        
        # Total charge required
        total_charge = continuous_charge + turn_charge
        
        # Check if the total charge required is less than or equal to the initial charge
        if total_charge <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Continuous Charge Calculation**:
   - The total charge required for continuous usage is calculated as `(arr[-1] - arr[0]) * a`, which is the charge consumed from the first message to the last message.
2. **Turn Charge Calculation**:
   - The total charge required for turning the phone off and on is calculated as `(n - 1) * b`, which is the charge consumed for turning the phone off and on between each pair of consecutive messages.
3. **Total Charge Calculation**:
   - The total charge required is the sum of the continuous charge and the turn charge.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - If the total charge required is less than or equal to the initial charge, the program prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the corrected program, the original program is **incorrect** due to the issues mentioned.

Correctness: **False**
