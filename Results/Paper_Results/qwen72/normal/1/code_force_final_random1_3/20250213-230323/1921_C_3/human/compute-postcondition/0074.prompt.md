Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n, f, a, b are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, respectively. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is less than `b / a`. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
