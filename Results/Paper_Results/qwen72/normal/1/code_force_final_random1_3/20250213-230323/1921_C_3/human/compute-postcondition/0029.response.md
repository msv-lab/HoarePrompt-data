Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` is updated to be the third element of the list `feat`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `b`, `test_cases`, `arr`, and `array2`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `array2` remains the same, using the updated value of `a`.
