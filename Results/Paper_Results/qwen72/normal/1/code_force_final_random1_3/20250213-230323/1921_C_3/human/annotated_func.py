#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n, f, a, b are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, respectively. m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `test_cases` is the number of test cases provided initially, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user for each test case, `n` is the first element of `feat` for the last test case, `f` is the second element of `feat` for the last test case, `a` is the third element of `feat` for the last test case, `b` is the last element of `feat` for the last test case, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user for the last test case, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true for the last test case. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f` for the last test case, then "Yes" is printed. Otherwise, "No" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge consumption per unit of time, and charge consumption for turning the phone off and on, along with the moments at which messages need to be sent. For each test case, it determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge required (considering both continuous usage and turning the phone off and on) is less than the initial charge, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
