The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2]`, depending on whether the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`.**
