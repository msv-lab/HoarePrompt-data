Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is either an empty list or `[ (arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2] ]` depending on whether the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.***
