The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list of integers `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. Here, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of messages. `f` is an integer where 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9, representing the initial phone charge. `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the charge loss per unit time and the charge loss for turning the phone on and off, respectively. The list `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the minimum total charge loss required to send all messages for each test case, considering the initial charge and the charge losses for both time and turning the phone on and off.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge loss per unit time, charge loss for turning the phone on and off, and the moments at which messages need to be sent. It returns the minimum total charge loss required to send all messages for each test case.**
