Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `test_cases` is greater than 0.
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
  - `n` is the first element of `feat`.
  - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
  - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
  - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `array2` is a list that contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

Given the `print('No')` statement, the output is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
