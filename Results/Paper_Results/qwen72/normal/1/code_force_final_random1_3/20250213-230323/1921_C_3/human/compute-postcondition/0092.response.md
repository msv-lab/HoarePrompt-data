The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 1, if `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, then `array2` remains an empty list.**
