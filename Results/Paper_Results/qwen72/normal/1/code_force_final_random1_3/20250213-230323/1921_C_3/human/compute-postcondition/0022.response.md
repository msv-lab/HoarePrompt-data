Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.***
