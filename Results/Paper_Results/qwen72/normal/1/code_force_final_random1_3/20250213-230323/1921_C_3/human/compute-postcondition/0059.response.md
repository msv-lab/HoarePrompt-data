The code snippet `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)` modifies the `array2` list by appending a new value calculated from the elements of `arr` and the variable `a`. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is 1, so `arr[i]` refers to the second element of `arr`.
- `arr[i - 1]` refers to the first element of `arr`.
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is `(arr[1] - arr[0])`.
- This difference is then multiplied by `a`, which is `feat[2]`.
- The result of this calculation is appended to `array2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `test_cases` is greater than `n`.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `array2` is an empty list.
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.

After executing the code:
- `array2` now contains one element, which is the result of `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is `[ (arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2] ]`, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.**
