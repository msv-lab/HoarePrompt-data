You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` has been an input integer for each iteration, `a` has been a new list of integers provided by the user for each iteration, and `year` has been calculated as the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in the list `a` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a number of signs and their periodicities. It returns the result for each test case based on the provided periodicities.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
