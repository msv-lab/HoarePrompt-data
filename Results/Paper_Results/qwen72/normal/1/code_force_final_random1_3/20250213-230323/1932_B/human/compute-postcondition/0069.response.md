The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`. Here, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` corresponds to the final value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`. The final value of `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in the list `a` for that test case, which is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0).

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates the smallest multiple of the last periodicity that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of all periodicities, starting from an initial year of 0. It returns a list of these calculated years for each test case.**
