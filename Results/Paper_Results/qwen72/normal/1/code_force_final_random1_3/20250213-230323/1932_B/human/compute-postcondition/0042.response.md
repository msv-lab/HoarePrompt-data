The code snippet `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to be the same as `next_year`. This means that `current_year` now holds the value that was previously assigned to `next_year`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements.
- `current_year` is updated based on the last element of `a`.
- `ai` is the next element in `a`.
- If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`.
- Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `current_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`.

Output State: **`a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `current_year` is equal to the value of `next_year` (which was calculated based on the conditions given), and `ai` is the next element in `a`.**
