Output State: **`current_year` is 0, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test`, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above.**

Explanation:
- The code sets `current_year` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- `test_cases` must still have at least one more element.
- `test` is still the next element in `test_cases`.
- `results` now includes `current_year` (which is 0) as its last element.
- `n` is still the first element of the tuple `test`.
- `a` is still the second element of the tuple `test`.
- `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above.
