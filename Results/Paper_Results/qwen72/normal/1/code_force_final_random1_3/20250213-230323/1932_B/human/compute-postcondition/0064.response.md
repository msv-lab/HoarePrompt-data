Output State: **`current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one more element, `ai` is the next element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is now `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is now equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation:
- The line `current_year = next_year` updates the value of `current_year` to be the same as `next_year`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` are still valid as described in the initial state.
- The logic for updating `next_year` based on the condition `current_year % ai == 0` remains the same, but since `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, the condition and subsequent calculation for `next_year` will be based on the new value of `current_year`.
