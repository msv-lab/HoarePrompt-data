Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) such that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements that must have at least 1 element, `test` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be an iterable with at least 1 element, `current_year` is the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop, where `next_year` is updated for each element `ai` in `a` such that if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`; otherwise, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `current_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0). The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged. `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is now equal to the final value of `next_year` after all iterations of the loop, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element and the current `current_year` as its new last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `ai` is the last element of `a` that was processed. If the final `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` was set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was set to the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the final `current_year`. The state of `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remains unchanged except for the changes mentioned above.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
