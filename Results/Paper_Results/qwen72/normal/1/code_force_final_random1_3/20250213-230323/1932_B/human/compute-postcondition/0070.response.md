Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), representing the periodicities of signs. For each test case, the function calculates the smallest multiple of the last periodicity in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each periodicity in `a`, starting from an initial year of 0. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the calculated year for the corresponding test case. The original values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. **
