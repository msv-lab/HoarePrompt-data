The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new integer input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `year`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least `n` elements, `year` is the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in the list `a`.**
