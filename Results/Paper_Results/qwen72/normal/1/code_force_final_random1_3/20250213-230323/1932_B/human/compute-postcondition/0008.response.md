Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is updated to `year + (year % ai or ai)`, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `year` is updated to `year + (year % ai or ai)`.
- If `year % ai` is non-zero, `year` is incremented by `year % ai`.
- If `year % ai` is zero, `year` is incremented by `ai`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `ai`) remain unchanged.
