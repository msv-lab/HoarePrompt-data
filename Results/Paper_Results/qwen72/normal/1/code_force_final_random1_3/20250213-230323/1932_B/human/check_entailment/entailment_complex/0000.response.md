Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem statement. The key logic in the program is the loop that iterates over the periodicities of the signs and updates the `year` variable accordingly. The expression `year += year % ai or ai` is used to update the year. This expression works as follows:

- `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If `year` is a multiple of `ai`, this will be 0.
- `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai` if it is non-zero (i.e., `year` is not a multiple of `ai`), otherwise it evaluates to `ai`.
- Adding this result to `year` ensures that `year` is updated to the next occurrence of the sign, strictly after the previous sign's occurrence.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic. The expression `year += year % ai or ai` does not correctly handle the case where `year` is already a multiple of `ai`. In such a case, `year % ai` is 0, and `year += 0` does not change `year`. Instead, `year` should be incremented by `ai` to move to the next occurrence of the sign.

To fix this, the correct logic should be:
```python
year += ai - (year % ai) if year % ai != 0 else ai
```

This ensures that if `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it is incremented by `ai` to move to the next occurrence. If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, it is incremented by the difference between `ai` and the remainder of `year % ai`.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct results for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
