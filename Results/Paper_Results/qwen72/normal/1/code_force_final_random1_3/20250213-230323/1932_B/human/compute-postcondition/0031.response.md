The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `ai` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is now equal to `ai`, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**
