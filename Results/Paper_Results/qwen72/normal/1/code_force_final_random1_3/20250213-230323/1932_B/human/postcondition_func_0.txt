The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their periodicities. For each test case, it calculates a specific value (`year`) based on the periodicities and prints this value. The function does not return any values; instead, it outputs the results directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
