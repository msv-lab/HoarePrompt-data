Output State: **`current_year` is 0, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.**

Explanation:
- `current_year` is 0.
- `ai` is the first element of `a`.
- `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0, meaning `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`.
- `next_year` is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which finds the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
