The code snippet `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)` appends a new element to `array2`. This element is calculated as the difference between the second and first elements of `arr`, multiplied by `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.
- If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, then `array2` remains an empty list.

The code appends `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` to `array2`. Since `i` is 1, the condition `i == 1` is satisfied, and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is calculated and then multiplied by `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 1, `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.**
