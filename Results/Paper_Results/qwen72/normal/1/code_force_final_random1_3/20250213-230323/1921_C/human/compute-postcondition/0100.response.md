The code `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` appends the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` to `array2`.

- `feat` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2.
- `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list.
- `arr` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
- `i` is 2.
- `array2` now contains the value `arr[0] * a`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 2, `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`.**
