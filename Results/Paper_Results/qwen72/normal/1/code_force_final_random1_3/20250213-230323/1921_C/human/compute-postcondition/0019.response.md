Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
- The variable `n` will still be greater than 0.
- The variable `test_cases` will still be greater than 0.
- The list `feat` will remain unchanged, with `n` as the first element, `f` as the second element, `a` as the third element, and `b` as the last element.
- The list `arr` will remain unchanged as the list of integers input by the user.
- The list `array2` will contain the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each index `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is satisfied. If no such conditions are met, `array2` will remain an empty list.
