Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.***
