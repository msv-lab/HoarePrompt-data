Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `array2` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `test_cases`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition involving `array2` and the sum of its elements is not evaluated because `array2` is just initialized and no operations are performed on it yet.
