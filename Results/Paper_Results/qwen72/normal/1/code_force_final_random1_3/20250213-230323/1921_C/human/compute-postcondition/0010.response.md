Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list, and the difference between the second element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.**
