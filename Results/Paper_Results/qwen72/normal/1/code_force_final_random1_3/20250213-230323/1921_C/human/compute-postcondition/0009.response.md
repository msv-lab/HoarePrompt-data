The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). The variable `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list**
