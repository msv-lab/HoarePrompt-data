Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If the difference between `arr[3]` and `arr[2]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]` in addition to its previous elements. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.***
