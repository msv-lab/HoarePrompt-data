The code appends a new value to `array2` which is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to appending `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]` to `array2`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `i` remains 3.
- `n` remains greater than 3.
- `f` remains `feat[1]`.
- `a` remains `feat[2]`.
- `b` remains `feat[-1]`.
- `test_cases` remains greater than `n`.
- `arr` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `array2` now includes the value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is either an empty list or `[ (arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2] ]` depending on whether the difference between the second element and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If `arr[2] - arr[1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` includes the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`. Additionally, `array2` now includes the value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]`.**
