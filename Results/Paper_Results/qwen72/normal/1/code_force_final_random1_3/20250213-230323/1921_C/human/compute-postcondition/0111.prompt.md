Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, initial phone charge, charge loss per unit time, and charge loss for turning the phone on and off, respectively. `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` are integers where 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the first element of `feat` and is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user with at least one element, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each valid `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is appended to `array2`. For each subsequent `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`. The final state of `array2` will depend on how many times these conditions were met during the loop's execution. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]` and is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user with at least one element, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `n` must be less than `test_cases`. Specifically, `array2` will contain the value `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`, and for each subsequent index `i` where `0 < i < n`, it will contain the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If these conditions are not met, the corresponding values will not be added to `array2`. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the specific action for the if part is taken. Otherwise, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`, then the specific action for the else part is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
