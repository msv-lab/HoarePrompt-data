The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (thus `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is a list. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains two elements: the first element is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2]`, and the second element is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`. Otherwise, `array2` contains one element: `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`.**
