To determine what will be printed when the `print('Yes')` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is `feat[0]`.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `test_cases` is greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` must be true for elements to be included in `array2`.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` must be less than `f`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute if all the conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated and must be true for the code to reach the `print` statement, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
