### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
   - It also correctly reads the list of moments `arr` when messages need to be sent.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumed between consecutive messages if the phone is kept on.
   - It iterates through the list of moments `arr` starting from the second element.
   - For each pair of consecutive moments, it checks if the time difference `arr[i] - arr[i-1]` is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends the charge consumed during this interval to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total charge consumed by summing the elements in `array2` and adding the charge consumed by turning the phone on and off for the remaining intervals.
   - The charge consumed by turning the phone on and off for the remaining intervals is `(n - len(array2)) * b`.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The function compares the total charge consumed with the initial charge `f`.
   - If the total charge consumed is less than or equal to `f`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for Charge Consumption**:
  - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is indeed incorrect. It should be `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > b / a` because if the time difference is greater than `b / a`, it is more efficient to keep the phone on rather than turning it off and on.
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum of `array2` should represent the charge consumed when the phone is kept on. However, the current implementation incorrectly sums the charge consumed for intervals where the phone should be turned off and on.
- **Incorrect Final Comparison**:
  - The final comparison should consider the total charge consumed correctly, including the charge consumed by turning the phone on and off for the remaining intervals.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the total charge consumed
        total_charge_consumed = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                total_charge_consumed += arr[i] * a
            else:
                if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > b / a:
                    total_charge_consumed += (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
                else:
                    total_charge_consumed += b
        
        # Check if the total charge consumed is within the initial charge
        if total_charge_consumed <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Correctness:
The original program has logical errors in the conditions and calculations, leading to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.

Final: **False**
