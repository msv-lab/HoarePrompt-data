Postcondition: ***`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 2. If `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.***
