The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be at least 3 for the loop condition to hold.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `j` is 3.**
