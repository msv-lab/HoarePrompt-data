To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `nx` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `xx[3]` (from index 0 to `n-1`), where:
     - Each character is the corresponding character from `xx[3]` if it is not '?'.
     - If the character is '?':
       - It becomes 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.
       - It becomes 'S' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is `n + 1`, so `j` ranges from 3 to 25 depending on the value of `n`.
   - `sa` is not explicitly defined, but it is implied to be a list or array of some sort. The "first quarter" of `sa` would be the indices from 0 to `len(sa) // 4 - 1`.

3. **Forming the String `nx`:**
   - We need to form `nx` by iterating over the first `n` characters of `xx[3]`.
   - For each character in `xx[3]`:
     - If the character is not '?', it remains unchanged.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if `i` (which is 3) or `j` (which is `n + 1`) is in the first quarter of `sa`.
       - If either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter, replace '?' with 'F'.
       - Otherwise, replace '?' with 'S'.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `xx[3]` is a string like "a?b?c?d?e?f?g?h?i?j?k?l?m?n?o?p?q?r?s?t?u?v?w?x?y?z?".
   - Let's assume `n` is 10, so `j` is 11.
   - Let's assume `sa` is a list of length 24, so the first quarter is indices 0 to 5.

   - For `i = 3` and `j = 11`, both are in the first quarter of `sa` (assuming `sa` has indices 0 to 5 in the first quarter).

   - Forming `nx`:
     - `xx[3][0]` is 'a' → 'a'
     - `xx[3][1]` is '?' → 'F' (since `i` is in the first quarter)
     - `xx[3][2]` is 'b' → 'b'
     - `xx[3][3]` is '?' → 'F' (since `i` is in the first quarter)
     - `xx[3][4]` is 'c' → 'c'
     - `xx[3][5]` is '?' → 'F' (since `i` is in the first quarter)
     - `xx[3][6]` is 'd' → 'd'
     - `xx[3][7]` is '?' → 'F' (since `i` is in the first quarter)
     - `xx[3][8]` is 'e' → 'e'
     - `xx[3][9]` is '?' → 'F' (since `i` is in the first quarter)

   - Therefore, `nx` would be "aFbFcFdFeF".

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact output depends on the specific values of `xx[3]`, `n`, and `sa`, but the general form is clear.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string formed by concatenating characters from xx[3] from index 0 to n-1, replacing '?' with 'F' if i or j is in the first quarter of sa, and 'S' otherwise)**
