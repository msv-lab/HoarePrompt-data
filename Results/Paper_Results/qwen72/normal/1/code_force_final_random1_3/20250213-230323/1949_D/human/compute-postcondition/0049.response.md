Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `x` is the new input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', `b[2]` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the list `b` remains unchanged. If the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'S', the list `b` remains unchanged.***
