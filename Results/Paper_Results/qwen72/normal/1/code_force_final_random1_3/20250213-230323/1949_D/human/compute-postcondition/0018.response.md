The value at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. Since `j` starts at 2 and increments up to `n + 1`, the value at index `j` in the list `a` is now one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`, the value at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1.**
