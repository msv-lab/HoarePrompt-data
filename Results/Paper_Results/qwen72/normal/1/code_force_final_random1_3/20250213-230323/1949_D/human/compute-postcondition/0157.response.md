Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, and the character at position `i` and `j-1` (i.e., `xx[2][0]`) in the array `xx` is `?`. If either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
