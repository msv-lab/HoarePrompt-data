Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then `sb` includes the index `i`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, `nx` will contain the final concatenated string based on the rules specified in the loop, and the other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) will remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is the concatenation of characters from `xx[i]` where each character is either the corresponding character from `xx[i]` if it is not '?', or 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is a string constructed by iterating over the characters in `xx[i]` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character, if it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If it is '?', and `i` or the current index (plus 1) is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`. `i` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
