The code snippet `nx += 'S'` attempts to concatenate the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which means this operation would raise a `NameError` because `nx` does not exist.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, and a `NameError` occurs because `nx` is not defined.**
