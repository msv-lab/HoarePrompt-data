Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings. The lists `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`. `sa` now contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. For any index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `i` is appended to `sa`. The length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined as follows: For each index `k` from 0 to `n-1`, if the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then the character at position `k` in `nx` is the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx`. If the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx` is '?', then the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'F' if either `i` (1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is a string that has been constructed by iterating through the characters of `xx[2]` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character at index `k` (where `0 ≤ k < n`), if the character is not `'?'`, it is appended to `nx`. If the character is `'?'`, and if `i` or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `'F'` is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, `'S'` is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `xx[3]` (from index 0 to `n-1`), where each character is either the corresponding character from `xx[3]` if it is not '?', 'F' if the character is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, or 'S' if the character is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
