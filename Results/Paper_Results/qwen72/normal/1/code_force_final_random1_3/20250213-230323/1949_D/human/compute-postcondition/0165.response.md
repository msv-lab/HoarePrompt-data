The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 3), and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `j`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3**
