Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If the character at position 0 of the string `xx[3]` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position 0 of the string `xx[3]`. If the character at position 0 of the string `xx[3]` is '?', and if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
