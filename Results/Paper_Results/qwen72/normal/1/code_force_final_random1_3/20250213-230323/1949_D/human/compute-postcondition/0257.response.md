The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop condition is `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged.**
