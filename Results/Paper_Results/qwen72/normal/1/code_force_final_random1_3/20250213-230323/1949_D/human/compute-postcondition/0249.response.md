Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is '?'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.***
