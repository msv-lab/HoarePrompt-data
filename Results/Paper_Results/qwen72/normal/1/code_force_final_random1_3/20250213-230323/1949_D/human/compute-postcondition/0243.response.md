Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is now the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]`, `i` is 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, and the character at position `i-1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?'**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j - 1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` (which is `xx[1]`) to the string `nx`.
- Initially, `nx` was an empty string, so after the execution, `nx` contains the character at position 0 in `xx[1]`.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that the character at position `i-1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?' remains valid.
