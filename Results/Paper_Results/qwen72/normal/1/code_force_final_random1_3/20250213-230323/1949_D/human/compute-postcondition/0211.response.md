Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `a[3]` and `b[3]` are both 0, then `sb` includes the index 3. If `a[2]` and `b[2]` are both 0, then `sb` includes the index 2.***
