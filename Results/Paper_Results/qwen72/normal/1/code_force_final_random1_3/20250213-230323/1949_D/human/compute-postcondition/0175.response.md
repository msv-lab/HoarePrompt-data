The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since `n` is given as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, the loop will definitely execute at least once. However, the initial value of `j` in the loop head should be 1 for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` starts at 1, and `n` must be within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 24) to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string**
