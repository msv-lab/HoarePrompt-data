To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- After the loop has executed all iterations:
  - `j` will be `n + 1`.
  - `nx` will contain the final concatenated string based on the rules specified in the loop.
  - The other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) will remain unchanged.

### Explanation:
- The key variable here is `nx`, which is described as the final concatenated string based on the rules specified in the loop.
- Since the exact rules of the loop are not provided, we can only infer that `nx` is the result of some concatenation process that occurs within the loop.
- The final value of `nx` is determined by the concatenation logic applied during the loop iterations.

### Output:
The `print(nx)` statement will print the final concatenated string `nx` that was constructed during the loop iterations.
Output: **nx (where nx is the final concatenated string based on the rules specified in the loop)**
