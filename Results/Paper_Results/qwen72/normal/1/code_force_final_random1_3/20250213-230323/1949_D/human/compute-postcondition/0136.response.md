The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. To determine the exact value of `nx` before this operation, we need to consider the conditions given in the initial state.

- If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx`.
- If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is '?', then:
  - `nx` is 'F' if either `i` (which is 1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` (which is 2) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
  - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

After appending 'S' to `nx`, the new value of `nx` will be:

- If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` will be the original character followed by 'S'.
- If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is '?':
  - If either `i` (1) or `j` (2) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` will be 'FS'.
  - Otherwise, `nx` will be 'SS'.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` followed by 'S'.** 

- If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` followed by 'S'.
- If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is '?':
  - If either `i` (1) or `j` (2) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'FS'.
  - Otherwise, `nx` is 'SS'.
