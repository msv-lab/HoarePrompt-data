Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[3][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[3][1]`. If `xx[3][1]` is equal to '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, a `NameError` is raised because `nx` is undefined. Otherwise, an error occurs because `nx` is not defined, and attempting to perform an operation on an undefined variable raises a `NameError`.***
