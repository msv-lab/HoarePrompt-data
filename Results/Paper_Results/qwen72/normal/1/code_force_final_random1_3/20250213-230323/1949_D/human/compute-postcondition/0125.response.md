Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `nx` is the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx`, `j` is 1, and the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx` is not '?'**. 

This means that the string `nx` now contains the character located at the position `[1][0]` in the array `xx`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
