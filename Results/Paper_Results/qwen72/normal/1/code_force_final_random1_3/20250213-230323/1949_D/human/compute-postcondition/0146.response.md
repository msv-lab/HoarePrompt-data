To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct the string `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the following rules:
  - For each index `k` from 0 to `n-1`:
    - If the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then the character at position `k` in `nx` is the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx`.
    - If the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx` is '?', then:
      - The character at position `k` in `nx` is 'F' if either `i` (which is 1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
      - Otherwise, the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'S'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `nx`:**
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`.

2. **Construct `nx` Based on the Rules:**
   - For each index `k` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Check the character at position `[1][k]` in the array `xx`.
     - If it is not '?', use that character.
     - If it is '?':
       - Check if `i` (which is 1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
       - Check if `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
       - If either condition is true, use 'F'.
       - Otherwise, use 'S'.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - Since `i` is 1, it is always in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` (assuming `sa` is a list of integers starting from 1).
   - Therefore, if the character at position `[1][k]` in `xx` is '?', the character at position `k` in `nx` will be 'F'.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the construction rules, the string `nx` will be composed of characters from `xx` where they are not '?'. For positions where `xx` contains '?', the character in `nx` will be 'F' because `i` (1) is always in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n, with characters from xx where they are not '?', and 'F' where they are '?')**
