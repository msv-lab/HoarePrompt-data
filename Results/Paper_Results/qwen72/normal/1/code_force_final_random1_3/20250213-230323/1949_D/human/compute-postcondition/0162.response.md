The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` is determined based on conditions involving `xx[2]`, `i`, and `j`, and these conditions are not specified, we cannot determine the exact initial value of `nx`. However, we know that after the code executes, `nx` will have an additional 'S' appended to its current value.

The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
