The code snippet `nx += 'S'` attempts to concatenate the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. However, there is no initial state provided for `nx`, which means `nx` is undefined. In Python, attempting to perform an operation on an undefined variable will raise a `NameError`.

Since the code will raise an error, the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, and a `NameError` is raised because `nx` is undefined.**
