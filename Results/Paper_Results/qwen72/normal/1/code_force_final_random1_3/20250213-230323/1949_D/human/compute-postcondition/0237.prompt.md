Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then `sb` includes the index `i`. `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then `sb` includes the index `i`. If the character at position `j-1` in the string `xx[i]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is set to this character. If the character at position `j-1` in the string `xx[i]` is '?', then `nx` is set to 'S' if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 2. If `xx[i][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `'F'`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to `nx + 'S'`. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to `nx + 'F'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
