The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since `n` is already given as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, the loop will definitely execute at least once. The variable `j` needs to be initialized to 1 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `j` is 1 and `n` is within the specified range.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1**
