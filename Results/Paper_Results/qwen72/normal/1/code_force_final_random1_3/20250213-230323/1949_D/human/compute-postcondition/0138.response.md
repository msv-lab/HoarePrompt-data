Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, and `nx` is determined as follows: If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` concatenated with itself. If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` (1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` (2) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
