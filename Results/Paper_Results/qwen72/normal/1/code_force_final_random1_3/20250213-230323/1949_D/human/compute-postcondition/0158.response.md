Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If the character at position 0 of `xx[2]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is the string containing this character. If the character at position 0 of `xx[2]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
