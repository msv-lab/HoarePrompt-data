Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged.
- The variables `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.
- The variable `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][1]` to its current value. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` equals 1, so the value at `xx[i][1]` is added to `nx`.
