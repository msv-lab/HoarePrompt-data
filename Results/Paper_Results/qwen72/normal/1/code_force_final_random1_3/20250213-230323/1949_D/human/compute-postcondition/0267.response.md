To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n + 1)` contains at least one element.
   - For `range(1, n + 1)` to contain at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The initial state given is:
     - `j` is `n + 1`
     - `n` remains unchanged
     - `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged
     - `nx` is an empty string
     - `i` is `n + 1`
   - To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `j` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` should be 1 (the starting value of the loop).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`**
