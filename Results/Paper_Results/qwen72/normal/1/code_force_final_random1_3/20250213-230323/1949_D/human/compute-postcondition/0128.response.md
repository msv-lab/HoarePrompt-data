Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, and the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in `xx` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`, which was initially an empty string. Therefore, `nx` now contains the single character 'F'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
