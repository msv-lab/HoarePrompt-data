Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `x` is the new input string. If the character at index 2 (i.e., `x[j - 1]`) of `x` is 'F', `a[3]` is incremented by 1, and `b` remains unchanged. If the character at index 2 of `x` is 'S', `b[2]` and `b[3]` are each incremented by 1, while `a` remains unchanged. If the character at index 2 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
