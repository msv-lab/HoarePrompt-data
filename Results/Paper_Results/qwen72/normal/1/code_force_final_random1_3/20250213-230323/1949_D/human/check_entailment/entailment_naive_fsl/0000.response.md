Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not ensure that the transition videos do not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type consecutively for every permutation of scenarios. The program attempts to balance the distribution of 'F' and 'S' by categorizing scenarios into `sa` and `sb` lists, but it does not guarantee that the constraint is met for all permutations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```
The program might output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
F.FFF
FFFF.
```
However, if the player follows the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, S, F`. This sequence has 3 consecutive 'F' videos, which is within the allowed limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\). However, if the player follows the permutation [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], the sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, F, S`, which also has 3 consecutive 'F' videos. 

The issue arises when considering other permutations. For example, if the player follows the permutation [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], the sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, F, S`, which again has 3 consecutive 'F' videos. However, if the player follows the permutation [1, 2, 4, 3, 5], the sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, F, F`, which has 4 consecutive 'F' videos, violating the constraint.

Thus, the program does not ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations, making it incorrect.
