To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct the string `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged
- `nx` is a string constructed by iterating over the characters in `xx[i]` from index 0 to `n-1`.
  - For each character:
    - If it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`.
    - If it is '?':
      - And `i` or the current index (plus 1) is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
      - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
- `i` is `n + 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the value of `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged, so we need to know its value from the context. However, since `i` is `n + 1`, we can infer that `i` is one more than `n`.

3. **Construct the string `nx`:**
   - We iterate over the characters in `xx[i]` from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `xx` has at least `n + 1` elements.
   - For each character in `xx[i]`:
     - If the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if `i` or the current index (plus 1) is in the first quarter of `sb`.
         - If true, append 'S' to `nx`.
         - Otherwise, append 'F' to `nx`.

4. **Determine the first quarter of `sb`:**
   - The first quarter of `sb` is the range from 0 to `len(sb) // 4 - 1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for clarity:
- `n = 5`
- `i = n + 1 = 6`
- `xx = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z?def", "ghijk"]`
- `sb = "1234567890"`

#### Constructing `nx`:
- `xx[i]` is `xx[6]`, which is `"ghijk"`.
- Iterate over `ghijk` from index 0 to `n-1` (which is 0 to 4):
  - `g` is not '?', so append 'g' to `nx`.
  - `h` is not '?', so append 'h' to `nx`.
  - `i` is not '?', so append 'i' to `nx`.
  - `j` is not '?', so append 'j' to `nx`.
  - `k` is not '?', so append 'k' to `nx`.

Thus, `nx` will be `"ghijk"`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ghijk** (where `xx[6]` is `"ghijk"` and no '?' characters are present, so no replacements are made).
