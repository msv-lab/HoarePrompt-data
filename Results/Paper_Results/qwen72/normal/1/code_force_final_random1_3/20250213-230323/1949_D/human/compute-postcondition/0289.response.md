Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is a string constructed by iterating over the characters in `xx[i]` from index 0 to `n-1`. For each character, if it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If it is '?', and `i` or the current index (plus 1) is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`. `i` is `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1`.
- The variable `nx` is built by appending characters based on the conditions inside the loop:
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is appended to `nx`.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
- The variables `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `i` remains `n + 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
