Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and specifically, `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
- `m` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d2` Initialization**:
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - The values of `x` and `y` can be any integers, but they are not constrained by the initial state.

3. **Behavior of `d2`**:
   - If `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is any other value, `d2[y]` will be 0 (since the default value of `d2` is 0).
   - Similarly, if `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is any other value, `d2[x]` will be 0.

4. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(1 - 0 = 1\).
   - If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(0 - 1 = -1\).
   - If both `y` and `x` are equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(1 - 1 = 0\).
   - If both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(0 - 0 = 0\).

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will depend on the values of `x` and `y` relative to `n - 1`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n - 1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n - 1, otherwise 0)**
