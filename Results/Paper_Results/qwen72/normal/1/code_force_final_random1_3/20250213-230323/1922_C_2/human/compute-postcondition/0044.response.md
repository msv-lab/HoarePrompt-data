Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
- `m` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict Initialization**:
   - `d1` and `d2` are both defaultdicts initialized with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Values of `d2`**:
   - For any key other than `n - 1`, `d2[key]` will return 0 because it is the default value.
   - Specifically, `d2[n - 1]` is 1.

3. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Expression `d2[y] - d2[x]`**:
   - If `y == n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y != n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0.
   - If `x == n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x != n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 0.

5. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If `y != n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the possible values of `x` and `y`, the output of the print statement will be one of the following:
- **0** if neither `x` nor `y` is equal to `n - 1`.
- **1** if `y` is equal to `n - 1` and `x` is not.
- **-1** if `x` is equal to `n - 1` and `y` is not.
- **0** if both `x` and `y` are equal to `n - 1`.

However, since `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the only possible non-zero outcome is when `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, which results in `1`.

Output: **0 or 1 (where 1 is printed if y == n - 1 and x != n - 1, otherwise 0)**
