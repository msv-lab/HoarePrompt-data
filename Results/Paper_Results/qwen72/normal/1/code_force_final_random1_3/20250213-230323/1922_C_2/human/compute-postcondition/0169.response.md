Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t`, `n` is the last input integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is the last list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each city, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each city, `m` is the last input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input. The loop has completed all its iterations for all test cases. For each query `(x, y)`, if `y` > `x`, the program prints the result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y` ≤ `x`, the program prints the result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`.**
