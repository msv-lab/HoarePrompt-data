The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input.**
