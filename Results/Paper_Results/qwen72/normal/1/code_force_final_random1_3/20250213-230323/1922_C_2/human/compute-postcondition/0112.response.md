Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input. The loop has executed `m` times, and the values of `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are the inputs from the last iteration of the loop.**
