The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the following inputs:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities.
  - `a`: A list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `queries`: A list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries.

The function processes each query (x_i, y_i) and returns the distance between the cities at positions x_i and y_i in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it returns the distance between the specified cities.**
