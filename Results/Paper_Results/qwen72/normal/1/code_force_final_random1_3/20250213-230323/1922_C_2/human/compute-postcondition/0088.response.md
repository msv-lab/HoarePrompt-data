Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 + `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.***
