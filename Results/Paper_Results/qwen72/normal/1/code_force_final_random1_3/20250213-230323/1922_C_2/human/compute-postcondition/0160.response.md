To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer (greater than or equal to 3).
- `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on conditions inside a loop for each iteration.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the current user input.
- If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1` Initialization**:
   - `d1` is initialized with a default value of 0.
   - `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `d1[i + 2]` is updated in a loop, but the specific updates are not provided in the initial state. For simplicity, let's assume `i` starts at 1 and increments, so `d1[3]` might be updated, and so on.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are provided by the current user input.
   - If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`.
   - If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `x` and `y` are both keys in `d1` and have been explicitly set or updated.
- **Scenario 2**: If `x` or `y` are not keys in `d1`, they will default to 0 due to the defaultdict initialization.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `x = 2` and `y = 3`:
  - `d1[2]` is 1 (explicitly set).
  - `d1[3]` might be 0 (if not updated) or some other value (if updated).
  - The output will be `d1[3] - d1[2]`.

### General Case:
- If `x` and `y` are such that `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are both 0 (default values), the output will be 0.
- If `x` and `y` are such that one of them is 1 and the other is 0, the output will be either 1 or -1.
- If both `x` and `y` are keys with non-zero values, the output will be the difference between those values.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the nature of the defaultdict, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a defaultdict with default value 0, d1[2] is 1, and d1[i + 2] is updated based on conditions inside the loop for each iteration)**
