Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than or equal to 3), `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `y` > `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` ≤ `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
