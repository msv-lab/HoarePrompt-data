Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 2. Otherwise, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + 1` and the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.***
