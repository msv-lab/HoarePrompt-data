To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that affect the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer (greater than or equal to 3).
- `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on conditions inside the loop for each iteration.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input, where `x` is an integer and `y` is an integer greater than `x`.

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1` Initialization:**
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Loop and Updates:**
   - The loop updates `d1[i + 2]` based on some conditions, but the specific conditions are not provided. However, we know that `i` starts at 1 and `i + 2` will be 3 initially.
   - Without the exact conditions, we can assume that `d1[3]` might be updated, but we don't have enough information to determine its exact value.

3. **User Input `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, with `y` being greater than `x`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

### Possible Values:
- Since `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, any key that has not been explicitly set will return 0.
- We know `d1[2]` is 1.
- If `x` and `y` are such that they do not match any keys explicitly set in `d1`, then `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` will both be 0.

### Conclusion:
- If `x` and `y` are both greater than 2 and not explicitly set in `d1`, the result will be 0.
- If `x` is 2 and `y` is greater than 2, the result will be `d1[y] - 1`.
- If `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, the result will be 0.
- If `x` is 2 and `y` is 3 (and assuming `d1[3]` is updated to some value `v`), the result will be `v - 1`.

Given the lack of specific conditions for updating `d1`, the most precise answer based on the provided information is:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[2] is 1, and d1[i + 2] is updated based on conditions inside the loop for each iteration)**

However, if we assume the simplest case where no other keys are explicitly set, the output would be:

Output: **0 (if x and y are both greater than 2 and not explicitly set in d1)**

For a more general and precise answer, we should consider the possibility of `d1` being updated:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[2] is 1, and d1[i + 2] is updated based on conditions inside the loop for each iteration)**
