To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `x` and `y` are new integers provided by the latest user input.
   - If `y` > `x`, the state remains unchanged.
   - If `y` ≤ `x`, the state also remains unchanged.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The state remains unchanged regardless of the values of `x` and `y`.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and only `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.

3. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.
   - We need to evaluate `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` is 1 (since `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1).
   - If `y` is any other value, then `d1[y]` is 0 (since the default value of `d1` is 0).
   - Similarly, if `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` is 1.
   - If `x` is any other value, then `d1[x]` is 0.

5. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` is `0 - 0 = 0`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but we know the possible outcomes based on the values of `d1`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are 1 if the key is 2 and 0 otherwise)**

This means the output could be 0, 1, or -1 depending on the values of `x` and `y`.
