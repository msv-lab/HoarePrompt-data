Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, `func_15` seems to be calculating something unrelated to the problem statement, and `func_16` simply calls `func_15` for each test case without considering the inputs \(n\) and \(m\).

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a function that iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and checks the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not perform this check or even use the values of \(n\) and \(m\) appropriately.
