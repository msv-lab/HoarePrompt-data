You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), tmp is 1000000000, and the length of the list d[da] is greater than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. For each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, `processing[di - 1]` has been temporarily set to 1 during the loop but is reset back to 0 after the loop iteration. The length of the list `d[da]` remains greater than 1.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The value of `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. `da` is an integer key present in `d`. `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. The function returns 1 if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the initial `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of recursive calls to `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. Additionally, the value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The value of `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
