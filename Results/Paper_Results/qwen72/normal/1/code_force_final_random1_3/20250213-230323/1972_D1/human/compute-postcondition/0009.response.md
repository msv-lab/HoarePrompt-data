The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(n + i) // (i * i)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `ans` was initially `n + 1`, the new value of `ans` will be `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 2, `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n + 2) // 4`.**
