Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into separate integers, and returns an iterator of these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller will have an iterator over the integers read from the input.

#Function 3:

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are present in the function signature. The function `func_6` reads a line from standard input, strips the trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns it. This function is likely part of a larger program that processes input, but it does not directly relate to the variables n, m, or the logic required to solve the problem described.

def func_9():
    return input()
    #The program returns the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns whatever the user enters. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the user's input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits this input by whitespace, and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input data. After the function concludes, the program has a list of strings derived from the user's input.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()).

For each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, `processing[di - 1]` has been temporarily set to 1 during the loop but is reset back to 0 after the loop iteration. The length of the list `d[da]` remains greater than 1.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The value of `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers. `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. `da` is an integer key present in `d`. `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`. If the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing`). It updates the `processing` list to mark elements as processed temporarily and then resets them. The function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from the recursive calls. Additionally, the value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns (1, 0, a), where 'a' is a non-negative integer.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the results of the function `func_13(b, a % b)`. Here, `y` is the second element from the result of `func_13(b, a % b)`, `x - a // b * y` is calculated using the first element `x` from the result of `func_13(b, a % b)` and the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `g` is the third element from the result of `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple containing the second element from the recursive call, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call, respectively), and the third element from the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it returns a tuple of three values, which are derived from the recursive calls and the initial inputs `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(a), m is a positive integer, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq \text{len}(a)\), `m` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if `a[j] < m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq \text{len}(a)\), `m` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if `a[j] < m`, then `k` is updated to `k - (m - a[j])`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where `0 <= n <= len(a)`), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies the value of `k` based on the elements of `a` and the given threshold `m`, and the final state of the program is determined by the value of `k` after the iteration.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \), `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \), and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer value. It internally uses the values of `n` and `m` obtained from the function `func_7`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The function calculates the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all integers \( j \) from 1 up to the largest integer \( i - 1 \) such that \( i^2 \leq n + i \). The final result returned is this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_16`.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `func_15()` has been called as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`, and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console for each call.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to get a non-negative integer, which determines the number of times `func_15` is called. For each call to `func_15`, the result is converted to a string and printed to the console on a new line. After the function completes, the specified number of values from `func_15` have been printed to the console.
