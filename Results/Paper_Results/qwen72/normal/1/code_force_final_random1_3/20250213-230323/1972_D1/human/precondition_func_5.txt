None of the variables from the problem description are present in the function signature. The function `func_6` reads a line from standard input, strips the trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns it. This function is likely part of a larger program that processes input, but it does not directly relate to the variables n, m, or the logic required to solve the problem described.
