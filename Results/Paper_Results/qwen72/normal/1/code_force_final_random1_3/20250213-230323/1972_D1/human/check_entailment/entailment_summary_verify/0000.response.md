### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Function 16 (`func_16`)**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases using `func_10`.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.
  - The function itself is correctly structured to handle multiple test cases.

- **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
  - This function is supposed to solve the problem for a single test case.
  - However, the implementation of `func_15` does not match the problem requirements:
    - It uses a loop with a condition that is not related to the problem statement.
    - The logic inside the loop does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
    - The function returns a value that is not derived from the problem's constraints.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`:
- The function `func_15` is defined as:
  ```python
  def func_15():
      (n, m) = func_7()
      i = 1
      ans = 0
      while i * i <= n + i:
          ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
          i += 1
      return ans - 1
  ```
- This function:
  - Reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
  - Initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
  - Enters a loop where it increments `i` and updates `ans` based on a condition that is not related to the problem's requirements.
  - Returns `ans - 1`.

#### Correctness Check:
- The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the update `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not align with the problem's requirement to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The function does not use \(m\) at all, which is a critical part of the problem statement.
- The logic inside the loop is not designed to check the required condition for the pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_15` does not handle the required conditions and does not produce the correct results for the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
