Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_10` to get a non-negative integer, which determines the number of times `func_15` is called. For each call to `func_15`, the result is converted to a string and printed to the console on a new line. After the function completes, the specified number of values from `func_15` have been printed to the console. **
