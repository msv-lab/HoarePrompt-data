To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.
- `func_15()` has been called twice and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console twice.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.
2. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`.
3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.
   - `func_15()` has been called twice and its result has been printed twice.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop uses `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `func_10()` must remain such that it returns a value greater than 0.
- The state of `func_15()` and its calls do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `func_15()` has been called twice and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console twice.**
