The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character. Since `func_15()` has already been called and its result printed to the console, calling it again will produce another instance of its result being printed. However, the initial state mentions that `func_15()` has been called and its result has been printed, which means the function's side effect (printing) has already occurred.

Given that `func_15()` returns a value, and this value is converted to a string and written to the standard output, the output state will reflect that the function has been called again and its result has been printed.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `func_15()` has been called twice and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console twice.**
