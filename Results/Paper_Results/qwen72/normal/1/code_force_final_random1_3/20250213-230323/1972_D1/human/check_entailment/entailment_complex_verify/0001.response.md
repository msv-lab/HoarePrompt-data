### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_15**: This function is supposed to solve the problem for a single test case.
     - It reads `n` and `m` using `func_7()`.
     - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
     - It enters a loop where it increments `i` and updates `ans` based on the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

   - **func_16**: This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and writes the result to standard output.

3. **Correctness of func_15**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not directly address the problem statement. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\) do not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.
   - The function `func_15` is not correctly implementing the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` is not aligned with the problem's constraints and conditions.
