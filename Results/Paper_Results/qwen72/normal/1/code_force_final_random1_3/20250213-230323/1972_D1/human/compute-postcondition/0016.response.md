The function `func_15` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it implicitly works with two positive integers `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The function calculates the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \). Here, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \).

Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \), and `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \).**
