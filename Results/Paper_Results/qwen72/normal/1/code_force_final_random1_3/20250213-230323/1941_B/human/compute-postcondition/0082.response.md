Postcondition: ***After the loop has executed all its iterations, if `stop` is `True`, the state remains unchanged. If the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` is not 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if both the last element and the second-to-last element of `a` are 0, the state remains unchanged.***
