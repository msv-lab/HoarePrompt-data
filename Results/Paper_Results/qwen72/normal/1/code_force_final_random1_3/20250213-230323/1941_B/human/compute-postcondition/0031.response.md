Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, where each element `a_j` satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `opNum` is now `a[2]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - a[1]`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - a[0] - opNum`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * a[2]`, `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 2 * opNum`, `stop` is True if `a[1]` is less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False, and `n` must be greater than 4. If `a[2]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` updates the value of `a[3]` (since `i` is 2) by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
