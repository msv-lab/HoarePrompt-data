Output State: **`numTest` is incremented by 1, `stop` is `True`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, the last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0, the second-to-last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `opNum` is equal to `a[0]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is now `a[1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is now `a[2] - opNum`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
