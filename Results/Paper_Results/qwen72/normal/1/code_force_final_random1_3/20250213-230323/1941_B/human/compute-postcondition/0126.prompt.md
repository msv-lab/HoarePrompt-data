You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer for each test case such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numTest` is decremented by the number of iterations completed (equal to the initial value of `numTest`). For each test case, if `stop` is `True`, it indicates that a negative value was encountered in `a` during the loop execution, and the program printed 'NO' and moved to the next test case. If `stop` is `False`, the array `a` is modified such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-3`, `a[i]` is reduced by `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` is reduced by `2 * a[i]`, and `a[i+2]` is reduced by `a[i]`. After these modifications, if the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0, the program printed 'NO'. Otherwise, if both the last two elements of `a` are 0, the program printed 'YES'. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each test case is restored before the next test case starts, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function processes the list `a` and returns a result specific to the processing logic (not detailed here).

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
