Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder (its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
