Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
