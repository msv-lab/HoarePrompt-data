Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it converts to `12` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it remains the same.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 to convert it to the corresponding 12-hour format.
3. **Minute Handling**: The minutes remain the same in both formats.
4. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - If the hour is `12` or greater, it appends `PM`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `AM`.

Let's break down the code step by step:

- **Reading Input**:
  ```python
  for t in range(int(input())):
      s = input()
  ```
  This correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads each time string.

- **Extracting Hour and Minute**:
  ```python
  h = s[:2]
  ```
  This correctly extracts the hour part of the string.

- **Converting Hours**:
  ```python
  if h == '00':
      print('12', end='')
  elif int(h) <= 12:
      print(h, end='')
  else:
      print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
  ```
  - If the hour is `00`, it prints `12`.
  - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it prints the hour as is.
  - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 and prints the result, ensuring it is zero-padded if necessary.

- **Printing Minutes and AM/PM**:
  ```python
  print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
  ```
  - It prints the minutes part of the string.
  - It determines whether to append `AM` or `PM` based on the hour.

However, there is a minor issue in the hour conversion logic when the hour is between `13` and `23`. The current implementation uses `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`, which will always add a leading zero, even when the hour is a two-digit number after subtraction. This can lead to incorrect formatting, such as `09` instead of `09` for `21:37`.

To fix this, we should use `print('{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` to ensure the hour is always formatted as a two-digit number.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

Final: **False**

The original assessment was mostly correct, but the hour conversion logic had a minor formatting issue that needed to be addressed. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct as originally assessed.
