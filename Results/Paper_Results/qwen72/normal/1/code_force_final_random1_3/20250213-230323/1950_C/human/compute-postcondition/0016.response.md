The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('12', end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function in Python outputs text to the console.
- The argument `'12'` is a string literal, so it will be printed as is.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the print statement should not add a newline character (`\n`) at the end. Instead, it will end with an empty string, meaning the next print statement (if any) will continue on the same line.

### Initial State:
- The initial state mentions variables `t`, `s`, and `h`, but these variables are not used in the given `print` statement.
- The value of `t` is an integer between 2 and 1441.
- The value of `s` is a string in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- The value of `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1, representing the hours part of the time.

### What is Printed:
- The `print` statement will output the string `'12'` without adding a newline at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **12**
