Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Time Conversion**:
   - It extracts the hour part `h` from the input string `s`.
   - If the hour is `00`, it correctly prints `12` to represent midnight in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result, ensuring the hour is correctly formatted in 12-hour format.
3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - It correctly appends 'AM' if the hour is less than 12.
   - It correctly appends 'PM' if the hour is 12 or greater.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the time in the required format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

The program handles all edge cases correctly, such as converting `00:00` to `12:00 AM` and `12:00` to `12:00 PM`. It also maintains the leading zeros for hours and minutes as required.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
