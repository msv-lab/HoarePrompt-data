The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The function returns a new time in the same "hh:mm" format after adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time. It returns a new time in the same format after adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.**
