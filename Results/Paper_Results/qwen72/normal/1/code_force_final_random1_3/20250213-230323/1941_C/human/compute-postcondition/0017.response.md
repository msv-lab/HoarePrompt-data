Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the new input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`, which is now explicitly calculated and updated.
