The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Since the loop is controlled by the input, and the input is expected to be the number of test cases (`t`), the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is not relevant to the state outside the loop, but it will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (loop counter), and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes**
