You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string s, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: _ is t-1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the last input integer greater than 0, `s` is the last input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the last `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to ensure it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". If the string already does not contain these substrings, the answer is 0.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string.
   - It prints the sum of these counts as the result.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Counting**: The program uses `s.count('map')` and `s.count('pie')` to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". However, this approach is incorrect because it only counts non-overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string "mapmap", `s.count('map')` will return 2, but the correct answer should be 3 because "map" can overlap.
   - **Minimum Deletions Calculation**: The program assumes that the number of deletions required is simply the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie". This is incorrect because removing one character can affect multiple substrings. For example, in the string "mapmap", removing the 'a' at position 1 will remove both "map" substrings.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a more sophisticated method to count the minimum number of deletions required. One approach is to use dynamic programming or a sliding window technique to find the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.
