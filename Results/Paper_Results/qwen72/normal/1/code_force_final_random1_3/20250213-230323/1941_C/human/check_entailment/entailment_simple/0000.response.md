Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by removing occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". However, the current implementation only counts the occurrences of these substrings and sums them up, which is incorrect because:

1. **Substring Overlap**: The program does not account for overlapping occurrences of "pie" and "map". For example, in the string "mapmap", the program would count two "map" substrings, but removing one "map" would also remove part of the other "map". Therefore, the actual number of deletions needed is less than what the program calculates.

2. **Minimum Deletions Calculation**: The program should calculate the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map". This involves identifying the positions of these substrings and determining the optimal way to remove the fewest characters to eliminate all occurrences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is "piemappie", the program would count one "pie" and one "map", but the correct answer should be 3 deletions (removing the middle 'm', 'a', and 'p') to make the string beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
