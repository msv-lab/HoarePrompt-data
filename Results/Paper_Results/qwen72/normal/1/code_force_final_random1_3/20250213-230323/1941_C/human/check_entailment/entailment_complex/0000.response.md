Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and prints their sum. However, the problem requires determining the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the string `s`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
1. Identify all occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string.
2. Determine the minimum number of deletions required to eliminate all such occurrences.

The current implementation only counts the substrings but does not account for the overlapping occurrences or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid these substrings.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
