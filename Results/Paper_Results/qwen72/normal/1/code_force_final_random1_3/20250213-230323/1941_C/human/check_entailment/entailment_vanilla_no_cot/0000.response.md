Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it only counts the occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the resulting string. The current solution does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still form "map" or "pie" after some characters are removed.

A correct approach would involve identifying all possible positions where "map" or "pie" can appear and calculating the minimum deletions required to break these patterns. This typically involves more complex logic, such as dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, to ensure the minimum number of deletions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    # Initialize variables to track the minimum deletions needed
    deletions = 0
    i = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    while i < n:
        if i + 2 < n and s[i:i+3] == "map":
            deletions += 1
            i += 3
        elif i + 2 < n and s[i:i+3] == "pie":
            deletions += 1
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    
    return deletions

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))

# Example usage
func()
```

This function `min_deletions_to_beautiful` iterates through the string and checks for occurrences of "map" and "pie". If found, it increments the deletion count and skips the next two characters to avoid counting overlapping substrings multiple times. This ensures that the minimum number of deletions is calculated correctly.
