You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #State: _ is t-1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]`, and `i` is -1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where each element of `a` is defined as \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of the permutation up to index `i`.

2. **Reversing the Process**: To find `p`, we need to reverse the process of constructing `a`. Given \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), we can rearrange this to find \( p_i \):
   \[
   p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i
   \]

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX when considering the entire permutation. This is because initially, all numbers from 0 to n-1 are potential candidates for MEX.

4. **Backward Construction**: The program iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates \( p_i \) using the formula \( p_i = mex - ar[i] \). It then updates `mex` to the newly calculated \( p_i \) if it is smaller than the current `mex`.

5. **Output**: After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the elements of `res`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints well, including the possibility of multiple valid permutations. Since the problem guarantees at least one valid permutation, the program should always produce a valid result.

7. **Efficiency**: The program uses a single pass through the array `ar` and performs constant-time operations for each element, making it efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
