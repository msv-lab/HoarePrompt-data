Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, res is a list of n elements where res[0] is now mex - ar[0], i is -1, and res[-1] is mex - ar[-1]. If mex > mex - ar[-1], then mex is updated to n - 2 * ar[-1] if ar[-1] > 0.**
