Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Specifically, `res[i]` is now equal to `(n - ar[len(ar) - 1]) - ar[i]`.
