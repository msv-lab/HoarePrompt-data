The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from the current value of `mex`. Given that `i` is -1, `ar[i]` refers to the last element of the list `ar`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `mex` was initially defined as `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`.
- `i` is -1, so `ar[i]` is `ar[-1]`.
- The new value of `mex` is `mex - ar[-1]`, which simplifies to `(n - ar[-1]) - ar[-1]` or `n - 2 * ar[-1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]`, `mex` is `n - 2 * ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`, `i` is -1, and `res[-1]` is `mex - ar[-1]`.**
