The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from its current value. Given the initial state:

- `_` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`
- `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
- `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`

After executing the code snippet:

- `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which means `mex` is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[i]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**
