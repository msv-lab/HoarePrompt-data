The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `ar`.

- The initial state specifies that `_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is equal to `t`.
- After executing the code, the variable `ar` will contain a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `_`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
