The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the value at index `i` in the list `res` to the result of `mex - ar[i]`. Here's the detailed calculation:

- `mex` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, which means it points to the last element of the list `ar`.
- `ar[i]` is the last element of the list `ar`.

So, the value at index `i` in `res` is updated to `n - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**.
