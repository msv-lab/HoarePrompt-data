Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the construction of the permutation `p` correctly in all cases. Specifically, the logic for updating `mex` and constructing `res` is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
The program incorrectly updates the `mex` value and constructs the `res` array. In the given example, the correct `mex` values for each step should be:

- For `a[0] = 1`: `mex = 1`, so `p[0] = 0`.
- For `a[1] = 1`: `mex = 2`, so `p[1] = 1`.
- For `a[2] = -2`: `mex = 4`, so `p[2] = 4`.
- For `a[3] = 1`: `mex = 3`, so `p[3] = 2`.
- For `a[4] = 2`: `mex = 5`, so `p[4] = 3`.

However, the program incorrectly sets `mex` and thus constructs an incorrect `res` array. This leads to the wrong output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
