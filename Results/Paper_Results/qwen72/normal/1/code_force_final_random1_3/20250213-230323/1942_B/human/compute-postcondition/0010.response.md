To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the loop head or body, so it remains unchanged.)
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`
- `res[i]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- The loop variable `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(ar) - 2`.

### Updated State:
- The list `ar` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to continue.
- The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `res`, `mex`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[i + 1]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i + 1]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.**
