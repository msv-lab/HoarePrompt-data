Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers derived from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element res[i] is now mex - ar[i] for i from 0 to n-1, mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list [mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)], and i is -1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order, updating the `res` list and the `mex` value.
- For each iteration, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- The `mex` value is then updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `res` contains the values `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The final value of `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]`.
- The variable `i` is -1 because the loop has completed and the loop variable is no longer being used.
