Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` starting from the last element to the first, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`), and `i` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers derived from the user input, res is a list of n elements where each element res[i] is now mex - ar[i] for i from 0 to n-1, mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list [mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)], and i is -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
