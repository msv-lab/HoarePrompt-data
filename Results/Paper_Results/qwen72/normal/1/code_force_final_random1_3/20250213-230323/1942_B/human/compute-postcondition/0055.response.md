Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]`, `mex` is `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`, `i` is -1, and `res[-1]` is `mex - ar[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is `mex - ar[0]`.
- The variable `mex` is defined as `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`.
- The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the last element of the list `res` (since `i` is -1) to be `mex - ar[-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
