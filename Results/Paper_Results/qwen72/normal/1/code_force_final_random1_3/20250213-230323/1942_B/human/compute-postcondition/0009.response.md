Postcondition: **_ is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `res[i]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.**
