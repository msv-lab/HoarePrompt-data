t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
