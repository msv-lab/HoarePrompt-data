Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is specified to be equal to `t`) to the variable `n`. Since the input value is equal to `t`, `n` is now equal to `t`. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
