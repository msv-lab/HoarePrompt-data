Output State: **_ is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` starting from the last element to the first, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`), and `i` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last index of `ar` to the first index (i.e., from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`).
- In each iteration, the value of `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `res` will contain the values calculated for each index from the last to the first.
- The final value of `mex` will be `n - sum(ar)`, which is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n`.
- The loop variable `i` will be -1 after the loop finishes, as it decrements to -1 after the last iteration.
