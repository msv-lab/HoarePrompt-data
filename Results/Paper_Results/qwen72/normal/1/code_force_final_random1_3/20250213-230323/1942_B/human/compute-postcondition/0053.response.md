Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]`, `mex` is `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`, and `i` is 0. If `mex > mex - ar[0]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[-1] - ar[0]` if `ar[-1] > 0`.***
