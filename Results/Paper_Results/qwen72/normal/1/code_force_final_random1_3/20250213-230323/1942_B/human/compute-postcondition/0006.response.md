Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is equal to `t`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `res[i]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `mex` is equal to `t` and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the value of `res[i]` becomes `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
