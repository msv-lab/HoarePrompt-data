The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters: `t` and a list of lists `cases`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function is expected to process each test case and return a result for each.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely processes each test case to find a valid permutation `p` for the given data, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. However, the specific output for each test case is not clearly defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of test cases `cases`, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to find a valid permutation `p` for the given data and returns a result for each test case.**
