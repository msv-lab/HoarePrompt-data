The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times

After executing the code, the list `nums` will contain the integers provided by the user as input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
