The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the maximum value among the first `n-1` books and the last book's page count, then prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the completion of all iterations over the test cases, with the results printed to the standard output.
