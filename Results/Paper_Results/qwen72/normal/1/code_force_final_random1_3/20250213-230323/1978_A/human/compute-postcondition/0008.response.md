Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times.
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `n` is now an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `nums`**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user. The exact values of these integers are not specified, but they are part of the input.

2. **Understanding `max(nums[:-1])`**:
   - `nums[:-1]` is a slice of the list `nums` that includes all elements except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among the elements in this sliced list.

3. **Understanding `nums[-1]`**:
   - `nums[-1]` is the last element of the list `nums`.

4. **Combining the Values**:
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the sliced list to the last element of the list.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of the maximum value from the list `nums` excluding the last element and the last element of the list `nums`.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value of the list `nums` excluding the last element, and nums[-1] is the last element of the list `nums`)**
