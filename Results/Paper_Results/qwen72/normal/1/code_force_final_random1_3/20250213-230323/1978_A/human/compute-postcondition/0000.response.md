The value of `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through the `input()` function. The constraints for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) remain valid as specified in the initial state. The variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
