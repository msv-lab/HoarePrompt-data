You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` has iterated `t` times, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of books in each test case), and `a` (a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the number of pages in the books across the test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
