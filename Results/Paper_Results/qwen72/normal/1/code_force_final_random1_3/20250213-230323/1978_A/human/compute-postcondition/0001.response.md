The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, this condition is inherently satisfied. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, indicating that its specific value is not important; it just needs to iterate `t` times.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, which is already given. No further adjustment is necessary for `t` or `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times**
