The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`. It swaps the elements at the positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l` and returns the modified list. After the function executes, the list `l` has its elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The function ensures that the list `l` is of length at least `c + k`.
