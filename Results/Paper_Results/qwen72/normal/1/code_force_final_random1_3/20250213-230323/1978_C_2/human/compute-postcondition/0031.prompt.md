You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the number of iterations the loop has run, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` will be reduced by the sum of the series of odd numbers from `n` down to 1 (or 0 if `n` is even), and then incremented by the number of iterations. The list `l` will be the result of applying `func_3` to the initial list `n` times, once for each iteration. The loop will terminate when `i` becomes -1, and the final value of `i` will be -1. If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, the function will return the current state of `l`. If `k` becomes less than `i - 1` during the loop, the function will return the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns different results: a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the result of calling `func_2` or `func_3` with specific arguments, or the result of updating and calling `func_2` or `func_3` with modified arguments.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the list `l` which contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000.

Case_2: The program returns the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `c` set to 1, `k` set to `k // 2` (which is a non-negative integer less than `i - 1`), and `l` set to a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Case_3: The program returns the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2 and `l` is the initial value of `l`. The exact value of `l` depends on the implementation of `func_3` and the initial value of `l`.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is 2, `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` with `c` being 2 and `l` being the initial value of `l`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2 and `l` is the initial value of `l`.

Case_5: The program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.

Case_6: The program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is the value of `c` increased by 1, `k` is the value of `k` after being updated to `k - (n - 2) + 1` and is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
