You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is -1, `k` is reduced based on the sum of the series (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1, `l` is modified such that elements are moved to the front of the list according to the rules specified in the loop, and if `1 + i > k` at any point, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` from the end of the list `l`, and if `k` becomes 0, the list `l` is returned in its current state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. The function returns a modified list `l` based on the specified conditions, inserting the element `x` at different positions depending on the value of `k` and the current state of the list.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `l`, which is not defined in the initial state.

Case_2: The program returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the position `-k` from the end, and `x` is no longer the last element of `l`.

Case_3: The program returns the list `l` which now has `x` inserted at the beginning and `x` is no longer the last element of the list.

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` which now includes `x` inserted at the position `-k` from the end, and `x` is no longer at the end of the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as modified.

Case_5: The program returns the list `l` with `x` inserted at the beginning if `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` from the end of the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as modified.

Case_6: The program returns the list `l` which now contains the element `x` at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`), and `x` is no longer the last element of the list `l`. The list `l` has been modified such that the element `x` is placed at the specified index, and the rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged except for the removal of `x` from its original position at the end of the list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
