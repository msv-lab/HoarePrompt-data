Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum `k` Value**: The function `func_4` calculates the maximum possible `k` value incorrectly. The correct maximum `k` value for a permutation of length `n` is `n * (n - 1)`, not `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2` or `n ** 2 // 2`.

2. **Incorrect Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_3` for constructing the permutation is flawed. The way elements are swapped in `func_3` does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Handling of Even and Odd `n`**: The logic for handling even and odd `n` values is not correctly implemented. The maximum `k` value should be the same for both even and odd `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is zero or when `n` is very small.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def find_permutation(n, k):
    if k > n * (n - 1):
        return None
    if k % 2 != 0:
        return None

    perm = list(range(1, n + 1))
    swaps = k // 2
    for i in range(swaps):
        perm[i], perm[n - 1 - i] = perm[n - 1 - i], perm[i]

    return perm

def solve_test_case():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    perm = find_permutation(n, k)
    if perm is None:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(" ".join(map(str, perm)))

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        solve_test_case()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected solution:
- Correctly calculates the maximum possible `k` value.
- Constructs the permutation by swapping pairs of elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- Handles edge cases and ensures the permutation is valid.
