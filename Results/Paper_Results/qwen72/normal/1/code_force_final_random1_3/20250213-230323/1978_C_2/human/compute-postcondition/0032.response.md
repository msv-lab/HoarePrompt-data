The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given that `x` was the last element of the list `l` before this operation, `x` is removed from the list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` no longer contains `x` as its last element.**
