### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_4**: This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value must be even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that achieves the required Manhattan value `k`. It uses a series of swaps to adjust the permutation.
   - **func_2** and **func_3**: These functions perform specific swaps in the permutation list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_6**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate the input, then `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_4** correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`.
   - **func_1** attempts to construct the permutation by making swaps. However, the logic in `func_1` is complex and may not always produce the correct permutation. Specifically, the loop and swap conditions might not cover all edge cases.
   - **func_2** and **func_3** perform specific swaps, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.
   - **func_6** correctly handles the overall flow and output.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation is not straightforward and might fail for certain edge cases or large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not always lead to the correct permutation.
   - The swap operations in `func_2` and `func_3` might not always result in the desired Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and potential issues in the permutation construction logic, the program might not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not guaranteed.

Correctness: **False**
