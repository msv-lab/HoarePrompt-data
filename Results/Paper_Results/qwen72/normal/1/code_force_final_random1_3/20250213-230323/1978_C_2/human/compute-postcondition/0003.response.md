Output State: **The program returns without any value.** 

In this case, since there is no expression or variable specified in the return statement, the function simply returns `None`. However, as per the instruction, we should describe the state of the program. Here, the function ends its execution and does not return any specific value or variable. The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were last updated by `func_4()`, but these are not returned.
