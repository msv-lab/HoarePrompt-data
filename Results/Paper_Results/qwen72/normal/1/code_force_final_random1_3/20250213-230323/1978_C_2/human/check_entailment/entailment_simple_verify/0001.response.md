### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_4**: This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value must be even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
     - **Correctness**: This function correctly checks the parity of `k` and the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n`.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that achieves the required Manhattan value `k`. It uses a series of swaps to adjust the permutation.
     - **Correctness**: The logic in `func_1` is designed to reduce `k` by performing swaps. However, the loop and swap conditions might not cover all edge cases, especially for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - **func_2** and **func_3**: These functions perform specific swaps in the permutation list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - **Correctness**: These functions perform the swaps as intended, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.
   - **func_6**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate the input, then `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result.
     - **Correctness**: This function correctly handles the overall flow and output.

3. **Detailed Evaluation**:
   - **func_4**: The function correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`. The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated correctly.
   - **func_1**: The function attempts to construct the permutation by making swaps. The loop iterates from `n` down to 1 in steps of 2, reducing `k` by the value of `i - 1` and performing swaps using `func_3`. If `k` becomes less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to make a more precise swap.
     - **Potential Issues**: The logic in `func_1` might not always produce the correct permutation, especially for large values of `n` and `k`. The condition `if k < i - 1:` might not always lead to the correct permutation, and the swap operations might not always result in the desired Manhattan value.
   - **func_2** and **func_3**: These functions perform specific swaps, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.
   - **func_6**: This function correctly handles the overall flow and output.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program has a well-defined structure and logic for constructing the permutation.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation is complex and might not always produce the correct permutation, especially for certain edge cases or large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not always lead to the correct permutation, and the swap operations might not always result in the desired Manhattan value.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the potential issues in the permutation construction logic, the program might not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not guaranteed.

Final: **False**
