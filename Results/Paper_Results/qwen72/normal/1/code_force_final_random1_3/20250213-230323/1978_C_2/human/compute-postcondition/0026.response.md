Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is the value of `c` increased by 1, `k` is the value of `k` after being updated to `k - (n - 2) + 1` and is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything explicitly.***
