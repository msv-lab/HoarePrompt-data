You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist represents the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`. Each sublist in `u2vs` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index. The connections are bidirectional, meaning if node `u` is connected to node `v`, then both `u2vs[u]` will contain `v` and `u2vs[v]` will contain `u`. The loop has run `n-1` times, so each pair of connected nodes has been added to their respective sublists.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)

        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`. If the final value of `n` is -1, it indicates that the path has been fully traced back to the starting node 0.
    ops = []

        ci = len(path_ba) // 2

            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., up to `(c, ci)`, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba`.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is the last valid index in the loop, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`.
    #State: *`ops` is a list of tuples derived from `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., up to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`. In both cases, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if path_ba has an odd length, or len(path_ba) if path_ba has an even length)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 3 1
    #4 1
    #3 3
    #4 3
    #3 5
    #4 5
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `u2vs`, a list of lists where each sublist represents the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
