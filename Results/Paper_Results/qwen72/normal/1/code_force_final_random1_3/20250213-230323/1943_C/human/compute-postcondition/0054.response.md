Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., up to `(c, ci)`, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `ops` will contain tuples where the first element is `c` (the element at the middle index of `path_ba`) and the second element ranges from 0 to `ci` (inclusive). The other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously determined states.
