The code snippet `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n` based on the value of `previous` at the index specified by the last element of `path_ba`.

- `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `path_ba`, which is `n`.
- `previous[path_ba[-1]]` means accessing the value in the `previous` list at the index `n`.

Therefore, the new value of `n` is set to the value found in the `previous` list at the index `n`.

Output State: **`n` is now equal to `previous[n]`, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and the original value of `n`.**
