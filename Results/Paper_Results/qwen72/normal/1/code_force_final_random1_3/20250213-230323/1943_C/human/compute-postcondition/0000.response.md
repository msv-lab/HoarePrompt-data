Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.** 

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged and still represents the list of lists where each sublist contains the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.
