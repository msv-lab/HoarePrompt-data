The code snippet `ops.append((c2, i))` adds a new tuple to the list `ops`. This tuple consists of the values of `c2` and `i`.

- `c2` is defined as half the length of `path_ba`, which is an integer.
- `i` is given as 1.

Given the initial state:
- `ops` initially contains the tuple `(c1, 1)`.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code, the new tuple `(c2, 1)` is appended to `ops`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.
- `c2` remains half the length of `path_ba`.
- `c1` remains `c2 - 1`.
- `i` remains 1.

All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 1, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n` and must have at least 2 elements.**
