Output State: **`ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is 5, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n` and must have at least 9 elements.** 

Explanation: The tuple `(c1, 5)` is appended to the list `ops`, which now includes the new tuple along with the existing ones. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
