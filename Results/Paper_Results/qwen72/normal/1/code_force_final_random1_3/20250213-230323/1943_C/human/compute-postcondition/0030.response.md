Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
