Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is a binary string of length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is updated to a new input binary string, `j` is 1, `len(s)` must be greater than 2. If the first two characters of `s` are different, `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', `flag` is True. If `s[j]` is different from `s[j + 1]`, `count` is 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
