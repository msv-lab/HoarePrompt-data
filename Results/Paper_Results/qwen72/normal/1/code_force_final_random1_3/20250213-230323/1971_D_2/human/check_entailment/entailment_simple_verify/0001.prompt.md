You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and s is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is `t`, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is `len(s) - 1`. For each iteration, if `flag` is True, indicating there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed immediately by '1' in `s`, then `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different minus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different, and `flag` remains False. After all iterations, the loop has processed `t` binary strings, and for each string, the number of transitions between '0' and '1' (plus 1 if no '0' to '1' transition exists) has been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop.
     - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j+1]`, it increments `count`.
     - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `count`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies transitions between different characters and counts them.
   - However, the decrement of `count` when `flag` is `True` is unnecessary and incorrect. This is because the transition from '0' to '1' should not reduce the count but rather ensure that the pieces can be rearranged correctly.
   - The correct approach is to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and add 1 to account for the initial piece.

4. **Corrected Logic:**
   - Initialize `count` to 1.
   - Iterate through the string and increment `count` whenever there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - Print `count`.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it incorrectly decrements the count when a transition from '0' to '1' is found. The correct approach should not decrement the count in this case.

Correctness: **False**
