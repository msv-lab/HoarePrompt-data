Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to correctly count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `0` because we are counting pairs, and initially, there are no pairs counted.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Pairs**:
   - The loop that increments `count` from `2` to `m` is not correctly implemented. The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not correctly count the pairs that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), but the program's output is `2` instead of `1`.

### Example Case:
- For the input `1 1`, the correct output should be `1` because the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\). However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
