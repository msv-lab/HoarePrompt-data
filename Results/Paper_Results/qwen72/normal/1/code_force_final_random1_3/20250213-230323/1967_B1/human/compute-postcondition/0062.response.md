To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are updated to new input integers.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `count` is `m + 1`.
- `ans` is computed as `n + sum(int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `countmins` is `m - 1`.
- `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The expression inside the `sum` function is `int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1` for each `k` in the range from 2 to `m + 1`.
   - This expression calculates a value for each `k` and sums them up.

2. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the sum of `n` and the result of the `sum` function.
   - Therefore, `ans = n + sum(int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 3` for simplicity.

- For `k = 2`:
  - `int(n / k) = int(10 / 2) = 5`
  - `int((5 - 1) / 2) + 1 = int(4 / 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`

- For `k = 3`:
  - `int(n / k) = int(10 / 3) = 3`
  - `int((3 - 2) / 3) + 1 = int(1 / 3) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`

- For `k = 4`:
  - `int(n / k) = int(10 / 4) = 2`
  - `int((2 - 3) / 4) + 1 = int(-1 / 4) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`

- Summing these values:
  - `sum = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5`

- Therefore, `ans = 10 + 5 = 15`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`.

Output: **15 (where ans is the value of n plus the sum of the calculated terms for k in the range from 2 to m + 1)**

This is the most precise description based on the given initial state and the formula for `ans`.
