Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) - 2 / 3) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
