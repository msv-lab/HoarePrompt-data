The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
