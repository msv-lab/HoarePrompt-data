Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
