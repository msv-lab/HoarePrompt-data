The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should operate with two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, typically such functions might return a result based on operations involving `n` and `m`.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will assume a generic functionality based on common practices for functions dealing with two integers:

Functionality: **The function operates with two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns a result based on some operation involving these integers. The exact nature of the operation and the return value are not specified.**
