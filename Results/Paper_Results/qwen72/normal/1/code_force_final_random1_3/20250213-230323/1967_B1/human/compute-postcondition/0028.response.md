The code snippet `ans += int(g / count) + 1` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` and `m` are input integers.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `count` is 5.
   - `ans` is `n + (int(int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `countmins` is 4.
   - `g` is `int(n / 5) - 4`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the condition is not specified to be true, we assume it is not less than `countmins`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `g` is `int(n / 5) - 4`.
   - `int(g / count)` is `int((int(n / 5) - 4) / 5)`.
   - `int(g / count) + 1` is `int((int(n / 5) - 4) / 5) + 1`.

4. **Update `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + int((int(n / 5) - 4) / 5) + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + (int(int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1 + int((int(n / 5) - 4) / 5) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / 5) - 4`.**
