Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`) retain their initial values or conditions.
