To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(map(str, ans)))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `array` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from that index.
   - `j` is `l-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `array` is a list of integers.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is constructed by mapping each element in `rev_array` to a corresponding letter in `alp`.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - For each element in `rev_array`, starting from the last element (index `l-1`), we map it to a letter in `alp`.
   - The mapping is done based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from the current index.

4. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - Suppose `array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` and `l = 5`.
   - `rev_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
   - We start from the end of `rev_array` and map each element to a letter in `alp`:
     - `rev_array[4] = 1` -> 'a'
     - `rev_array[3] = 2` -> 'b'
     - `rev_array[2] = 3` -> 'c'
     - `rev_array[1] = 2` -> 'b'
     - `rev_array[0] = 1` -> 'a'
   - Therefore, `ans = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'a']`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(''.join(map(str, ans)))` statement will join the elements of `ans` into a single string and print it.

Given the initial state and the construction of `ans`, the output will be a string of letters corresponding to the elements in `rev_array` mapped to `alp`.

Output: **'abcba' (where the string is constructed by mapping each element in the reversed array to a corresponding letter in the alphabet list `alp`)**
