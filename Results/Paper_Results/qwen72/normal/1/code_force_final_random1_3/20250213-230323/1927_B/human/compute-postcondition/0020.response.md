To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(l):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `j` and the value `l`. The loop will execute if `l` is greater than 0, because `range(l)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `l-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0
- `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input
- `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `j` is `l-1`

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `l`. Since `l` is already specified as an input integer greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once.

However, the variable `j` is initialized to `l-1` before the loop starts. For the loop to execute correctly, `j` should be initialized to 0, as the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `l-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
