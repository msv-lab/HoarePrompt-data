Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in the new `rev_array` starting from that index, `j` is `l-1`.** 

The code snippet `rev_array = array[::-1]` reverses the list `array` and assigns the reversed list to `rev_array`. All other variables remain unchanged.
