The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `array`. This impacts the value of `array` while leaving the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements where each element is the letter corresponding to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1 in the alphabet, `j` is `l-1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**
