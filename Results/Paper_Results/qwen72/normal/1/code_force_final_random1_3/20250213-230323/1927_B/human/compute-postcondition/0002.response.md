The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `array`.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `l` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- A new variable `array` is created, which is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
