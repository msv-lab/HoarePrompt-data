Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `r = c` correctly. According to the problem description, if `r = c`, the computer skips its turn. However, the current implementation always adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set, which means it incorrectly treats the computer's turn as if it placed a rook, even when `r = c`. This leads to an incorrect count of invalid positions and, consequently, an incorrect number of possible final configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 1
```
The expected output should be `6` because the computer skips its turn, and you can place rooks in the following positions:
- (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
- (2, 3), (3, 2)
- (2, 4), (4, 2)
- (3, 4), (4, 3)

However, the program will incorrectly output `3` because it treats the computer's turn as if it placed a rook at (1, 1).
