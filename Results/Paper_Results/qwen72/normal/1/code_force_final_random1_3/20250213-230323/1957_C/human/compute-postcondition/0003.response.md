The value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[2]` is 3. Plugging these values into the formula:

- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 4) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = 7 % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = 7`

Therefore, the value of `dp[3]` is 7. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
