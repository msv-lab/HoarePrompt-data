Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**: The program starts by setting the recursion limit to 400,000, which is necessary because the dynamic programming (DP) table is computed up to 300,000. This ensures that the program can handle large values of `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized with `-1` for all indices up to 300,000. This table will store the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows/cols.

3. **Precomputation of DP Table**: The function `func_1` precomputes the DP table up to `n = 300,000` using the recurrence relation:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board.
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board, considering the constraints of the problem.

4. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

5. **Tracking Invalid Rows and Columns**: A set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks due to the initial moves. This ensures that these positions are not considered for future moves.

6. **Calculating the Number of Valid Configurations**: For each test case, the program calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows/columns from `n` and looking up the result in the precomputed DP table. The result is printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

7. **Edge Case Handling**: The program ensures that the result is at least 1 by using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, which handles the case where all rows and columns are invalid.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The precomputation of the DP table and the handling of invalid rows/columns are done efficiently and accurately.

Correctness: **True**
