Precondition: **n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.** 

However, the provided function definition `def func_1(n):` does not match the complexity of the problem described. The function should accept multiple parameters to handle the test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of initial moves, and the specific moves made. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def count_final_configurations(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of moves. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (4, 1, [(1, 2)]),
    (8, 1, [(7, 6)]),
    (1000, 4, [(4, 4), (952, 343), (222, 333), (90, 91)])
]
```

Given this, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case is a tuple (n, k, moves), where n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5), k is an integer representing the number of initial moves (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and moves is a list of k tuples (r_i, c_i) representing the positions of the initial moves, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n.**
