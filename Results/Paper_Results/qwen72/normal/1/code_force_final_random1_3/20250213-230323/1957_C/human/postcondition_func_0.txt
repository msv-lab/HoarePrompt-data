The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5) representing the size of a chessboard. It computes a sequence `dp` using a specific recurrence relation and stores the result up to `dp[n]`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but after its execution, the array `dp` will have `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[n]` will contain the final computed value based on the recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. The input parameter `n` remains unchanged.
