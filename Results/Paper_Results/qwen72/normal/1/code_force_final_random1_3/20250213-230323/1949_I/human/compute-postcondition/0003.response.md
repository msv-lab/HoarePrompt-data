Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of None values of length n, y is a list of None values of length n, r is a list of None values of length n, visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and coef is a list of None values, both of length n.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`.
- The initial state specified that `r` was a list of integers representing the radii of disks, but this is now overwritten by the new list of `None` values.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
