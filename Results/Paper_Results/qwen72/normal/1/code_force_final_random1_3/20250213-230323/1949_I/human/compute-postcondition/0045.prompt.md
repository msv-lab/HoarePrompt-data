You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i] and y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk with -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and coef is a list of None values, both of length n.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:

            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list where each element is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding `visited` element was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is the total number of nodes processed in the last iteration where `bipartite` was True and `tot` was not 0, `bipartite` is True if the graph is bipartite, otherwise it is False, `ok` is True if the graph is bipartite and there was at least one node processed, otherwise it is False.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list where each element is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where each element is 1 if the corresponding `visited` element was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is the total number of nodes processed in the last iteration where `bipartite` was True and `tot` was not 0, `bipartite` is True if the graph is bipartite, otherwise it is False, and `ok` indicates whether the graph is bipartite and there was at least one node processed. If `ok` is True, the graph is bipartite and there was at least one node processed. If `ok` is False, either the graph is not bipartite or there were no nodes processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a set of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), using a list `visited` to track which disks have been processed and a list `coef` for additional calculations. It likely modifies these lists in place or returns a result based on the processing of the disks.
