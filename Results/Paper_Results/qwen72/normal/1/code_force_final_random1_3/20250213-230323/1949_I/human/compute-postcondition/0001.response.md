Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of None values of length n, y and r are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), y[i] and r[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk with -10^9 ≤ y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and coef is a list of None values, both of length n.**
