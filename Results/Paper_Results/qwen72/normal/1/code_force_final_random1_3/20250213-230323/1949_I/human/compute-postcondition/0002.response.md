Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of None values of length n, y is a list of None values of length n, r is a list of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9, visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and coef is a list of None values, both of length n.**

Explanation:
- The variable `y` was originally a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks.
- The code `y = [None] * n` reassigns `y` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
