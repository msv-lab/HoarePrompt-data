Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list of False values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of None values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list where the element at index `0` is True if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where the element at index `0` is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is either True or False depending on the graph properties discovered during the DFS if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains True, `ok` is True if either its original value was True or if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list where the element at index `0` is True if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, and the element at index `1` is True if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where the element at index `0` is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, and the element at index `1` is 1 if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is 1 if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains 0, `bipartite` is True if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains True, `ok` is True if either its original value was True or if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `y` is a list of integers, `r` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list where the element at index 0 is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, the element at index 1 is True if it was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, and the element at index 2 is True if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where the element at index 0 is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, the element at index 1 is 1 if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, and the element at index 2 is 1 if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, `tot` is 1 if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains 0, `bipartite` is True if `visited[2]` was initially False, otherwise it remains True, `ok` is True if either its original value was True or if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
