Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]; `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing `[i]`; `c` is 1; `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0; the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than `x`.** 

The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
