Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]; `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing `[i]`; `c` is 0; `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0; the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `ind`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than `x` is still valid.
