Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]. `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. If `a[1]` is greater than `x`, `ind` is a list containing `[1]` and `c` is 1. If `a[i]` (where `i` is 2) is greater than `x`, `ind` is updated to `[1, 2]` and `c` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ind` remains an empty list and `c` is 1. `i` is 2. We do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
