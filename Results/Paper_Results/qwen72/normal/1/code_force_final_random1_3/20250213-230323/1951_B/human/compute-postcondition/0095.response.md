Output State: **The first and the last elements of `s` are swapped back to their original positions if `p` is 0. Otherwise, `s[p]` is now equal to the original `s[0]`, and `s[k - 1]` is now equal to the original `s[p]`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `p`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `h`, and `z`) remain unchanged, and `ans1` is 0. Additionally, `z` is now 0.**
