The value of `ans1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions, `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the third element of `s`, `ans1` is 1 + the value of `ans1` before the increment, `z` is 1 if the conditions were met in the previous iteration.**
