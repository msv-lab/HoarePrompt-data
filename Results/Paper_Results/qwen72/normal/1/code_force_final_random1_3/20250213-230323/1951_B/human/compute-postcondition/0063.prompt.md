Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions, `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions, `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the first element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. Similarly, `z` is 1 if `z` was 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `z` remains 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions, `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `i` == `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` and the second element of `s` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0, and `z` is 1. If `i` > `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `z` was 1 and the second element of `s` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `z` was 0 or the second element of `s` is greater than `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a list of integers read from input with at least two elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped back to their original positions, `h` is now the value of `s[k-1]` after the swap, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` until the loop breaks or ends, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the third element of `s`. If `i` == `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is 1. If `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` ≤ `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is set to 2 and `z` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
