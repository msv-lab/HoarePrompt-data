Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]; `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing `[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains an empty list; `c` is 2; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
