Output State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from the input, but the first element (`s[0]`) and the `k-1`-th element (`s[k-1]`) have been swapped. `n` and `k` retain their original values, `i` will have iterated through each element of `s`, `ans1` will be incremented based on the conditions described, `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` equals `h`, otherwise it will remain 0, `ans` is 0, `h` is now equal to the value of `s[0]` (which was originally the value of `s[k-1]`).**
