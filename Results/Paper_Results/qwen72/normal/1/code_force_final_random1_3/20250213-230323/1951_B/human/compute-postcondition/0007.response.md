Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]; `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing `[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains an empty list; `c` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 0; `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.***
