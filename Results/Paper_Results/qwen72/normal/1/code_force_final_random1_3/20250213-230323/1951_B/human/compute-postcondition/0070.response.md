Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `s` is a new list of integers read from input, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) are in their original positions, `h` is the value of `s[k-1]` in its original position, `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` before breaking out of the loop or reaching the end of `s[1:]`, `ans` is 0, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of `s` that was processed before the loop broke or ended, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.**
