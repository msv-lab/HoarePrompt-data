Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of elements at even indices), `i` is 2 * n - 2, and the loop has one fewer iteration remaining.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
