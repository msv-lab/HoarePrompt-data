The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and sorts the resulting list. This list is then assigned to the variable `l`. The initial state includes `t` being an integer within the range 1 to 5000, and `n` being an input integer. The execution of the code does not affect `t` or `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
