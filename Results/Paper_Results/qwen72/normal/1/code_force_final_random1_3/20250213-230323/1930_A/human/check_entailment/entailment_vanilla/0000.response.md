### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have `2n` integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform `n` moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then removing both integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the score.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always try to pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible.
   - Sorting the list of integers helps in achieving this because the smallest integers will be at the beginning of the sorted list.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adds it to the score. This is because the sorted list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, and the minimum of each pair is the first element in each pair.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - It correctly iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element and adding it to the score.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
