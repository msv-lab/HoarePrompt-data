Reasoning:  
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of 2n integers.
3. **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because we need to pair the smallest elements together to maximize the minimum value in each pair.
4. **Calculating the Score**: The function iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first element. This ensures that we are always adding the smaller of the two paired elements, which maximizes the score.
5. **Outputting the Result**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.

The key insight here is that sorting the list and then summing every second element starting from the first element guarantees that we are always pairing the smallest available elements, which maximizes the score.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given examples.
