Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the last input, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*n-2]`), and the loop has completed all its iterations for all `t` test cases.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed for all `t` test cases, the variable `t` still represents the number of test cases, `n` holds the value of the last input integer for the number of pairs, `l` is the sorted list of integers from the last input, and `score` contains the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the last `l`. The loop has successfully completed all its iterations for each of the `t` test cases.
