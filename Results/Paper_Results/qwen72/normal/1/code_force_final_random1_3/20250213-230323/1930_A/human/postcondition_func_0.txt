The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list. It then prints the calculated sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state is maintained.
