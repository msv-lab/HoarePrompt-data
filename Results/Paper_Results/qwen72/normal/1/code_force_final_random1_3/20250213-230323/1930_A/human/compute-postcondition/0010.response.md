Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of elements at even indices), `i` is 2 * n - 2.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `l` with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This means it adds every second element of `l` to `score`.
- After the loop completes, `score` will contain the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2).
- The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 2` after the last iteration, which is the last even index before the loop terminates.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
