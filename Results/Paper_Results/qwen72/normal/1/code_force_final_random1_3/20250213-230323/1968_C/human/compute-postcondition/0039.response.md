To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `a`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where:
     - `a[0]` is 1000.
     - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Construction of List `a`:**
   - The first element of `a` is 1000.
   - Each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

3. **Unpacking the List `a`:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given the above, let's construct the list `a` step by step:

- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

Therefore, the list `a` will contain the following elements:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print these elements separated by spaces.

Output: **1000 1000 + x[0] 1000 + x[0] + x[1] ... 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
