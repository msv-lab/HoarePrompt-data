Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`, and `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`x`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: After the loop completes, `a[0]` remains 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element in `x`, `x[i-1]`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will have iterated from 1 to `n-1`, so after the loop, `i` will be `n-1`.
