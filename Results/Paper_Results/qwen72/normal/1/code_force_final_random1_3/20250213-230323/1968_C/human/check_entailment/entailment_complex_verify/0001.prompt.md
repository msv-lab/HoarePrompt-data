You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, representing the number of elements in the array a. The array x contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n, where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers provided by the user, and `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the final state of `a` for each test case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it constructs a list `a` of length `n` where the first element is always 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `x` containing `n-1` integers.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0 initially.

3. **Setting the First Element:**
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 1000. This is a valid choice because it ensures that `a[0]` is greater than any possible value of `x[i]` (since `1 \le x_i \le 500`).

4. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `1 \le i < n`), the value is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`, making the remainder `x[i-1]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The constructed array `a` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Constraints:**
  - The constraints are respected: `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` and `1 \le x_i \le 500`.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.

- **Correctness:**
  - The construction of `a` ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
  - The initial value of `a[0]` being 1000 is a safe choice because it is greater than any possible value of `x[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the conditions are satisfied for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
