The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `x`.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `x` is now a list of integers derived from the user input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers from the user input.**
