Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 except `a[0]` which is 1000, and `i` is `n-1`. The value of `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `a[0]` which is 1000.
- The variable `i` is set to `n-1`.
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is `n-1`, the index `i - 1` is `n-2`.
- Therefore, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
