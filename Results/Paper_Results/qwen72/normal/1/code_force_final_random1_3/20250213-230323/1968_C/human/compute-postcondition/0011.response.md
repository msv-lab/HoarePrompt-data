The code snippet updates the list `a` at index `i` (which is 3) by setting `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a[3]` will be updated to the value of `a[2]` plus `x[2]`.

- `a[0]` is 1000
- `a[1]` is 1000 + `x[0]`
- `a[2]` is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`
- `a[3]` will be updated to `a[2]` + `x[2]`, which is (1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`) + `x[2]`

Therefore, the new value of `a[3]` is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1000, the second element set to 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element set to 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the fourth element set to 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, `i` is 3.**
