The only objects in the loop head are the variable `gap` and the list `even`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `even`. If `even` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least two elements, `gap` is the second element in `even`. For the loop to execute one more time, `even` must have at least three elements, and `gap` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least three elements, `gap` is the third element in `even`, `ans` is increased by 6, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`**
