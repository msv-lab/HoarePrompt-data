Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least `x + 1` elements, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[x] - a[x - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[x] - a[x - 1]) // 2`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to it. Given that `i` is `x`, the value added to `ans` is `(a[x] - a[x - 1]) // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
