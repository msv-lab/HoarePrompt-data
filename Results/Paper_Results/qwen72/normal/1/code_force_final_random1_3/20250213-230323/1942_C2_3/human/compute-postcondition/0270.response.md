The code snippet `ans += gap` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `gap` to it. Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
   - `y` is the third integer from the input.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`.
   - `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`.
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
   - `gap` is the next element in the `odd` list.
   - `ans` is `x - 2 + gap`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `ans += gap` adds the value of `gap` to `ans`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `ans` is now `x - 2 + gap + gap`, which simplifies to `x - 2 + 2 * gap`.

4. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in the `odd` list, `ans` is `x - 2 + 2 * gap`.**
