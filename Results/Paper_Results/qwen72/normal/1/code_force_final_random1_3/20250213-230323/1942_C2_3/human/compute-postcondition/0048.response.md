Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.** 

Explanation: The code initializes `tmp` as an empty list, which overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The new state reflects that `tmp` is now an empty list, while the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, and `ans` remain as specified in the initial state.
