Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, n is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n].
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    ans = x - 2
    st = set(a)
    a.sort()
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
            ans += 1
    odd = []
    even = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
            odd.append(gap)
        elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
            even.append(gap)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    for gap in odd:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    for gap in even:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is reduced by 1 from its original value, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is the last element in `even`, `odd` is a sorted list of odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of even gaps between consecutive elements in `a`, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `even`, `y` is now `y - sum(gap // 2 for gap in even)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is 0, `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, and `a` is now sorted, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `even`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop, `ans` is `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop plus `sum(2 * (y - gap // 2) for gap in odd) + sum(gap for gap in odd) + sum(even)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is as follows:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
