Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). The list `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers within the range [1, n]. `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `i` is `x - 1`. `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose differences are even and where `y` was sufficient to cover the additional positions. `ans` is the final value after all the updates based on the conditions in the loop. If \(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2\), then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0\) and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` includes the value \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2\), and `ans` is increased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\).**
