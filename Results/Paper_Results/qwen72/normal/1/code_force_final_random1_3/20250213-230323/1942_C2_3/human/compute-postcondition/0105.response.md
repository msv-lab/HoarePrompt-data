The provided code appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `tmp` was initially an empty list. After the code executes, `tmp` contains one element, which is the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tt`, `ii`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing one element equal to `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
