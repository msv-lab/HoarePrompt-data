Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, the function computes a value `cons` which represents the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, where `sx` is the sum of certain calculated values based on the input list. The function prints the computed `cons` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is 0, and the final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case. **
