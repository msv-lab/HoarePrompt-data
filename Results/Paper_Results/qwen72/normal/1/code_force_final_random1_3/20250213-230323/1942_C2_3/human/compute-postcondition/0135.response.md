Output State: **`x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `y * 2`, `i` is equal to the first element of `val`, the values of `cons`, `y`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `y` is less than `c`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`x`, `c`, `val`, `i`, `cons`, `y`, `t`, `n`, and `l`) retain their initial values or conditions.
- The condition that `y` is less than `c` remains unchanged.
