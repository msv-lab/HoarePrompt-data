Output State: **`x` must be at least 0, `c` is the last calculated value of `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order, `sx` is the sum of all `i` values processed in the loop plus the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop, `y` is the original `y` minus the sum of all `c` values calculated in the loop, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- `cons` is updated to the value of `x + sx - 2`.
- All other variables (`x`, `c`, `val`, `sx`, `y`, `t`, `n`, and `l`) retain their previous values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
