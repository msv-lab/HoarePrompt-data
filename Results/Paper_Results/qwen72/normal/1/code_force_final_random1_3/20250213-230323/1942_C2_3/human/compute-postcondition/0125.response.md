The code snippet appends the value of \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) // 2\) to the list `tmp`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Calculation of the New Element:**
   - `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `n` is the new first input integer.
   - `a[len(a) - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - The expression \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) // 2\) calculates the integer division of the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negation of the last element of `a` by 2.

2. **Appending to `tmp`:**
   - The calculated value is appended to the list `tmp`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The list `tmp` is updated with the new element.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of even differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were less than or equal to `y` and now includes the value \((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) // 2\), and `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, plus the sum of the half-differences of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with an even difference that were less than or equal to `y`. Additionally, the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of `((a[0] + n - a[\text{len}(a) - 1]) % 2)` is 0, and the current value of `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
