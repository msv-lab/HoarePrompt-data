Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `ans` remains `x - 2`. Additionally, `gap` is greater than 0 and `gap` is even.**
