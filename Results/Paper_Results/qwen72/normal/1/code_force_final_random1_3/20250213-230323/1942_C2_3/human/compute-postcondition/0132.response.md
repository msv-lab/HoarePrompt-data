Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `tt` is equal to `t`, `ii` is `t - 1`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of even differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, plus the sum of the half-differences of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with an even difference that were less than or equal to `y`, plus the value of `y`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`n`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`x`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`y`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`a`**: Remains a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- **`tt`**: After all iterations, `tt` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has run the required number of times.
- **`ii`**: After all iterations, `ii` is `t - 1`, indicating the last iteration index.
- **`i`**: Within each iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- **`tmp`**: Contains the middle points of even differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were less than or equal to `y`.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` is calculated as the sum of `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, plus the sum of the half-differences of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with an even difference that were less than or equal to `y`, plus the remaining value of `y`. This value is then printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.
