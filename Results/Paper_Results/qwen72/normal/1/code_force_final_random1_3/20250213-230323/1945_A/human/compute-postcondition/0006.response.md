The value of `b` is incremented by the value of `c`. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the next line in the input file and are within the range 0 to 10^9, the new value of `b` is `b + c`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and has been updated to `b + c`, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9.**
