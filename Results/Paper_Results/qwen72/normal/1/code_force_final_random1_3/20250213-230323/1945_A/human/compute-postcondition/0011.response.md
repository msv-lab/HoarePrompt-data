To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `s` is the next element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.
- `a` is the first integer in `s`.
- `b` is the second integer in `s` plus the third integer in `s`.
- `c` is the third integer in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `s`**:
   - `[*open(0)][1:]` reads the contents of file descriptor 0 (standard input) and converts it into a list, then takes all elements except the first one.
   - For simplicity, let's assume the input is a single line of space-separated integers, e.g., "1 2 3". This means `s` will be `['1', '2', '3']`.

2. **Extracting Values from `s`**:
   - `a` is the first integer in `s`, so `a = int('1') = 1`.
   - `b` is the second integer in `s` plus the third integer in `s`, so `b = int('2') + int('3') = 2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `c` is the third integer in `s`, so `c = int('3') = 3`.

3. **Evaluating the Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - First, evaluate `-b // 3`:
     - `-b` is `-5`.
     - `-5 // 3` is `-2` (integer division).
   - Next, evaluate `a - -b // 3`:
     - `a - -2` is `1 - -2 = 1 + 2 = 3`.
   - Now, evaluate `b % 3`:
     - `b % 3` is `5 % 3 = 2`.
   - Finally, evaluate the condition `c < b % 3`:
     - `c < 2` is `3 < 2`, which is `False`.

4. **Selecting the Result**:
   - The expression `(3, -1)[False]` will select the second element of the tuple because `False` is equivalent to `0` in Python.
   - Therefore, the result is `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
