The value of `b` is incremented by the value of `c`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers and their values are taken from the second line of the input, the new value of `b` is `b + c`. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is now `b + c`, `c` is a non-negative integer, and 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.**
