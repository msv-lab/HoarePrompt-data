The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input (stdin), ignoring the first line. For each subsequent line, it parses three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts (`a`), extroverts (`b`), and universals (`c`). It then updates `b` by adding `c` to it and prints a calculated value based on the updated values of `a` and `b`. The printed value is determined by the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`, which evaluates to `a - -b // 3` if `c` is less than `b % 3`, otherwise it prints `-1`. After processing all lines, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output (stdout). The final state of the program is that the last values of `a`, `b`, and `c` read from the input are retained, but these are not returned or used outside the function.
