The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` reads the second line of the input (`s`) and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. This means that `a`, `b`, and `c` now hold the integer values from the second line of the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the integer values from the second line of the input, and they are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The input has at least two lines.**
