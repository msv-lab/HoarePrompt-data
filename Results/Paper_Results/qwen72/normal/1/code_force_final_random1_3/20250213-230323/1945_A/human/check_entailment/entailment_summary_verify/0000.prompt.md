You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input (stdin), ignoring the first line. For each subsequent line, it parses three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts (`a`), extroverts (`b`), and universals (`c`). It then updates `b` by adding `c` to it and prints a calculated value based on the updated values of `a` and `b`. The printed value is determined by the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`, which evaluates to `a - -b // 3` if `c` is less than `b % 3`, otherwise it prints `-1`. After processing all lines, the function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output (stdout). The final state of the program is that the last values of `a`, `b`, and `c` read from the input are retained, but these are not returned or used outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts cannot be fully accommodated even with the help of universals. For example, consider the input `1 4 1`:

- There is 1 introvert, which requires 1 tent.
- There are 4 extroverts, which require 4 / 3 = 1.33 tents, but since we can't split tents, we need 2 tents to accommodate all extroverts.
- There is 1 universal, which can help fill the remaining spots in the tents.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case, whereas the correct output should be `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining extrovert and the universal).

The issue lies in the logic of the program, specifically in how it handles the distribution of universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. The program does not correctly account for the possibility of using universals to complete the required tent configurations for extroverts.
