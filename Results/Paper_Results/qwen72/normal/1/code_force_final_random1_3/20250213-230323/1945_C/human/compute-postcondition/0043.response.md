To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `ele` and the list `lst`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Objects**: The loop head involves `ele` and `lst`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `lst` contains at least one element.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string
- `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`
- `pk` is set to `n / 2`
- `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is 100000000
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`
- `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`
- `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the conditions were met during the loop if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, `lst` contains only those indices where the conditions were met.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.
- The value of `ele` will be the elements of `lst` as the loop iterates.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, `lst` must have at least one element. The initial state of `ele` is not relevant until the loop starts, but it will take on the values from `lst` as the loop progresses.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least one element**.
