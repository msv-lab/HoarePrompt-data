### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup**: The function initializes variables to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's, and sets up a list `lst` to store potential positions for the road.

3. **Iterating Through Houses**: The function iterates through the houses (up to `n-1`), updating the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the current position. It calculates the percentage of satisfied residents on both sides and checks if the conditions are met (at least 50% satisfaction on both sides).

4. **Finding Optimal Position**: The function keeps track of all valid positions in `lst` and then finds the position closest to the middle of the village (`n/2`). It handles ties by selecting the smallest index.

5. **Edge Cases**: If no valid positions are found, the function checks the overall satisfaction of the entire village and decides whether to place the road before the first house (0) or after the last house (`n`).

6. **Output**: The function prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is set to `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is correct because the goal is to find the position closest to the middle, and `n / 2` works for both even and odd `n`.

- **Percentage Calculation**: The percentage calculation is done using integer division, which is appropriate for this problem.

- **Handling No Valid Positions**: The function correctly handles the case where no valid positions are found by checking the overall satisfaction of the entire village.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the road is placed in the optimal position according to the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
