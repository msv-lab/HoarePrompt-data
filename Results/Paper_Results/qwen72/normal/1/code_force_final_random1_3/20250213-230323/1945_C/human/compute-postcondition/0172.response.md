Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0': `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1 or 2, and `lst` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains [1].***
