Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, and `z` remain unchanged, and `final` is a list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
- For each element `elem` in `lst`, if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `elem` is added to the list `final`.
- After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference from `pk`.
- The values of `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `mini`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, and `z` remain as described in the initial state, with the exception that `final` is updated based on the loop's logic.
