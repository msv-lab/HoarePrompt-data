Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 200 // 2, `one` is 0, and `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1]. If `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100 // 2, `one` is 1 or 2, and `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1].**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `zero * 100 // 2`.
- If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2, so `zero_perc` becomes `2 * 100 // 2 = 100`.
- If `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 1, so `zero_perc` becomes `1 * 100 // 2 = 50`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
