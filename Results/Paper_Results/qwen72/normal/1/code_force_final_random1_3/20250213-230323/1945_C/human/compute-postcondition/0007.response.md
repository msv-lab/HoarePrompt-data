Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `n` is odd, `pk` is `n / 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is an input integer and is odd, `pk` will be a floating-point number (since dividing an odd integer by 2 results in a non-integer value). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
