The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- `pk` is `n / 2`
- `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is 100000000
- `i` is 2
- `zero` is 3 if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', or 1 if `s[1]` is not '0'
- `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `[2]`
- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`
- If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element
- If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)`:
- `lst` now contains the value `i + 1` appended to its existing elements.

Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, `lst` will now contain the value 3 appended to its existing elements.

Output State: **`one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 3 if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', or 1 if `s[1]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `[2, 3]`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, if `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element, if `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.**
