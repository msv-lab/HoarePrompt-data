The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, and the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', and `zero` is 1.**
