The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2.
- `lst` was initially [1] because `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were both greater than or equal to 50.

After appending `i + 1` to `lst`, the new value of `lst` is [1, 2].

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is \((o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)\), `lst` is [1, 2].**
