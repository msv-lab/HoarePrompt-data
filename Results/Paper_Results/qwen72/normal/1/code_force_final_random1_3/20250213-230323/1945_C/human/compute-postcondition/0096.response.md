Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 1, `one` is 1 if `s[1]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 1)`, `lst` is a list containing `[1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, so if `s[1]` is '0', `zero` becomes 2; otherwise, `zero` becomes 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
