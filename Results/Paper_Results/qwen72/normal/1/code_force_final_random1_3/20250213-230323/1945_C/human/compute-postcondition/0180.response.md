Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0' or 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is 100 if `s[i]` is '0' or 33 if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' or 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1, 3] if `s[i]` is '0' or [1, 2, 3] if `s[i]` is not '0'. Otherwise, `lst` remains [1].***
