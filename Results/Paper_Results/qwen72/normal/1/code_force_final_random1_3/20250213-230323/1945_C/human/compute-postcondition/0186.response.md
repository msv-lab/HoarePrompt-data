The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least one element, and `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element, and `ele` will be the next (second) element in `lst`.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, the values of `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, and `final` remain unchanged, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`.**
