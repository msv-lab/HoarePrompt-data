Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, if `s[0]` is '0' then `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100; otherwise if `s[0]` is '1' then `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is \((o - \text{one}) \times 100 // (n - 1)\). If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [1]; otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
