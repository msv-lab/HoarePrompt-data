Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and is even, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`.** 

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n / 2`. Since `n` is an even input integer, `pk` will be a specific value that is half of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
