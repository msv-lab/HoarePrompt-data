To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `lst`. The loop will execute if `lst` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst` is not empty.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- `pk` is `n / 2`
- `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`
- `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`
- `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50
- `final` is an empty list

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one index `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list**
