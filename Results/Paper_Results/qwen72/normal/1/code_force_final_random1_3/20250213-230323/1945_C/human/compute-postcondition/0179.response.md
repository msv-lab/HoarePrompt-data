The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. The `append` method adds this value to the list `lst`. Depending on the value of `s[i]`, the initial state of `lst` could be either `[1]` or `[1, 2]`. After appending 3, the new value of `lst` will be `[1, 3]` if `s[i]` is '0', or `[1, 2, 3]` if `s[i]` is not '0'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0' or 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is 100 if `s[i]` is '0' or 33 if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' or 2 if `s[i]` is not '0', `lst` is [1, 3] if `s[i]` is '0' or [1, 2, 3] if `s[i]` is not '0'.**
