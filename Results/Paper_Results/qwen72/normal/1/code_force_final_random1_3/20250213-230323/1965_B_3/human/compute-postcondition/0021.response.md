The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `lk`. The loop condition is `i < lk - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `lk` must still be greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- `lk` is at least 2.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `lk` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing `[1]`. `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1.**
