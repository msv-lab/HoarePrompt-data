### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - When `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns `1\n2`, which is correct because the only possible subsequence is `[2]`, and it does not sum to `1`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence, and no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - When `k != 1`:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)` to cover the remaining range of `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly formats and prints the sequence for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the specified conditions and constraints correctly. It generates a sequence that meets the requirements for both special and general cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
