The code snippet writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. Since the value returned by `func_14()` has already been written to the standard output according to the initial state, this action is effectively repeated. The function `func_10()` returning a value greater than 0 is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output twice.**
