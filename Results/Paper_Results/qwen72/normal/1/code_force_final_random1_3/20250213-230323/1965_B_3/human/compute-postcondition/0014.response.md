Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. The current value of `k` is 1. `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. `i` is `l-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = l-1`, appending `2 ** i` to the list `ans` for each iteration.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain the values `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `l-1` after the last iteration.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
