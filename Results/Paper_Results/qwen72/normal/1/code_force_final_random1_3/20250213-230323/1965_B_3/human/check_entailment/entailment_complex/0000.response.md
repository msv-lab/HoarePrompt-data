### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The function `func_14()` generates the required sequence based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `k` is 1:
     - If `n` is 2, it returns the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - Otherwise, it generates a sequence starting with 2 and 3, followed by powers of 2 up to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k` is not 1:
     - It generates a sequence starting with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
     - It then appends powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\).

3. **Output:**
   - The function `func_15()` writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output for each test case.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - The sequence generated ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
  - For `k = 1`, the sequence avoids 1 and includes 2 and 3, ensuring no subsequence sums to 1.
  - For `k > 1`, the sequence includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, which are chosen to avoid any subsequence summing to `k`.

- **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
  - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum up to the largest power of 2 included.
  - Additional elements like `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
