The code snippet `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation and assigns this binary string (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`.
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
- `k` is not equal to 1.

After executing the code:
- The variable `bk` is assigned the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
