Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing `[1, 2]`. `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 1, `2 ** i` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `ans` now contains `[1, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
