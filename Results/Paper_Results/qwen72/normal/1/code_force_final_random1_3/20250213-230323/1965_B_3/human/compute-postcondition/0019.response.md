To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions involving the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and implicitly `range(lk - 1)`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and is not something we need to adjust manually.
2. **Variable `lk`**: The loop will execute if `lk - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `lk` must be at least 2. Since `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, this implies that `bk` must have at least 2 characters. Given that `k` is not equal to 1, the smallest possible value for `k` is 2, which has a binary representation of "10" (length 2).

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `lk` must be at least 2, and `i` should start from 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is an empty list. `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is 0.**
