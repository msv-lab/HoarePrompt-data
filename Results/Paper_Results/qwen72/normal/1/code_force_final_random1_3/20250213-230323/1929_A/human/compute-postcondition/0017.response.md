The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers. The function accepts an implicit set of parameters for each test case, including:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such functions would return or print some result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It is expected to return or print a result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a`.**
