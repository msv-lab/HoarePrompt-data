Reasoning:  
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. According to the problem statement, the beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element to the last. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the program provided does not follow this strategy. Instead, it sorts the array and then simply prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). This approach calculates the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, but it does not correctly compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements as required by the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Since the program does not perform the correct computation, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
