Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
- `ntest` must be greater than 2.
- `itest` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: The list `a` is described as a sorted list of integers derived from the input. Since it is sorted, the smallest element in the list is `a[0]` and the largest element is `a[len(a) - 1]`.

2. **Expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**:
   - `a[len(a) - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`, which is the largest element.
   - `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`, which is the smallest element.
   - The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] (where a[len(a) - 1] is the largest element in the sorted list `a` and a[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list `a`)**
