Reasoning:  
The program's logic is to sort the array and then calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array. However, this approach does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. 

To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences. This is because the largest differences will contribute the most to the total beauty. However, the current program only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
