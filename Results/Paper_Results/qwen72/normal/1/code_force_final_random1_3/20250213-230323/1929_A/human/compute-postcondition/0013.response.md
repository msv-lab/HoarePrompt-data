The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `ntest` must be greater than 2
- `itest` is 2

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ntest` must be greater than 2, `itest` is 2.**
