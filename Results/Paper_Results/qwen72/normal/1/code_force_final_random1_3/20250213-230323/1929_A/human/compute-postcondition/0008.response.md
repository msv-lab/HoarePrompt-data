The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `ntest` must be greater than 1
- `itest` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The length of `a` is determined by the number of integers provided in the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `ntest`, and `itest` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1.**
