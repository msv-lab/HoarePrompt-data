Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `ntest` must be greater than 1.
- `itest` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This means the smallest element in the list is `a[0]` and the largest element in the list is `a[len(a) - 1]`.
2. **Expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**: This expression calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Calculation:
- `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`, which is the smallest element.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`, which is the largest element.
- The difference between these two elements is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

Output: **a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] (where a[len(a) - 1] is the largest element in the list `a` and a[0] is the smallest element in the list `a`)**
