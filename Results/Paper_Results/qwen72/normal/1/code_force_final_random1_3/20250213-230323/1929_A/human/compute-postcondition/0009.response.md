The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `t`, `n`, `ntest`, and `itest` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1.**
