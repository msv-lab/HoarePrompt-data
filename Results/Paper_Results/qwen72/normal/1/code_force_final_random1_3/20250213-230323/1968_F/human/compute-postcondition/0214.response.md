The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range `q`. The loop will execute `q` times regardless of the values of `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, `v2`, `l`, `r`, or `results`. Since the loop does not depend on these variables for its continuation, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the only object in the loop head is `_`, the state of `_` will increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is described in terms of `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, `v2`, `l`, `r`, and `results`, and these are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged for the purpose of the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, and `it2` is the index in `v2` such that `v2[it2]` is the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then the list `results` contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, either `it1` is equal to or greater than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`, and the list `results` contains the string 'NO'.**
