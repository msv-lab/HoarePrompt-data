The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each containing an array of integers and a set of queries. It reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the queries. For each query, it determines whether the XOR of the elements in the specified subarray is zero or if there exists a pair of indices within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR value. The function outputs 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise 'NO'. The output for each test case is followed by an empty line.
