Output State: **All variables retain their previous values, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.** 

This means that `t` remains greater than 0, `data` is still a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is still `7 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is still greater than 0, `q` is still greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is still a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is still a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is still a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is still a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional element at the end which is now 'YES'. `i` is still `n`, `l` is still `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is still `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is still `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is still the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`, `v2` is still the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is still the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is still the index in `v2` where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order minus 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
