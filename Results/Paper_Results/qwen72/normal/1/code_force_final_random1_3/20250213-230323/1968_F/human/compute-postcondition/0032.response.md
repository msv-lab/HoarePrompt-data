Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 6, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is `int(data[3])`, `a[2]` which is `int(data[4])`, and `a[3]` which is `int(data[5])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`. If `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `mp[pf[3]]` remains as a list containing `[3]`.***
