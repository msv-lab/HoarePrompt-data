To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should start at 1.

### Given State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `idx` is 3.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.
- Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is (0) and the value is a list containing a single element [0].

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` should start at 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0, each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is (0) and the value is a list containing a single element [0], `i` is 1**.
