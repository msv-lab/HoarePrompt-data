Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are populated with the integer values from `data[3]` to `data[3 + n - 1]`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where the prefix XOR equals that key.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index of the rightmost element in `v2` that is less than `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `7 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index of the rightmost element in `v2` that is less than `r`, `it2` is now `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, the string 'YES' is appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, the `results` list contains the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `9 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is now `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then the `results` list contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains the string 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
