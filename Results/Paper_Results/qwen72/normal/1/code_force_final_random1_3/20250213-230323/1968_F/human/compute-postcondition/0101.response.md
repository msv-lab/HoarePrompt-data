To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `a[1]` set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `pf[1]` set to `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}` depending on whether `pf[1]` is in `mp` or not, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, and `i` is 2.**
