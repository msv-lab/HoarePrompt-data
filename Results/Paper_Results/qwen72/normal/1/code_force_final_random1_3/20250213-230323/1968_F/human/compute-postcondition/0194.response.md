Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `6 + n + 4 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[1]` is `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2], pf[3]: [3]}`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list associated with the key `pf[3]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Before the code execution, `mp` contained the key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2]}`. After the code execution, `mp` now includes the key-value pair `{pf[3]: [3]}`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
