Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads input efficiently using `sys.stdin.read`, processes multiple test cases, and uses prefix XORs to determine if subarrays are "interesting" according to the problem's definition. The use of a dictionary (`mp`) to store indices of prefix XOR values and binary search (`bisect_left`) to find suitable segments for the queries is appropriate and efficient for the constraints given. The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting by verifying the existence of valid partitions through the prefix XOR values and their indices is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
