Output State: **After the loop has completed all iterations, the variable `idx` will be `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2 * q`, `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` will be `n`. The variables `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` will remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `q` times, and each iteration updates the `idx` variable by incrementing it by 2. Therefore, after `q` iterations, `idx` will be `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2 * q`.
- The `results` list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, followed by an additional empty string.
- The variable `i` will remain `n` as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` are not modified within the loop and will retain their initial values.
