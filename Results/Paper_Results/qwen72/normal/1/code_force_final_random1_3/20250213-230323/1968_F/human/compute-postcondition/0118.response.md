Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1])`, `r` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 2])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = int(data[idx + 1])` assigns the integer value of the element in `data` at the index `idx + 1` to the variable `r`.
- The initial value of `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1`.
- Therefore, the new value of `r` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 2])`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
