Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0, each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is (0) and the value is a list containing a single element [0].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 4, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[3])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is `int(data[3])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[4])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 2, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp[pf[2]]` is a list containing `[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 6, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is `int(data[3])`, `a[2]` which is `int(data[4])`, and `a[3]` which is `int(data[5])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` is a list containing `[3, 3]` if it was initially `[3]` or `[3]` if it was initially an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
