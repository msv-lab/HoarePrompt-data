Postcondition: ***`v2` is updated to the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`. `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order. `it2` is the index just before the position where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, then `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes the string 'NO'. All other variables remain unchanged.***
