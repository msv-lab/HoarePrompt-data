Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is assigned the value `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, all other variables (`v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `mp`, `pf`, `results`) remain unchanged. If `x` is 0, `results` now contains one additional element 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`.
- `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`.
- `idx` is incremented by 2.
- `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, which means `v1` is set to the list associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`.
- All other variables (`v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `mp`, `pf`, `results`) remain unchanged.
- If `x` is 0, `results` now contains one additional element 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration.
