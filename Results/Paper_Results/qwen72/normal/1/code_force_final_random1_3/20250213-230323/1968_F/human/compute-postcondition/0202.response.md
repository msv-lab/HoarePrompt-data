Output State: **`t` remains greater than 0. `data` is still the original list of strings obtained from the input. `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n - 4]` and must be greater than 0. `q` must be greater than 0. `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1])`. `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`. `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs. `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and now contains an additional 'YES' at the end. `i` is `n`. `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`. `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the current value of `x` is 0.**
