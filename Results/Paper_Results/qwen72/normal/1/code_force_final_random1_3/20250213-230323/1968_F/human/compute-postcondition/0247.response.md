Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `idx` will be `3 + t * (n + 2 * q + 2)` after the loop has executed all iterations.
- `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, followed by `t` empty strings at the end.
- The variables `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` will remain unchanged for each iteration but will be reset for the next test case.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`results` List**: 
   - The `results` list contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, followed by `t` empty strings.
   - The number of 'YES' or 'NO' entries depends on the number of queries processed.
   - The `t` empty strings are added at the end of the `results` list.

2. **`'\n'.join(results)`**:
   - This joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that each element in the `results` list will be printed on a new line.

### Final Output:
- The output will be a series of lines, where each line is either 'YES', 'NO', or an empty line.
- The number of 'YES' or 'NO' lines will correspond to the number of queries processed.
- The number of empty lines will be equal to `t`.

### Example:
If `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', '', '', '']` (assuming `t = 3`), the output will be:
```
YES
NO
YES

```

### General Format:
Output: **'YES' or 'NO' for each query, followed by `t` empty lines**

So, the final answer is:
Output: **'YES' or 'NO' for each query, followed by `t` empty lines**
