Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a[3]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[3]` is set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` contains `[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `mp[pf[3]]`.
- Since `pf[3]` is not in `mp` initially, `mp[pf[3]]` starts as an empty list and becomes `[3]` after the append operation.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
