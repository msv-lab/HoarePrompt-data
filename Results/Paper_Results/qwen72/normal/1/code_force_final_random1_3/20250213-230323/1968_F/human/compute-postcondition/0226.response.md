Output State: **`v2` is updated to the list associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`. `it2` is the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. `results` now includes the string 'YES'. All other variables (`_`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`) remain unchanged.**
