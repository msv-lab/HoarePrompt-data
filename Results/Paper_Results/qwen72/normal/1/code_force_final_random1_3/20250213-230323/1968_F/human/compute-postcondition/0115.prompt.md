Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `a[1]` set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `pf[1]` set to `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}` depending on whether `pf[1]` is in `mp` or not, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `a[1]` set to `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `pf[1]` set to `a[1]` and `pf[2]` set to `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}` depending on whether `pf[1]` is in `mp` or not. If `pf[2]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list. `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is 2, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains `[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a[3]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[3]` is set to `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` contains `[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
