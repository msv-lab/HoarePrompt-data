Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `a[1]` set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `pf[1]` set to `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}` depending on whether `pf[1]` is in `mp` or not, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list associated with the key `pf[1]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Since `i` is 1, `pf[i]` is `pf[1]`, which is set to `a[1]` (an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`).
- If `pf[1]` was already a key in `mp`, its value (a list) is updated by appending 1 to it.
- If `pf[1]` was not a key in `mp`, it is added as a new key with the value `[1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
