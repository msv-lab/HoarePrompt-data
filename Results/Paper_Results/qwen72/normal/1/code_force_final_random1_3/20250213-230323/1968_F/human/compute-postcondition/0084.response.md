Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where the prefix XOR equals that key, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`data`**: Remains a list of strings obtained from the input, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`idx`**: After `q` iterations, `idx` will be incremented by `2 * q` (since `idx` is increased by 2 for each iteration). Therefore, the final value of `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q`.
- **`n`**: Remains the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`q`**: Remains the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains a list of `n + 1` integers, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pf`**: Remains a list of `n + 1` integers, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mp`**: Remains a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where the prefix XOR equals that key, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`results`**: Contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop. The length of `results` will be equal to `q`, and each element will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the conditions for that query were met.
