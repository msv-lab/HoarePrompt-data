Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is assigned the value `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, all other variables (`it1`, `it2`, `mp`, `pf`, `results`) remain unchanged. If `x` is 0, `results` now contains one additional element 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration.**
