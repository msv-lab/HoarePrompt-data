Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for large inputs and avoids multiple I/O operations.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array. This allows for quick computation of the XOR of any subarray using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**: The program maintains a dictionary (`mp`) where the keys are the prefix XOR values and the values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur. This helps in quickly checking if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program checks two conditions:
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero (`x == 0`), it directly returns 'YES'.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is non-zero, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there are indices within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR value. If such indices exist, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly formats the output, ensuring that each test case's results are separated by an empty line.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to handle all edge cases and efficiently processes the input and queries.

Correctness: **True**
