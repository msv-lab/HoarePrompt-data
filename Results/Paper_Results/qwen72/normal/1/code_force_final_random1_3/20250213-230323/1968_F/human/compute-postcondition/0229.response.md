The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the `range(q)` loop. This means that for each iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, starting from 0 up to `q-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is to increment `_` by 1. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`, `mp`, `pf`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, all other variables (`l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`, `mp`, `pf`) remain unchanged.**
