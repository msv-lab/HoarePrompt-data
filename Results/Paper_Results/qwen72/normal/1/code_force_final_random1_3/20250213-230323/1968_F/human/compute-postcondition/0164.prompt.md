Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional element at the end. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, the last element of `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'NO'. `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1])`, `r` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 2])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional element at the end. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, the last element in `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `x` (which is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) is 0, the last element in `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, the last element in `results` is 'NO'. `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`v2` is updated to the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`. `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order. `it2` is the index just before the position where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, then `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes the string 'NO'. All other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
