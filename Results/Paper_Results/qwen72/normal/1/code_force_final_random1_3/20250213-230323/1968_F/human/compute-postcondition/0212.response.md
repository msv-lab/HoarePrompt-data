Output State: **`it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index in `v2` such that `v2[it2]` is the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. Either `it1` is equal to or greater than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`. `results` now contains the string 'NO'.**
