Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is assigned the value `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, all other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `mp`, `pf`) remain unchanged. If `x` is 0, `results` now contains one additional element 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration.***
