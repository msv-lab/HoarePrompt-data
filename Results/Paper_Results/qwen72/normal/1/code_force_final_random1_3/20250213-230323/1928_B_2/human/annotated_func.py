def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value that was input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the user's input (which is split by spaces) into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each element into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from the standard input, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, which are the result of converting the input (a string of space-separated numbers) into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to be a string of space-separated numbers. It converts each number in the string into an integer and returns a list of these integers. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_4`. This function reads input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated list of integers, which it then converts to a list of integers and sorts.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, which are converted from a space-separated list of integers provided by the user through standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts them into a list of integers, sorts this list, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed to the function `func_5`. This function reads input from the standard input, expecting a line of space-separated strings.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the elements from the input line split by spaces, each element being a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain space-separated strings. The function returns a map object containing the elements from the input line, each element being a string. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the individual string elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_6` does not take any parameters.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list containing each character from the input string as individual elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the user input and returns a list where each element is a character from the input string. After the function concludes, the program has a list of characters derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_7` does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is an element from the input provided by the user, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string, sorts the resulting list of strings, and returns this sorted list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a sorted list of strings derived from the user's input.

    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`. The first element of `ans` is the first element of `arr`, the second element of `ans` is the product of the first two elements of `arr`, the third element of `ans` is the product of the first three elements of `arr`, and so on, up to the last element of `ans` which is the product of all elements in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes a list `arr` of positive integers as input and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements from the start of `arr` up to the current position. Specifically, the first element of `ans` is the first element of `arr`, the second element of `ans` is the product of the first two elements of `arr`, and so on, until the last element of `ans` which is the product of all elements in `arr`. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers. `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first. `tem` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`. The loop variable `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
