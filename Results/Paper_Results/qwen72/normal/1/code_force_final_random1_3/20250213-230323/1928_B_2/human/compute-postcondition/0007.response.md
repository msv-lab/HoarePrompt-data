The value of `tem` is calculated as `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`. The `ans` list, which initially contains the last element of `arr`, now has `tem` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**
