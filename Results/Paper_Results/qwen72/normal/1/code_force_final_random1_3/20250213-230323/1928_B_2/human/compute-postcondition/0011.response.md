Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers. `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first. `tem` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`. The loop variable `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `ans` will contain the products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, where each element in `ans` is the product of all elements from that position to the end of `arr`. The variable `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr`, and the loop variable `i` will be -1, showing that the loop has fully executed.
