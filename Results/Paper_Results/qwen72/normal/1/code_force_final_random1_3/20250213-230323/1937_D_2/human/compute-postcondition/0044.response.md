Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, the formula becomes `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `j`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`) remain unchanged.
