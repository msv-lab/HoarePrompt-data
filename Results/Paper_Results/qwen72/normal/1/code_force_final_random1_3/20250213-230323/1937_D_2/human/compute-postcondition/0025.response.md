Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is [0, 1, 2], `A` is [0, 1, 3], and `x` is 3 if `s[1]` is '>'; otherwise, `idx_A` is [2] and `A` is [0, 0].** 

Explanation:
- The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `idx_A`.
- If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` was initially [0, 1], and after appending `i`, it becomes [0, 1, 2].
- If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` was initially an empty list, and after appending `i`, it becomes [2].
- The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, and `x` remain unchanged.
