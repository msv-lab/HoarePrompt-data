Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `i` is initialized to `0`.
- The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.
- The print statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.

Given that `i` is `0` and the character at index `0` of `s` is '<', the expression `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **1**
