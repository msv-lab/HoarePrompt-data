Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- `a` is `A[0]`.
- The character at position `i` in `s` is '>'.
- `l` is less than `r`.
- `x` is `r - 2`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `a`**:
   - `a` is `A[0]`, which is the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered at the first position, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
   - Since `i` is `0` and the character at position `i` is '>', `A[0]` is the count of '>' characters at position `0` adjusted by its position and the number of previous '>' characters.
   - Given that `i` is `0` and the character is '>', `A[0]` is simply the count of '>' characters at position `0`, which is `1`.

2. **Determine `b`**:
   - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
   - `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
   - `r - 1` is the index of the last '<' character in the reversed list `idx_B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the index of the last '<' character in the original string `s`.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - Therefore, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (0 + 1) = idx_B[r - 1]`.

3. **Calculate the Expression**:
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:
     - `a` is `1`.
     - `b` is `idx_B[r - 1]`.
     - `i` is `0`.
     - The expression becomes: `1 * 2 + idx_B[r - 1] * 2 + 0 + 1 = 2 + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] + 1 = 3 + 2 * idx_B[r - 1]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of the expression `3 + 2 * idx_B[r - 1]`.

Output: **3 + 2 * idx_B[r - 1]** (where `idx_B[r - 1]` is the index of the last '<' character in the string `s`).
