Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`. The list `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters. The list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`s`**: The original string `s` remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: The length of `s` remains the same.
- **`A`**: This list contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters. Each element in `A` represents the value calculated based on the position and the count of previous '>' characters.
- **`idx_A`**: This list contains the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`. Each index in `idx_A` corresponds to the position of a '>' character in `s`.

For example, if `s = "><><>"`, then:
- `A` will be `[0, 1, 1, 2, 4]`.
- `idx_A` will be `[1, 3, 4]`.

This means:
- At index 1, the first '>' is encountered, so `A` becomes `[0, 1]` and `idx_A` becomes `[1]`.
- At index 3, the second '>' is encountered, so `A` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 2]` and `idx_A` becomes `[1, 3]`.
- At index 4, the third '>' is encountered, so `A` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 2, 4]` and `idx_A` becomes `[1, 3, 4]`.
