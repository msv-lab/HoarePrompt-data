Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list containing [0]. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing [0]. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, where `x` is calculated as `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.**
