Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, and it is given that `n` is greater than 2.

2. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to `2`.

3. **Calculate `n - i`**:
   - Since `i` is `2`, the expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 2`.

4. **Print the result**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `n - 2`.
   - The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Output: **n - 2 (where n is the length of the string s)**
