The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `l` is greater than 0, so `l - 1` is a valid index for the list `A`. The value of `a` is now the value at index `l - 1` in the list `A`.

Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1, `a` is `A[l - 1]`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.**
