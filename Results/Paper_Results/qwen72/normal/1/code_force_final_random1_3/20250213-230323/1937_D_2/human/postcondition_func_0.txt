The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and calculates the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string. It processes the string to compute cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous occurrences. The function prints the minimum number of swaps needed for each character position in the string to achieve a balanced state, where no '<' character appears before a '>' character without being matched. The original string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
