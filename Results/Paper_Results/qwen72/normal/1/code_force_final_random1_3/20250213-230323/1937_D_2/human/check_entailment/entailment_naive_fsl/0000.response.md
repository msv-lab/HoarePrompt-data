Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided is complex and attempts to solve the problem using a combination of precomputed arrays `A` and `B` to handle the movements of the pinball efficiently. However, upon closer inspection, there seems to be an issue with the logic used to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid in certain cases.

One specific case where the program fails is when the grid is entirely composed of '<' characters. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4
<<<<
```

The expected output for this input is:

```
1 2 3 4
```

However, the program's output for this case is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the pinball starts from the leftmost cell and moves continuously to the left until it leaves the grid. The logic for computing the time taken in such scenarios appears to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.

This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
