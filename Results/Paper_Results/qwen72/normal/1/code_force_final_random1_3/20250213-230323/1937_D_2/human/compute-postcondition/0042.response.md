Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged based on the conditions described.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is 1, the new value of `i` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
