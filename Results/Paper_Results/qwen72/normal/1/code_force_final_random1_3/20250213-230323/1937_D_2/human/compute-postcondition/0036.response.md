Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `len(idx_B)` is greater than 0, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns a value to `x` based on the last element in `B`, the last element in `idx_B`, and the current value of `i`.
- Since `B` is an empty list, `len(B)` is 0, which means `B[len(B) - 1]` would raise an index error. However, the precondition states that `len(idx_B)` is greater than 0, which implies that `B` must also contain at least one element to match the structure of the problem.
- Therefore, `B[len(B) - 1]` refers to the last element in `B`, and `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` refers to the last element in `idx_B`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
