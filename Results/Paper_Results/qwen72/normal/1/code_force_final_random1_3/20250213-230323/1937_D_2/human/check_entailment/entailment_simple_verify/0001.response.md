### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The character in the cell is flipped after the pinball moves.
   - The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed for positions where the character is `>`.
   - `B` is computed for positions where the character is `<`.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - For `A`:
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the character is `>`, compute the steps required to reach the next `>` or the boundary.
   - For `B`:
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the character is `<`, compute the steps required to reach the next `<` or the boundary.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each starting position, use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total steps.
   - The logic involves checking the current character and using the appropriate precomputed values to calculate the total steps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or after a few steps.
   - The precomputation ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The precomputation steps are linear in terms of the length of the string `s`.
   - The query handling is also linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n)\) for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization and Input Reading**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
  - It calls the function `func_1` to process the string `s`.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **First Loop (Precompute `A`)**:
    - Iterates from left to right.
    - If the character is `>`, it computes the steps required to reach the next `>` or the boundary.
    - This is stored in the list `A` and the indices of `>` are stored in `idx_A`.
  - **Second Loop (Precompute `B`)**:
    - Iterates from right to left.
    - If the character is `<`, it computes the steps required to reach the next `<` or the boundary.
    - This is stored in the list `B` and the indices of `<` are stored in `idx_B`.
  - **Third Loop (Query Handling)**:
    - Iterates through each position in the string.
    - Depending on the character at the current position (`>` or `<`), it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total steps.
    - The logic for calculating the total steps is complex but follows the precomputed values and the positions of the characters.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the algorithm: precomputation and query handling.
- The precomputation steps are correctly described and implemented.
- The query handling logic is complex but follows the precomputed values and the positions of the characters.
- The program handles edge cases and large inputs efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. The precomputation and query handling are well-structured and should handle the given constraints efficiently.
