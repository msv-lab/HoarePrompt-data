To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
   - `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `i` is `1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The variable `a` is assigned a new value based on the expression `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `r` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a valid index within the bounds of `B` and `idx_B`.
   - `B[r - 1]` is the value at index `r - 1` in the list `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the value at index `r - 1` in the list `idx_B`.
   - `i` is `1` as per the initial state.
   - The expression `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` calculates the difference between the index of the '<' character and `i`, multiplied by `r`.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Let's denote `B[r - 1]` as `B_val`.
   - Let's denote `idx_B[r - 1]` as `idx_val`.
   - The value of `a` is calculated as:
     \[
     a = B_{\text{val}} + (idx_{\text{val}} - 1) \times r
     \]

5. **Output State:**
   - The value of `a` is updated to the calculated value.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `1`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`.**
