The code snippet `x = r - (l + 2)` calculates the value of `x` based on the current values of `r` and `l`. Given the initial state:

- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- `a` is `A[0]`.
- The character at position `i` in `s` is '>'.
- `l` is less than `r`.

The calculation for `x` is:
\[ x = r - (l + 2) \]

Given:
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- `l` is `0`.

So:
\[ x = r - (0 + 2) = r - 2 \]

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`, `a` is `A[0]`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, and `x` is `r - 2`.**
