Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `r` is one less than its original value.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values involved:

- `i` is explicitly given as `2`.
- The expression `i + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `3` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **3 **
