Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables involved:
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `1`.
- The expression `i + 1` will therefore evaluate to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2 **
