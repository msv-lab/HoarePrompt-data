To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is updated to a calculated value.
- `b` is initially set to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- If `l - r > 0`, `b` is further updated to:
  - `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`
  - Plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Expression in the Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `a`**:
   - `a` is a calculated value, but the exact value is not specified in the initial state. We will denote it as `a`.

2. **Value of `b`**:
   - Initially, `b` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - If `l - r > 0`, `b` is further updated to:
     - `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`
     - Plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

3. **Expression Calculation**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `a * 2`: This is simply `2 * a`.
     - `b * 2`: This is `2 * b`, where `b` is the value after the potential update.
     - `(n - i)`: This is the difference between `n` and `i`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * a + 2 * b + (n - i) (where `a` is the calculated value of `a`, `b` is the value after the potential update, `n` is the value of `n`, and `i` is the value of `i`)**
