Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `bOnes = 0` resets the value of `bOnes` to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `aOnes`) retain their previous values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
