#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:

                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
                bOnes += 1

                break

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be equal to the initial value of `t` (the number of test cases) because the loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new values read from the input, `a` and `b` are updated with new lists of integers read from the input, `newk` is set to `k // 2`, and `i` is incremented until it exceeds `k`. The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and are updated based on the conditions within the loop. After the loop completes for all `t` iterations, the final state will reflect the results of the last iteration, with `aOnes` and `bOnes` indicating whether the conditions for 'yes' or 'no' were met for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function then checks if it is possible to select `k/2` unique elements from both `a` and `b` such that each selected element appears in both lists. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state reflects the results of the last test case.
