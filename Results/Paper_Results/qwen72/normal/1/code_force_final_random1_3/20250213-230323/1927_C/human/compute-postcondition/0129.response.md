Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Furthermore, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. The current value of `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
