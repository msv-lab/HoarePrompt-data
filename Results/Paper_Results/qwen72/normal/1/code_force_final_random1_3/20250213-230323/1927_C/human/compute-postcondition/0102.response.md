Postcondition: ***`t` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to 4. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
