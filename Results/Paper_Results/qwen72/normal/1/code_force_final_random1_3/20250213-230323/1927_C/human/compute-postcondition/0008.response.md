To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i <= k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is an integer read from the input.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Given that `i` is 1, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once because `i` is already 1, and the condition `i <= k` will be true as long as `k` is at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
