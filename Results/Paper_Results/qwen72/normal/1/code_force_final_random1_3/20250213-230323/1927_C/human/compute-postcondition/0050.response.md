Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and meet the condition `aOnes < bOnes` up to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and meet the condition `bOnes < aOnes` up to `newk`. Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.**
