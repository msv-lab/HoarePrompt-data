The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `aOnes` is incremented by 1, `bOnes` is set based on the conditions described.**
