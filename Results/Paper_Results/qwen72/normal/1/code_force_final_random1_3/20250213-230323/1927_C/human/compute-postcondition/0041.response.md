Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.***
