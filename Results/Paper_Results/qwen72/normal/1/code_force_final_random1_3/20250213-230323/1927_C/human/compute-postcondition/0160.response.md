Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the final counts of how many times the conditions for incrementing them were met during the loop execution. Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.**
