Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is incremented by 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- `newk` is set to `k // 2`.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted according to the loop's rules.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted according to the loop's rules.
- Either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('no')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.
- The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`).
- The statement will always print `'no'` regardless of the values of these variables.

### Output:
**no**
