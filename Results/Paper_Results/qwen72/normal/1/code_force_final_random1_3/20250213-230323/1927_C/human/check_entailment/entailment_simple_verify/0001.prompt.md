You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be equal to the initial value of `t` (the number of test cases) because the loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new values read from the input, `a` and `b` are updated with new lists of integers read from the input, `newk` is set to `k // 2`, and `i` is incremented until it exceeds `k`. The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and are updated based on the conditions within the loop. After the loop completes for all `t` iterations, the final state will reflect the results of the last iteration, with `aOnes` and `bOnes` indicating whether the conditions for 'yes' or 'no' were met for the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization of Counters:**
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These variables are used to count how many elements from 1 to `k` have been found in arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which is the number of elements that need to be chosen from each array.

3. **Loop to Check Elements:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i` in this range:
     - If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, it increments the counter (`aOnes` or `bOnes`) that has fewer elements.
     - If `i` is present only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
     - If `i` is present only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
     - If `i` is not found in either array or the respective counter has already reached `newk`, the loop breaks.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints "yes"; otherwise, it prints "no".

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly ensures that the program checks if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included.
- The use of counters `aOnes` and `bOnes` is appropriate to keep track of the number of elements chosen from each array.
- The loop correctly handles the condition where an element must be chosen from one array if it is present in both arrays, ensuring that the distribution is balanced.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
