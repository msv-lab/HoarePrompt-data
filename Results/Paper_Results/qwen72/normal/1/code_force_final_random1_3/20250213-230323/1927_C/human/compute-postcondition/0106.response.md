Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t + 1`: This indicates that `t` is incremented by 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- `newk` is `k // 2`: This means `newk` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
- `i` is `k + 1`: This means `i` is `k` plus 1.
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted according to the loop's rules.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted according to the loop's rules.
- `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and their values, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly because the `print` statement is printing a constant string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **yes**
