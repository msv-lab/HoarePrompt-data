Postcondition: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted according to the loop's rules, and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted according to the loop's rules. Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.**
