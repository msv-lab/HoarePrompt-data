To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i <= k:
```

The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `i` is 1
- `k` is an integer read from the input

For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, `k` must be ensured to be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**
