Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input.
- `newk` is defined as `k // 2`.
- `i` is defined as `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and meet the condition `aOnes < bOnes` up to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and meet the condition `bOnes < aOnes` up to `newk`.
- Additionally, it is stated that `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

Given these conditions, the `print('yes')` statement will always print the string `'yes'` because the conditions specified do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The conditions only describe the state of the variables but do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **yes**
