Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user where `n` is the first element, `f` is the second element, `a` is the third element, and `b` is the last element. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If the difference between the fourth element of `arr` and the third element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` and now also contains the value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.***
