Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i-1]` is less than `b / a`.
- If the condition is true, the difference multiplied by `a` (i.e., `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`) is appended to `array2`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and `array2` will contain all the valid differences that met the condition during the loop's execution.
- The other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `test_cases`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
