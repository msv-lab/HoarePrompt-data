Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is less than `b / a`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.***
