Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

Explanation:
- The value of `f` is updated to `feat[1]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `array2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
