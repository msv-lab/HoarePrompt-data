Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i`**: `i` is set to `n-1`.
2. **`n`**: `n` is the first element of the list `feat`.
3. **`f`**: `f` is the second element of the list `feat`.
4. **`a`**: `a` is the third element of the list `feat`.
5. **`b`**: `b` is the last element of the list `feat`.
6. **`test_cases`**: `test_cases` is greater than 0.
7. **`arr`**: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
8. **`array2`**: `array2` is a list containing elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.
9. **Sum Condition**: The sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a detailed setup of variables and conditions, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` regardless of the initial state.

Output: **No**
