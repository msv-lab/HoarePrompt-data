Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list, and `n` must be less than `test_cases`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` in the `arr` list is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`.**
