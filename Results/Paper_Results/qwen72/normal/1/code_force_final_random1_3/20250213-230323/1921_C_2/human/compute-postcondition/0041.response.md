The code appends a new element to `array2` which is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a` is `feat[2]`, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, the new element appended to `array2` is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` now contains the element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]` in addition to its previous elements.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * feat[2]` in addition to its previous elements.**
