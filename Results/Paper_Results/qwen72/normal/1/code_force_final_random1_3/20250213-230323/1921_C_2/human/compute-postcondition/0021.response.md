To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `test_cases` is greater than 0.
   - `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
     - `n` is the first element of `feat`.
     - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
     - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
     - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is used to filter the differences between consecutive elements in `arr`.
   - For each valid difference, the value `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` is added to `array2`.
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` is then calculated.
   - The product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is also calculated.
   - The sum of these two values must be less than `f` for the condition to be true.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement will execute if the condition described above is met.
   - Since the initial state and the condition are explicitly stated and the condition is satisfied, the `print('Yes')` statement will indeed print "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
