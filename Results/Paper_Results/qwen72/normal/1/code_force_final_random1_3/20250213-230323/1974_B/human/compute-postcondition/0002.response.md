To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `char` and the string `s`.

Given:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.

For the loop to execute, the string `s` must have at least one character. The variable `char` will take the value of each character in `s` during each iteration of the loop.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the only requirement is that `s` must not be empty. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `unique_chars`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `s` has at least one character.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1, `char` is the first character in `s`**.
