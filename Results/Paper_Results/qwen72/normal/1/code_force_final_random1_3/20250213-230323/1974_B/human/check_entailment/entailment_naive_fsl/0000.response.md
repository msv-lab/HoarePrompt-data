Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the decoding process correctly. Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1` function is flawed. The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the `unique_chars` list, but it does not correctly map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
The actual output will be incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly reverse the encoding process. The logic for replacing characters is flawed, and it does not maintain the correct mapping between the encoded and original characters.

To fix this, the function should create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters and then apply this mapping to decode the string. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected function creates a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart and then uses this mapping to decode the string. This ensures that the decoding process is correct for all potential cases.
