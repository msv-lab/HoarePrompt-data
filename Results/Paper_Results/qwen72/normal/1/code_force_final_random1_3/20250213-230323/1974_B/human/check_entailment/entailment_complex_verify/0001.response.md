Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**: The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of unique characters from `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**: To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. We should:
   - Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
   - Sort these unique characters to form the string `r`.
   - Replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the decoding.
   - It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `s` and sorts them.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - The loop iterates over each character in `s` and attempts to replace it with the corresponding character from `unique_chars`.
     - The use of `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` is incorrect because it replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`, which is not what we want. We need to replace each character individually.
     - The `else` block where `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` is used is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotation correctly states that after the loop, `s` will consist of the last unique character in `unique_chars` repeated for each character in the original `s` that was in `unique_chars`. This is indeed incorrect behavior.
   - The `unique_chars` list will contain all characters from the original `s` in the order they first appeared, which is not the desired output for decoding.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should create a mapping from each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Use this mapping to construct the decoded string.

6. **Proposed Fix**:
   - Create a dictionary to map each character in `s` to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Use this dictionary to construct the decoded string.

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the loop and the incorrect use of `s.replace`.

Final: **False**
