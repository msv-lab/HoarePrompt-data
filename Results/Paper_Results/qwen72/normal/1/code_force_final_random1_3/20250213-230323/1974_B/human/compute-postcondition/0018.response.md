The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is at least 1. The variable `char` is the current character being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` has at least one character left, the next character will be the new `char`, and the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. `char` is the next character in the string `s`.**
