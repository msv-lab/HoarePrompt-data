Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. If `char` (the first character in the original `s`) is in the set of unique characters (`unique_chars`), all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is added to `unique_chars` at index `i + 1`, and `j` is increased by 1.***
