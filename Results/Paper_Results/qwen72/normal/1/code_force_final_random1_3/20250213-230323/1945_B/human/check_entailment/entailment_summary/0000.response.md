Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, there are a few issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visibility Window**: The program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`. This is intended to represent the earliest time when the visibility window of the first firework overlaps with the next firework. However, this calculation does not correctly account for the overlapping periods of multiple fireworks.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Divisibility**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not appropriate for determining the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. The divisibility check should not be the primary factor in determining the number of simultaneous fireworks.

3. **Incorrect Formula for Simultaneous Fireworks**: The formula `print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)` is incorrect. It does not correctly account for the overlapping periods of fireworks launched at different frequencies.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of `a` and `b` to find the period at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
- **Determine the number of fireworks visible within the visibility window** by considering the LCM and the visibility duration `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

Explanation:
- **LCM Calculation**: We use the `lcm` function to find the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.
- **Visibility Calculation**: We calculate the number of fireworks visible within the visibility window `(m + 1)` for each installation and subtract the overcounted simultaneous launches using the LCM.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
