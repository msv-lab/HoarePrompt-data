Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t`, `a` is the last integer input by the user, `b` is the second last integer input by the user, `m` is the third last integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the program maintains these values. Otherwise, the program also maintains these values.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop, and `mn` will be the result of `min(a, b) + m` from that last iteration. The conditions checked within the loop (whether `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1) will still hold true or false based on the last set of inputs.
