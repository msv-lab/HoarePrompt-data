Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mn = min(a, b) + m` updates the value of `mn` to be the sum of the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The new value of `mn` is explicitly stated as `min(a, b) + m`.
