The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the description, it appears to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function likely accepts these parameters either through arguments or input within the function body. For each test case, the function calculates some result based on the given frequencies of launching (`a` and `b`) and the visibility duration (`m`) of a firework.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function's primary task is to determine a specific outcome (which is not explicitly stated but could be related to the timing or overlap of firework launches) for each test case and return these results.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given frequencies of launching (`a` and `b`) and the visibility duration (`m`) of a firework.**
