Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if either `a` or `b` is 1, the number of fireworks visible at any time can be significantly higher because the installations will launch fireworks every minute. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The expected output is 4, but the program outputs 3. This is because the program calculates `mn` as `min(1, 1) + 1 = 2`, and then computes `mn // a + mn // b` which is `2 // 1 + 2 // 1 = 2 + 2 = 4`. However, the program incorrectly adds 1 to the result only if `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` and both `a` and `b` are not 1, which is not the correct condition for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
