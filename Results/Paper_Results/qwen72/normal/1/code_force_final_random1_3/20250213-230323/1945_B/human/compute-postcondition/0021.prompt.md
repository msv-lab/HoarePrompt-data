Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    mn = min(a, b) + m
    if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:
        print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
    else:
        print(mn // a + mn // b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `m` is an integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `m % a` is not 0, or `m % b` is not 0, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` equals 1, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, maintaining the same values for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the program maintains these values. Otherwise, the program also maintains these values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
