The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This operation updates the values of these variables, replacing their initial states with the new values provided by the user.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `i` is 1,
- `a` is an integer input by the user,
- `b` is an integer input by the user,
- `m` is an integer input by the user,
- `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the user through the `input()` function.
- The value of `mn` remains unchanged because it is calculated based on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m` based on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
