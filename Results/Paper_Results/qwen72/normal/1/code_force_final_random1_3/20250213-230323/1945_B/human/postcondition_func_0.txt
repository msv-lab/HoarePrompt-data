The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, representing the frequency of launching for two installations and the visibility duration of a firework, respectively. It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b`, adds `m` to it, and then prints a result based on whether `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` (and neither `a` nor `b` is 1). The function outputs a series of results, one for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the processed values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` for the last test case.
