To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer input by the user.
   - `b` is an integer input by the user.
   - `m` is an integer input by the user.
   - `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.
   - `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`.
   - Neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1.

2. **Calculation:**
   - `mn = min(a, b) + m`
   - The expression to be printed is `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the minimum of `a` and `b` as `min_val`. So, `min_val = min(a, b)`.
   - Therefore, `mn = min_val + m`.
   - We need to compute `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, `m` can be written as \( m = k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \) where \( k \) is an integer and \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.
   - Given that `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, `m // a` and `m // b` are both integers.
   - Let's denote \( m // a = q_a \) and \( m // b = q_b \).

5. **Substituting into the Expression:**
   - `mn = min_val + m`
   - `mn // a = (min_val + m) // a = (min_val + k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)) // a`
   - `mn // b = (min_val + m) // b = (min_val + k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)) // b`

6. **Final Expression:**
   - `mn // a + mn // b + 1 = (min_val + k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)) // a + (min_val + k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)) // b + 1`
   - Since `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the terms `k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) // a` and `k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) // b` simplify to `k \cdot (b / \gcd(a, b))` and `k \cdot (a / \gcd(a, b))` respectively, where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The exact numerical value of the expression depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, but the structure of the problem ensures that the result is an integer.
   - The final output will be the sum of the integer divisions plus 1.

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1 (where a, b, and m are the input values, and m is divisible by both a and b)**
