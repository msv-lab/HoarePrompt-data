Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `m` is an integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `m % a` is not 0, or `m % b` is not 0, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.***
