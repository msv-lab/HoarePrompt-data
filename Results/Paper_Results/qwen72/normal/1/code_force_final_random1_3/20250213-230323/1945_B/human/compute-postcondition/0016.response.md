The provided code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This operation overrides the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` with new values provided by the user. The value of `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m` using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.**
