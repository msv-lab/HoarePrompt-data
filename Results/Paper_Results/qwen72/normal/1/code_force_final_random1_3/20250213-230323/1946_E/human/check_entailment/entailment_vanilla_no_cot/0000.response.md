Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic and possibly dynamic programming or other advanced algorithms. The functions provided seem to be related to modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which might be used in some parts of the solution but do not constitute a complete solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.
