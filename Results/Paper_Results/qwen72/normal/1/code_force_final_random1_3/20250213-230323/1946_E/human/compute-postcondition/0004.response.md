To address the task, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a)` and its impact on the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can describe the output state based on the assumption that `func_1` returns two values.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.

The code snippet:
```
c, d = func_1(b, a)
```

Impact:
- The function `func_1` is called with arguments `b` and `a`.
- The function returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot specify the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can state that `c` and `d` now hold the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
