The code assigns the results of the function `func_1(b, a % b)` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `a % b` is not equal to 0, which means `a % b` is a positive integer less than `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0`, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a % b` is not equal to 0, `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
