Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums, but the provided functions seem to be related to modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are not directly relevant to solving the permutation counting problem.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3
  1 2
  2 3 4
  ```
  The expected output is `3`, as there are three valid permutations: `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.

However, the provided functions do not perform any operations related to generating or counting permutations, so they will not produce the correct output for this or any other similar input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
