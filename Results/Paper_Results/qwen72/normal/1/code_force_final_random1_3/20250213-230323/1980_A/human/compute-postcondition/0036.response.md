The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `prob` was the current element in `a`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `prob` needs to be the next element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros except the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` which is now 2, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the next element in `a` after the current one, if any**
