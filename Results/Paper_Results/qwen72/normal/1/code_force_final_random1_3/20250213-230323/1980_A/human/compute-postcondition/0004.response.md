Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `freq` as a list containing 7 zeros. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
