To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, indicating that its value is not important. However, the loop will iterate based on the value of `t`.
- The variable `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, m)` with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and `m` being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already given as a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The throwaway variable `_` does not require any specific state adjustment.

Therefore, the state remains the same, but we can explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, m)` with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and `m` being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list.**
