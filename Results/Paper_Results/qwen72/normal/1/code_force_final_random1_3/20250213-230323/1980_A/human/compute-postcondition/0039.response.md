Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character 'A' + i in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 0 < t <= 1000.
- **`test_cases`**: Remains a list of tuples.
- **`results`**: Contains the values of `missing` after each iteration of the loop, with one more value added for each test case.
- **`n`**: Remains the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`.
- **`m`**: Remains the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`.
- **`a`**: Remains a non-empty list of characters.
- **`freq`**: After the loop completes, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character 'A' + i in the list `a`.
- **`missing`**: After the loop completes, `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`. This means `missing` will reflect the total number of characters in `a` that need to be added to meet the requirement of having at least `m` occurrences of each character.
