Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by counting the frequency of each difficulty level in the given problem bank and then calculates the number of additional problems required to meet the requirement for holding `m` rounds. The calculation of the missing problems is done by determining how many more problems of each difficulty are needed to reach the count of `m` for each difficulty level, and this is summed up to get the total number of new problems required. The program's structure and logic align with the problem statement and the expected output.
