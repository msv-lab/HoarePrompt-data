Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format by defining `t` and `test_cases`. It iterates over the test cases using a loop, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (to account for difficulties 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array based on the character's position in the alphabet. This is done using `ord(prob) - ord('A')`, which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by computing `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in the `freq` array. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, no additional problems are needed. The `sum` function then adds up these values to get the total number of missing problems.

4. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result at the end. This matches the expected output format.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
