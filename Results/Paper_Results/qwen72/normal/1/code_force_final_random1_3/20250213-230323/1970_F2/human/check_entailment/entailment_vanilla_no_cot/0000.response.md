Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**: The `func_1` function is used to move entities, but it incorrectly swaps the x and y coordinates when moving. The movement should be applied to the y-coordinate first (for up and down movements) and then to the x-coordinate (for left and right movements).

2. **Incorrect Ball Catching Logic**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who catches the Quaffle.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**: The logic for checking if a player scores a goal is flawed. The program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals, but it should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and then if the position matches a goal of the opposing team.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Quaffle Reset**: When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should always reset to the middle of the field, regardless of which team scored. The current implementation only resets the Quaffle to the middle if the player who scored is not in their own goal.

5. **Handling of Multiple Eliminations**: The program correctly handles multiple eliminations but does not ensure that the Quaffle is dropped correctly if the player carrying it is eliminated.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant parts of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R'] and quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B'] and quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly according to the problem description.
