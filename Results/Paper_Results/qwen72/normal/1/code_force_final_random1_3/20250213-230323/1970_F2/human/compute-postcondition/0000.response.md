The code attempts to unpack the value of `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. However, since `a` is described as an integer, it cannot be unpacked in this way, which would result in a `TypeError`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers. An error occurs because `a` cannot be unpacked into `x` and `y`.**
