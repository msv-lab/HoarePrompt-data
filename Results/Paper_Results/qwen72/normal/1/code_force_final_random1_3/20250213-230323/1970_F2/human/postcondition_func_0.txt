The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be tuples or lists containing two elements. However, due to an error in the code, it attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which fails if `b` is not a tuple or list with exactly two elements. As a result, the function does not return any values and results in an error.
