To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is the same as the initial input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `k` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is 0.
- `res` is the input string from the last iteration.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `range(1, n)` must produce at least one value for `i`.
- This means `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate values from 1 to `n-1`).

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop, as the loop will iterate over values starting from 1.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `best` is 0, and `res` is the input string from the last iteration.**
