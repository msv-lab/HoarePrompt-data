Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is 1 if `res` is not `<`, otherwise `k` is 2.
   - `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0.
   - `res` is an input string, and if `res` is `<`, the current value of `res` is `<`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1.

4. **Determine the Values of Other Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - The first argument in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
   - The second argument is 0.
   - The third argument is `k`, which we determined above.
   - The fourth argument is 0.
   - The fifth argument is `i`, which is 3.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the values 0, `k`, 0, and 3, separated by spaces.
   - The value of `k` will be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be one of the following:

- If `res` is `<`:
  Output: **? 0 2 0 3**

- If `res` is not `<`:
  Output: **? 0 1 0 3**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, based on the precondition, the most precise description is:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 3 (where [k] is 1 if res is not '<', otherwise [k] is 2)**
