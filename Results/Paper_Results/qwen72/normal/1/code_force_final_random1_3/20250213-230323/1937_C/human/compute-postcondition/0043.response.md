Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- The first argument is the string `'?'`.
- The second argument is the integer `0`.
- The third argument is the value of `k`, which is `1`.
- The fourth argument is the integer `0`.
- The fifth argument is the value of `i`, which is `2`.

The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
