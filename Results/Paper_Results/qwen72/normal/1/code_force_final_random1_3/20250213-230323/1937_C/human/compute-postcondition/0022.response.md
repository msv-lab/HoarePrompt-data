Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 1.
- `best`: The value of `best` is 0.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 1 again.
- `i`: The value of `i` is 1.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
