The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates in an environment where it can interactively query a judge to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function's goal is to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using no more than 3n queries. The input n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
