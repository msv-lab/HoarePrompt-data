Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`.
- `best` is 0.
- `res` is the input string.
- If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 1 and `res` remains the input string.
- Otherwise, `best` remains 0 and `res` remains the input string.

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is initially set to 1 and will remain 1 unless there is a specific condition that changes it, but no such condition is mentioned in the initial state.
- The variable `best` is initially set to 0 and will only change to 1 if `res` is `<`.
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The variable `res` is the input string, but its exact value is not provided, so we don't need to worry about its content for this print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 0 (since no condition is mentioned that changes it).
- `i` is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 0 1 2**
