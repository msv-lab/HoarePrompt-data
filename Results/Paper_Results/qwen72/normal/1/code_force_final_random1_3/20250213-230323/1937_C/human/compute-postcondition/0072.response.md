Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`.
- `res` is the input string.
- If `res` is `<`, `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**: According to the initial state, `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`. Since there is no information indicating that `res` was `<` for any `i`, `k` remains 1.
2. **`best`**: The value of `best` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `<`, `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` remains 0. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `res`, we cannot determine if `res` is `<` or not. Therefore, we assume the default value of `best` which is 0.
3. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 1.
- `best`: The value of `best` is 0.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 1.
- `i`: The value of `i` is 3.

Thus, the final output will be:
Output: **? 1 0 1 3**
