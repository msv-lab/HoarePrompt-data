The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value represents the number of iterations or test cases the loop will run.

State: **The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a judge to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using no more than 3n queries. The input n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The number of test cases (int(input())) must be greater than 0.**
