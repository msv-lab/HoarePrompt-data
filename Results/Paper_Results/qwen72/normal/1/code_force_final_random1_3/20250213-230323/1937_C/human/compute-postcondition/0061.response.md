Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1 (as determined by the loop).
- `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`.
- `best` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values of the variables and objects that are printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `k`: According to the initial state, `k` remains 1.
- `best`: According to the initial state, `best` is 0.
- `k`: Again, this is 1.
- `i`: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
