Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1 if `res` is `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is 2, `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `best`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects the new value of `best` while keeping the initial conditions for the other variables intact.
