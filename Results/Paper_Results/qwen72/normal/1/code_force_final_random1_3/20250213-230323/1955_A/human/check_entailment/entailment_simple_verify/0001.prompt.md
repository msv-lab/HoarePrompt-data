You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are the inputs provided for the last iteration. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the output is `A * B`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`. The total number of iterations is equal to the value of `int(input())`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider both the regular price and the promotional price to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the minimum cost:
     - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it prints the total cost as `A * B`.
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it prints the total cost as `A * C / 2`.
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it calculates the cost for the even part (`X * C`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
     - This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotional price.
     - If true, the total cost is simply `A * B` because it's always cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts is even.
     - If true, the total cost is `A * C / 2` because we can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - **Condition 3:** `else`
     - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.
     - It calculates the cost for the even part (`X * C`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `A` is even, the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `A` is odd, the cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `A` is even, the cost is `4 * 11 / 2 = 22 / 2 = 20`.
