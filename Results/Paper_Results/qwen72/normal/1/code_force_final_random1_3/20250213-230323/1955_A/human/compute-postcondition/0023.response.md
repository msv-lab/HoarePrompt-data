Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`:
     - If `A` is even, no further changes are made.
     - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(int(A * C / 2))` is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2. This ensures that the input is valid and meets the precondition.

2. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate `B * 2 < C`:
     - If true, no further changes are made.
     - If false, proceed to the next condition.
   - Evaluate `B * 2 >= C`:
     - If true, check if `A` is even:
       - If `A` is even, no further changes are made.
       - If `A` is odd, set `X` to `A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - Regardless of the conditions, the print statement `print(int(A * C / 2))` will always execute.
   - The expression `int(A * C / 2)` calculates the integer division of `A * C` by 2.

### Final Output:

- The value of `A` and `C` are not explicitly changed by the conditions, so they retain their original values from the input.
- The print statement will output the result of `int(A * C / 2)`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the integers from the input)**
