Output State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no further changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
- The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` to the integers provided by the user.
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks if `B * 2` is less than `C`. If true, no further changes are made.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, the next condition `if A % 2 == 0` checks if `A` is even. If true, no further changes are made.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
- The value of `int(input())` being greater than 1 is a precondition that remains valid.
