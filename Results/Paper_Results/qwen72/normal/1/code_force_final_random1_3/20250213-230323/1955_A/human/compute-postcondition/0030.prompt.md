You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are the inputs provided for the last iteration. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the output is `A * B`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`. The total number of iterations is equal to the value of `int(input())`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges. It returns a result for each test case, likely a list of results corresponding to each set of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
