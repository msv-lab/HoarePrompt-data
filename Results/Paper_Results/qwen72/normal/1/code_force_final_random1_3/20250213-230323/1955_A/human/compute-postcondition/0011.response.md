Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no further changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2` (which is an integer).***
