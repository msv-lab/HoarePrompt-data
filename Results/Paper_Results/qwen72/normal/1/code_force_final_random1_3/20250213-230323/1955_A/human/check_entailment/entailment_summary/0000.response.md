Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the prices for one yogurt (`a`) and for two yogurts (`b`). The logic in the program is designed to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `a` and `b`.

1. **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**  
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.

2. **Case 2: `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even**  
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually is greater than or equal to the promotional price, and the number of yogurts `A` is even, then it is optimal to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotional price. The total cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.

3. **Case 3: `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd**  
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually is greater than or equal to the promotional price, and the number of yogurts `A` is odd, then it is optimal to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotional price and buy the remaining one yogurt individually. The total cost is `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output for the given examples. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
