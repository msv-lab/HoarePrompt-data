### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider both the regular price and the promotional price to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the minimum cost:
     - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it prints the total cost as `A * B`.
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it prints the total cost as `A * C / 2`.
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it calculates the cost for the even part (`X * C`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
     - This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotional price.
     - If true, the total cost is simply `A * B` because it's always cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts is even.
     - If true, the total cost is `A * C / 2` because we can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - **Condition 3:** `else`
     - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.
     - It calculates the cost for the even part (`X * C`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `A` is even, the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `A` is odd, the cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `A` is even, the cost is `4 * 11 / 2 = 22 / 2 = 20`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
