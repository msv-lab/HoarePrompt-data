### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider both the regular price and the promotional price to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the minimum cost:
     - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it prints the total cost as `A * B`.
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it prints the total cost as `A * C / 2`.
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it calculates the cost for the even part (`X * C`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
     - This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotional price.
     - If true, the total cost is simply `A * B` because it's always cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts is even.
     - If true, the total cost is `A * C / 2` because we can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - **Condition 3:** `else`
     - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.
     - It calculates the cost for the even part (`X * C`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `A` is even, the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `A` is odd, the cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `A` is even, the cost is `4 * 11 / 2 = 22 / 2 = 22`.

5. **Identifying the Error:**
   - In the fourth test case, the program outputs `20` instead of `22`.
   - The issue lies in the calculation of the cost when `A` is even. The program uses `int(A * C / 2)`, which truncates the result to an integer. However, the division should be performed as a floating-point operation to ensure accuracy before converting to an integer.

6. **Corrected Calculation:**
   - The correct calculation for the even case should be `int(A * C / 2.0)` to ensure the division is performed as a floating-point operation.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the division operation in the even case. The original assessment was mostly accurate but missed this subtle error. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the truncation issue in the even case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
