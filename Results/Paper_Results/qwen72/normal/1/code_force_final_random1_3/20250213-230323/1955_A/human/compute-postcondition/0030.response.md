Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. Depending on the values of these integers, it prints one of the following results:
- If `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

The function processes a total number of test cases equal to the integer value read from the first line of input. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further state changes occur. **
