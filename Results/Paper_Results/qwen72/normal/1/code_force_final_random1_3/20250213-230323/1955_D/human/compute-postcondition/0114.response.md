Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` remains 0 if `a[2]` is not in `b_values` or if `cnt_b[a[2]]` is less than 0 after decrementing, otherwise `curr` is set to 1.**
