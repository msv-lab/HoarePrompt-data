The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`.
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is the count of `a[0]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`.
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.

Since `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` must initially be at least 1 (because `a[i]` is one of the elements in `b`).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is now `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`.**
