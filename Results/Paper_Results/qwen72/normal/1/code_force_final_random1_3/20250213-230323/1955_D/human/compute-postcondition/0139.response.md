Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is 1, the specific element `a[1]` is used to increment its count in the dictionary `cnt_b`.
