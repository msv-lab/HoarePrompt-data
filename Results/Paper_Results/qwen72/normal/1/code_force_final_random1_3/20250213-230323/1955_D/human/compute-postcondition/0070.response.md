Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `ans` is 0 if `curr` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decreased by 1.** 

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decreases the value of `cnt_b` at the index `a[2 + m]` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
