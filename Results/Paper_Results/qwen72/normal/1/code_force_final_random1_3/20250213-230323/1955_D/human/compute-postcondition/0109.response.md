Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` remains 0 if `a[1]` is not in `b_values` or if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is less than 0 after decrementing, otherwise `curr` is set to 1.**
