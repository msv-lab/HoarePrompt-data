Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n and `m` is the same as the input value for `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`.***
