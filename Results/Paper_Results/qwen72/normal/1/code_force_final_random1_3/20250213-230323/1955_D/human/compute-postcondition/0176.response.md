The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 1), and `m` must still be greater than `i` (which means `m` must be greater than 1).

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1**
