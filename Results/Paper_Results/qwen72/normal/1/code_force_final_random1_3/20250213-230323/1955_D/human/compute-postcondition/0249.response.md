To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head: `i` and `b_values`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i`: This is the current element being iterated over in `b_values`.
   - `b_values`: This is a set containing unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Current State**:
   - `m` is greater than or equal to its original value.
   - `i` is the next element in `b_values`.
   - `n` is greater than `m`.
   - `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
   - `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` met or exceeded `k`.
   - If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `b_values` to iterate over.
   - After the current iteration, the next element in `b_values` will be assigned to `i`.
   - Since `b_values` must have at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must still have at least 2 elements.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be the next element in `b_values`.
- `b_values` must still have at least 2 elements.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 2 elements, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` met or exceeded `k`, if `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
