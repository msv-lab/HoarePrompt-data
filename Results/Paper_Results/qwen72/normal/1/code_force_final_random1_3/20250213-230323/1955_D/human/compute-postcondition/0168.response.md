Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for each `i` in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 1 element, the value of `cnt_b[a[k]]` has been adjusted based on the presence of `a[k]` in `b_values` for each `k` in the range from `m` to `n-1`, the value of `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0, the value of `curr` reflects the number of elements in the current sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`, the value of `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all unique elements in the set `b_values` have had their counts in `cnt_b` reset to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged, including the initial setup of `cnt_b`, the sliding window count `curr`, and the final answer `ans`.
