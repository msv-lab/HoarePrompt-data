The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of the element in the dictionary `cnt_b` at the key `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0, the specific impact is:

- The value of `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
