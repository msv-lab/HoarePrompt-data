The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by 1. This operation does not affect any other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is two less than its original value. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is not greater than 0, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.**
