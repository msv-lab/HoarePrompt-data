Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
