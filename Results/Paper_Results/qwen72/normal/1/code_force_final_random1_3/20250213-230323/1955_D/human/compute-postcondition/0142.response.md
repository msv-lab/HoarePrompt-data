Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
