Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is a positive integer, and `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr` remain unchanged. If `curr` is less than `k`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
