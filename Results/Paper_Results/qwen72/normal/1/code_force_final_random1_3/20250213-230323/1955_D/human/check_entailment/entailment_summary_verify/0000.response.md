### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It updates `cnt_b` with the frequencies of elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements in the current window that match elements in `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - It slides the window over the array `a` from position `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element entering the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr`.
   - For each element leaving the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr`.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after updating, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting State:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to ensure it is ready for the next test case.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The function correctly initializes and updates the frequency count of elements in `b`.
  - It correctly handles the sliding window mechanism to count the number of good subarrays.
  - The conditions for checking if the current window is good (`curr >= k`) are implemented correctly.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `m`.
  - It also handles cases where there are duplicate elements in `a` and `b`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sliding window approach ensures that the function runs in linear time relative to the size of `a` for each test case, making it efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential scenarios correctly. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
