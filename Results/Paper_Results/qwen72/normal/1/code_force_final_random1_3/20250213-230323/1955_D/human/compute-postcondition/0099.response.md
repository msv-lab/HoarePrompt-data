Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, and `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. These conditions remain valid after the code execution.
