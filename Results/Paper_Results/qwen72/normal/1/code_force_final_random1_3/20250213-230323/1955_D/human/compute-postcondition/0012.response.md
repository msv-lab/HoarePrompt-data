Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is now 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` which is now 1, and `cnt_b[b[2]]` which is now 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
