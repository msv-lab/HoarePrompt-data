You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it counts the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements present in `b` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The internal state of the function, including variables like `cnt_b`, `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr`, is reset or updated appropriately for each new test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - The function iterates over the elements of `b` and increments their counts in `cnt_b`.
   - It also creates a set `b_values` to quickly check if an element from `a` is in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current window of size `m`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if they are in `b_values`. If so, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[i + m]`), it checks if it is in `b_values`. If so, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (`a[i]`), it checks if it is in `b_values`. If so, it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the initialization and input reading.
- It correctly counts the elements in `b` and uses a set for quick lookups.
- The initial window check and sliding window approach are implemented correctly to count the number of good subarrays.
- The function resets the counts for each test case, ensuring that the state is clean for the next test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
