Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is a positive integer, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.
- The conditions involving `a[i]`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b` are not affected by the code snippet, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
- The variables `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them.
