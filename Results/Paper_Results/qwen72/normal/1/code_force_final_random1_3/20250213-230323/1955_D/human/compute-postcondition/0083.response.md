Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least one element, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with `cnt_b[i]` set to 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution. Otherwise, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0, where `i` is the next element in `b_values`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
