The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the value at `b[1]` is used to determine the index in `cnt_b` to increment.

- `b[1]` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `cnt_b[b[1]]` is the current value at the index `b[1]` in `cnt_b`.
- After executing the code, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1.

All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is now 1 and `cnt_b[b[1]]` which is now 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1.**
