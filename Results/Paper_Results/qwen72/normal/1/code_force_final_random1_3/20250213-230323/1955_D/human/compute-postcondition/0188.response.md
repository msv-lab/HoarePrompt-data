Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1, the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.** 

The value of `curr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
