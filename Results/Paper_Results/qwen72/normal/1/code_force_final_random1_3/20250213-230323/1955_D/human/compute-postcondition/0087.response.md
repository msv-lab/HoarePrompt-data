The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the input provided.

Output State: **`a` remains a list of integers, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with all elements in `b_values` having their corresponding `cnt_b` values set to 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution. Otherwise, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.**
