Postcondition: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. Additionally, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
