The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the set `b_values`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i` and the set `b_values`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some element in `b_values`, and since `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 1 element, the loop can continue as long as there are more elements in `b_values` to iterate over.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `b_values` after the current `i`. Since `b_values` is a set, the order of elements is not defined, but we know that if `b_values` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `b_values`, and `b_values` still contains at least one element (since it had at least one element at the end of the previous iteration).

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 1 element, the value of `cnt_b[a[k]]` has been adjusted based on the presence of `a[k]` in `b_values` for each `k` in the range from `m` to `n-1`, the value of `cnt_b[n - m - 1]` is 0, the value of `curr` reflects the number of elements in the current sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`, the value of `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.**
