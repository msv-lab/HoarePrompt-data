Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `i` is 2, and the code increments `cnt_b[b[i]]` by 1, which means `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1. The other conditions remain unchanged.
