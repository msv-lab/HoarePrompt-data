Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1. If the resulting `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0. If `a[2]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 0.***
