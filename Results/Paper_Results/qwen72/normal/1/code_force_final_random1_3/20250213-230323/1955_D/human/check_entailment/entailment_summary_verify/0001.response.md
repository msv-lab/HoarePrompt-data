### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - The function iterates over the elements of `b` and increments their counts in `cnt_b`.
   - It also creates a set `b_values` to quickly check if an element from `a` is in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current window of size `m`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if they are in `b_values`. If so, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[i + m]`), it checks if it is in `b_values`. If so, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (`a[i]`), it checks if it is in `b_values`. If so, it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The function correctly initializes `cnt_b` and reads the input for each test case.
  - This part of the code is accurate.

- **Counting Elements in `b`:**
  - The function correctly counts the elements in `b` and uses a set `b_values` for quick lookups.
  - This part of the code is accurate.

- **Initial Window Check:**
  - The function correctly initializes `curr` and checks the first `m` elements of `a`.
  - It correctly updates `curr` and `ans` based on the conditions.
  - This part of the code is accurate.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - The function correctly implements the sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
  - It correctly updates `curr` and `ans` based on the conditions.
  - This part of the code is accurate.

- **Resetting Counts:**
  - The function correctly resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` after each test case.
  - This part of the code is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the necessary steps and edge cases correctly.

Final: **True**
