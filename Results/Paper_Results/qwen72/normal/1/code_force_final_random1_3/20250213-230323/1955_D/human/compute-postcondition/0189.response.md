Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.***
