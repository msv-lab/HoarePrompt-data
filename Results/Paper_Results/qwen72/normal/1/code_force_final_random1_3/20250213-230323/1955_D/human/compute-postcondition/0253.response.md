The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where each element in `a` and `b` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The function processes these inputs across multiple test cases, with the total sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.

The exact output of the function is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such functions would return some computed result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters.**
