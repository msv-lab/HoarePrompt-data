Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their last assigned values from the final test case, `a` and `b` retain their last assigned lists from the final test case, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the final `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with all elements in `b_values` set to 0, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found across all test cases, `curr` is the number of elements in the final sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable starts as the total number of test cases and is decremented by the number of test cases processed. After all iterations, it will be 0 if all test cases were processed.
- **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These variables retain their last assigned values from the final test case.
- **`a`, `b`**: These lists retain their last assigned values from the final test case.
- **`b_values`**: This set contains the unique elements from the final `b`.
- **`cnt_b`**: This list is reset to 0 for all elements in `b_values` after each test case, so after all iterations, it will be a list of length 1000001 with all elements in `b_values` set to 0.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the total number of valid subarrays found across all test cases.
- **`curr`**: This variable reflects the number of elements in the final sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
