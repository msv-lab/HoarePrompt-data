To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(m):
```

The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `m` must be greater than 0. The other variables mentioned in the state description do not affect the loop's ability to execute, as they are not part of the loop head.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and will take values from 0 to `m-1`.
2. **Variable `m`**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be 0 (the initial value of the loop).
- `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
