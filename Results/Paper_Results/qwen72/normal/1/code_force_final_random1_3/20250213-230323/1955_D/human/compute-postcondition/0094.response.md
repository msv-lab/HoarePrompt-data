Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[1]]` by 1 because `i` is 1. The other conditions remain unchanged: `i` is still 1, `m` is still greater than 1, and `cnt_b[b[0]]` has already been incremented by 1.
