Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, and for each element `a[k]` in the list `a` where `k` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, if `a[k]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[k]]` is decremented by 1. If the resulting `cnt_b[a[k]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. Additionally, `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
