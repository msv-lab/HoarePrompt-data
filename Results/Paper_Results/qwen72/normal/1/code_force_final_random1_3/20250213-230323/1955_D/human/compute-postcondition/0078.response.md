To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in b_values:
```

Here, the only object directly involved in the loop head is `b_values`. The loop will execute if `b_values` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `b_values` is not empty.

Let's break down the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `n - m - 1`.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `max_val` is 1000000.
- `curr` is the number of elements in `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.
- `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `b_values`. Specifically, `b_values` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - m - 1`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least one element, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution. Otherwise, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.**
