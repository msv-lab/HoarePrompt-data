### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to reflect the frequency of elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subsegment.
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`).
   - If an element is in `b_values`, it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subsegments of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[i + m]`), it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window (`a[i]`), it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check all subsegments of length `m` in `a`.
- It correctly updates the counts and the number of matching elements.
- The logic for determining if a subsegment is good is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
