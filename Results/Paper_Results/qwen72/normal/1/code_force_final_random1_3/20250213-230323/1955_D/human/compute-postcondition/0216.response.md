Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is one less than its updated value. If the new `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
