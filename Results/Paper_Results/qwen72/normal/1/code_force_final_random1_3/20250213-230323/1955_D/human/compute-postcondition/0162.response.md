To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in b_values:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the variable `i` iterates over the elements in the set `b_values`. For the loop to execute, `b_values` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned in the state (`n`, `m`, `cnt_b`, `a`, `k`, `curr`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - m - 1`
- `n` is greater than `m`
- `m` is a positive integer
- `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`
- The value of `cnt_b[a[k]]` has been adjusted based on the presence of `a[k]` in `b_values` for each `k` in the range from `m` to `n-1`
- The value of `curr` reflects the number of elements in the current sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`
- The value of `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `b_values`. Specifically, `b_values` must contain at least one element.

State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` and must have at least 1 element, the value of `cnt_b[a[k]]` has been adjusted based on the presence of `a[k]` in `b_values` for each `k` in the range from `m` to `n-1`, the value of `curr` reflects the number of elements in the current sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`, the value of `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution**
