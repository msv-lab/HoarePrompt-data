The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input).
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6.
- `max_val` is 1000000.
- `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0.
- The input must be a positive integer.

After executing the code:
- The list `a` is updated to contain the integers read from the input.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0, and the input must be a positive integer.**
