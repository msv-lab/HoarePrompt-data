Postcondition: **The loop counter `_` is equal to `int(input())`, `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' in each input string `b` where '1' was present, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, and `b` is the last user input string. If no input strings contained '1', `k` remains an empty list. Additionally, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.**
