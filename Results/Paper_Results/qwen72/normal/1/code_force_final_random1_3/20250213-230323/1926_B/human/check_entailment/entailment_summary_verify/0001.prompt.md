You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a grid of `n` x `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It then determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a 'SQUARE' or a 'TRIANGLE'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state is such that all input has been processed and the appropriate shape for each test case has been printed. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the grid retains its initial configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - It appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.

2. **Shape Determination:**
   - After collecting the counts of '1's in each row, the function checks the first two elements of the list `k`.
   - If the first two elements are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`), it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Analysis:

- **Triangle Check:**
  - A triangle is defined by having an increasing or decreasing number of '1's in each row, forming a pattern like `1, 3, 5, ...` or `5, 3, 1`.
  - The function does not explicitly check for this pattern but relies on the fact that the first two rows should have different counts of '1's if it is a triangle.

- **Square Check:**
  - A square is defined by having the same number of '1's in each row.
  - The function correctly identifies a square if the first two rows have the same count of '1's.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function assumes that the grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) and that the shape is correctly formed.
  - It does not handle cases where the grid might be empty or contain invalid shapes, but the problem statement guarantees that the grid will contain exactly one valid shape.

- **Generalization:**
  - The function only checks the first two rows to determine the shape. This works for the given constraints but might fail if the shape is more complex or if the grid size is larger.

### Conclusion:

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the function appears to correctly identify the shape based on the first two rows. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
