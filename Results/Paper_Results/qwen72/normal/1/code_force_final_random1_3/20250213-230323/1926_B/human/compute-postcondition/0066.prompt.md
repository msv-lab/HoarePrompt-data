Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by a list of n strings, each string containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's in the string representations of `b` for each iteration where '1' was found in `b`. If `k[0] == k[1]`, the first two elements of `k` are equal. Otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `int(input())`, which was the number of iterations specified at the beginning. The variable `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. The variable `i` remains 1, and `a` remains greater than 1 as they were not modified within the loop. Additionally, if the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this equality holds true. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop counter `_` is equal to `int(input())`, `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' in each input string `b` where '1' was present, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, and `b` is the last user input string. If no input strings contained '1', `k` remains an empty list. If `k` has at least two elements, the first element of `k` is either equal to or not equal to the second element of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
