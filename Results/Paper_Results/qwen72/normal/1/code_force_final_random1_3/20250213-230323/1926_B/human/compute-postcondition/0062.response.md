Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. The loop counter `_` is set to `int(input())`. This means `_` is an integer value provided by the user.
2. `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' in each input string `b` where '1' was present.
3. `i` is 2.
4. `a` is greater than 2.
5. `b` is the last user input string.
6. The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.
7. If no input strings contained '1', `k` remains an empty list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('SQUARE')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'SQUARE'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and their values, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'SQUARE'` regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **SQUARE**
