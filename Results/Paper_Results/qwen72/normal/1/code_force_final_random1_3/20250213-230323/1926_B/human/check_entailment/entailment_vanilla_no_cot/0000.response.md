Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's criteria. Here are the issues:

1. **Shape Identification**: The program only checks if the first two counts of '1's in the grid are equal to determine if the shape is a square. This is insufficient because:
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's should increase or decrease linearly by 2 for each subsequent row.

2. **Handling Triangles**: The program does not account for the specific pattern of a triangle where the number of '1's in each row forms an odd sequence (2*i - 1).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases or validate the shape properly. For example, it does not check if the '1's are aligned correctly to form a valid triangle or square.

A more robust solution would involve checking the entire grid to ensure the shape meets the criteria for either a square or a triangle. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid, n):
    count_ones = sum(row.count('1') for row in grid)
    if count_ones % n != 0:
        return False
    expected_ones_per_row = count_ones // n
    for row in grid:
        if row.count('1') != expected_ones_per_row:
            return False
    return True

def is_triangle(grid, n):
    count_ones = sum(row.count('1') for row in grid)
    k = int((1 + (1 + 8 * count_ones) ** 0.5) / 2)
    if k * (2 * k - 1) != count_ones:
        return False
    for i in range(k):
        expected_ones = 2 * i + 1
        if grid[i].count('1') != expected_ones:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_square(grid, n):
            print('SQUARE')
        elif is_triangle(grid, n):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        else:
            print('INVALID SHAPE')

func()
```

This solution includes functions `is_square` and `is_triangle` to properly check the conditions for a square and a triangle, respectively. The main function `func` reads the input and uses these helper functions to determine the shape.
