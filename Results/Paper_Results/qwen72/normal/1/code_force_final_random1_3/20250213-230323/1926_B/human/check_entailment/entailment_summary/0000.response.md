Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. It collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. Based on the counts, it determines if the shape is a square or a triangle by checking if the first two counts are equal (indicating a square) or different (indicating a triangle).

However, this approach has a critical flaw: it only checks the first two rows that contain '1's, which may not be sufficient to correctly identify the shape in all cases. For example, a triangle could have the same number of '1's in the first two rows if the triangle is large enough, leading to an incorrect classification as a square. Additionally, the program does not account for the specific structure of a triangle or a square beyond just the count of '1's in the first two rows, which is insufficient for a correct determination.

Therefore, the program is not correct because it does not accurately determine the shape based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
