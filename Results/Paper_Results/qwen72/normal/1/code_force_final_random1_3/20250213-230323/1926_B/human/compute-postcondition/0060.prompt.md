Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `int(input())`, which was the number of iterations specified at the beginning. The variable `k` is now an empty list. The variable `i` is 2, and `a` remains greater than 2. The condition about the first and second elements of `k` being equal or not equal no longer applies because `k` is now empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `k` is either an empty list or a list containing the count of '1' in `b`, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, and `b` is the user input string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is the user input string. If '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is the new user input string. If '1' is in the new `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the new `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
