The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from its current value. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 1, so `i + 2` is 3.
- `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - opNum`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. Here is the detailed output state:

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[0]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - opNum`, `stop` is True if `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum < 0`, otherwise `stop` remains False.**
