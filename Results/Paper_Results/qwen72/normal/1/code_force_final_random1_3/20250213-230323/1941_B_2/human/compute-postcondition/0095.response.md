Output State: **`numTest` is incremented by 1, `stop` is `False`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, the last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0, the second-to-last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 0, `opNum` is equal to `a[0]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is now `a[1] - 2 * opNum`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
