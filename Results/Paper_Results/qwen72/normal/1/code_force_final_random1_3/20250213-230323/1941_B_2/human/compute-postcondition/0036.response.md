Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_j` has been modified according to the loop operations, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` is now `a[n-3] - a[n-3]`, `a[n-2]` is now `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`. If `stop` is True, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop because at least one `a[i]` was less than 0 during the loop execution. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.***
