The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a placeholder used in the `range` function. The loop iterates based on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of times the loop should run. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current iteration is less than the specified number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

For the loop to execute one more time, the only thing that changes is the iteration count, which is implicitly managed by the `for` loop using the placeholder `_`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for all variables except for the implicit increment of the iteration count managed by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
