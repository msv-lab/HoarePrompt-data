Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array zero through a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the constraints and the nature of the operation.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made all zeros. This condition only checks the first and last elements, which is not enough to ensure the entire array can be zeroed out.

2. **Sum of Elements**: The correct approach involves checking if the sum of the elements in the array is even. This is because each operation decreases the sum of the array by 4 (since \( -1 - 2 - 1 = -4 \)). Therefore, if the initial sum of the array is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the array has only three elements, the operation can only be applied once, and the conditions need to be checked accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Check if the sum is divisible by 4.
3. Ensure that the array can be manipulated to zero out all elements by applying the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_sum = sum(b)
        
        if total_sum % 4 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the array `b`.
- **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum is divisible by 4. If it is, we print 'YES'; otherwise, we print 'NO'.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it uses an insufficient condition to determine if the array can be made all zeros. The correct approach involves checking the sum of the array and ensuring it is divisible by 4.
