The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is a placeholder
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.

The values of `t`, `_`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
