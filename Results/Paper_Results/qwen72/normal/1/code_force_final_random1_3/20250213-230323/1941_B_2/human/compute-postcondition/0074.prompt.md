Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is now an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` is now 0, `a[n-2]` is now `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - opNum`, `stop` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    if a[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        stop = True
        break
    opNum = a[i]
    a[i] -= opNum
    a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
    a[i + 2] -= opNum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[0]`, if `a[0]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `stop` remains False, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[0]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - opNum`, `stop` is True if `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum < 0`, otherwise `stop` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[0]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - 3 * opNum`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * opNum`, `a[4]` is `a[4] - opNum`, `n` must be greater than 4. If `a[2]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
