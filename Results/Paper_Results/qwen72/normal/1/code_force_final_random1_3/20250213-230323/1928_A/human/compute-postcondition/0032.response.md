Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` are even, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, if `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If both `a` and `b` are odd or one is even and the other is odd but `(a - b) % 2` is 0, the program behaves as specified in the else part.***
