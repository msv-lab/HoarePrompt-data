Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user. If either `a` or `b` is even, `a1` and `b1` are set to half of `a` and `b` respectively (only if they are even). If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `b` is odd, the program continues with the current iteration without modifying `b1` or `b2`. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, the program continues with the current iteration without any changes to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`.***
