Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are updated to positive integers provided by the input.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **yes**
