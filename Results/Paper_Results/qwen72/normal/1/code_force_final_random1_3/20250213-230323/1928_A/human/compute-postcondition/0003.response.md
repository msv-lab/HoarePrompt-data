Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are updated to positive integers provided by the input, and both `a` and `b` are even numbers.
- `i` is 0.
- The input value must be a positive integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'yes'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **yes**
