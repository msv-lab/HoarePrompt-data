Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the conditions under which a new rectangle can be formed.

1. **Both Dimensions Even**: If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. This is because an even-by-even rectangle can be divided into two equal parts, and these parts can be rotated to form a different rectangle. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle.

2. **One Dimension Odd and One Even**: If one dimension is odd and the other is even, Bob cannot form a new rectangle. This is because cutting an odd dimension will result in at least one part being odd, and rearranging these parts will not yield a new rectangle that is different from the original.

3. **Both Dimensions Odd**: If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle. This is because cutting an odd dimension will result in two parts, both of which will be odd, and rearranging these parts will not yield a new rectangle that is different from the original.

4. **Special Cases**: The program includes some special conditions that are not necessary for the correct solution. For example, the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are redundant and do not contribute to the correct logic. Similarly, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is overly complex and can be simplified.

Given the above reasoning, the program has some logical issues and unnecessary conditions. The correct approach should focus on the parity of the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This corrected version checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle; otherwise, he cannot.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the presence of unnecessary and incorrect conditions.

Correctness: **False**
