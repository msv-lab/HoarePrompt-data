Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the last index of `lis` (i.e., `len(lis) - 1`). No pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, and `test` is currently True. Additionally, the length of `lis` is an odd number.**
