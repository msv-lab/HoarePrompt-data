Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `test` is True.
- `j` is 1.
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1.
- Additionally, `j` is even.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It will always print the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
