Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of positive integers as input, where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. It returns 'Alice' if the first element of `arr` is not 1. If the first element is 1, the function checks if the differences between consecutive unique elements in `arr` are all 1. If any difference is greater than 1, the function returns 'Alice' if the loop breaks early, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. If all differences are exactly 1, the function returns 'Bob' unless the loop breaks early, in which case it returns 'Alice'. **
