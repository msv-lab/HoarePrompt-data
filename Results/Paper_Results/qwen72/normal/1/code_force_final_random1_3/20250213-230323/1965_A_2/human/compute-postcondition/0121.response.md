The function `func` accepts no direct parameters but operates under the context of processing multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not defined in the given information. Assuming the function returns some computed value or result for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.**
