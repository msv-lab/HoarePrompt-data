The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'` to the console. The initial state provides several conditions and variable values, but none of these affect the execution of the `print` statement, as it does not reference any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Bob**
