Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `lis` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the last index of `lis` (i.e., `len(lis) - 1`). If `test` is True, no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` is either odd or even, depending on the original length of `lis`. If `test` is False, the loop breaks and `test` remains False.***
