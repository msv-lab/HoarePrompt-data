Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the last index of `lis` (i.e., `len(lis) - 1`). If `test` is True, it indicates that no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` is either odd or even depending on the original length of `lis`. If `test` is False, it indicates that there are two consecutive elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1.***
