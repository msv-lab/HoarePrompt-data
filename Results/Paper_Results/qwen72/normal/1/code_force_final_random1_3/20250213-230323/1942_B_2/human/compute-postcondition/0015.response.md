Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i + 1]` is `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is unchanged for `_`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `i`.
- The value of `res[i + 1]` remains `t - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
- The new value of `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- All other variables and their values remain the same.
