To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `ar`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is used with three arguments:
   - Start: `len(ar) - 1`
   - Stop: `-1`
   - Step: `-1`

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if the start value is greater than or equal to the stop value.
   - In this case, the loop will execute if `len(ar) - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `len(ar) > 0`.

4. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ar` must have at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will start at `len(ar) - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `ar` must be a non-empty list.
- `i` will be initialized to `len(ar) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
