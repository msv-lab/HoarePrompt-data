Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where each element of `a` is defined as \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of the permutation up to index `i`.

2. **Reversing the Process**: To find `p`, we need to reverse the process of constructing `a`. Given \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), we can rearrange this to find \( p_i \):
   \[
   p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i
   \]

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX when considering the entire permutation. This is because initially, all numbers from 0 to n-1 are potential candidates for MEX.

4. **Backward Construction**: The program iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates \( p_i \) using the formula \( p_i = mex - ar[i] \). It then updates `mex` to the newly calculated \( p_i \) if it is smaller than the current `mex`.

5. **Output**: After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the elements of `res`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints well, including the possibility of multiple valid permutations. Since the problem guarantees at least one valid permutation, the program should always produce a valid result.

7. **Efficiency**: The program uses a single pass through the array `ar` and performs constant-time operations for each element, making it efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
