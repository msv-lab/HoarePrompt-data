To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
2. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is also not directly used in the code snippet.
3. `n` is an input integer. This represents the length of the list `ar`.
4. `ar` is a list of integers derived from user input. The exact values of `ar` are not specified, but it is a list of integers of length `n`.
5. `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
6. `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `mex`**:
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]`.
   - To find `mex`, we need to consider the values of `ar` and how they affect the list `[mex - ar[i]]`.

2. **Calculate `res`**:
   - For each `i` from 0 to \(n-1\), `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - The exact values of `res` depend on the values of `ar` and the value of `mex`.

3. **Print `res`**:
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space.
   - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `n = 3` and `ar = [1, 2, 3]`.
- We need to find `mex` such that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(3)]`.

#### Finding `mex`:
- If `mex = 0`, then the list `[mex - ar[i]]` would be `[-1, -2, -3]`. The smallest non-negative integer not in this list is 0, but since `mex` cannot be 0 (it must be the smallest non-negative integer not in the list), we try the next value.
- If `mex = 1`, then the list `[mex - ar[i]]` would be `[0, -1, -2]`. The smallest non-negative integer not in this list is 1, but since `mex` cannot be 1, we try the next value.
- If `mex = 2`, then the list `[mex - ar[i]]` would be `[1, 0, -1]`. The smallest non-negative integer not in this list is 2, which is valid.

So, `mex = 2`.

#### Calculate `res`:
- `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 2 = 0`
- `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 2 - 3 = -1`

Thus, `res = [1, 0, -1]`.

#### Print `res`:
- The `print` statement will convert `res` to a space-separated string: `"1 0 -1"`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 0 -1 (where the values depend on the specific values of `ar` and the calculated `mex`)**

This output format ensures that the result is clear and understandable, reflecting the precise values based on the given conditions.
