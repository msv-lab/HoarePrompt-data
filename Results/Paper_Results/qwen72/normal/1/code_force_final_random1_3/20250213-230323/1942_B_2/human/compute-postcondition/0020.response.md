The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, and the variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`
- `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`**
