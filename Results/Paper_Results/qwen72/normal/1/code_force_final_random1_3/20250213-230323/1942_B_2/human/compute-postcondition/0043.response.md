The code snippet initializes the list `res` to a list of `n` elements, all set to `None`. This operation does not affect the values of `_`, `t`, `ar`, `mex`, or `i`.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements all set to `None`, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`), and `i` is -1.**
