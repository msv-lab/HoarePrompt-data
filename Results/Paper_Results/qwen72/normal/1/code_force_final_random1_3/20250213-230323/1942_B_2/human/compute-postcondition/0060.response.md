Output State: **_ is t-1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]`, and `i` is -1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times as specified by the initial number of test cases. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. For each test case, the variable `n` is an integer input by the user, and `ar` is a list of integers also provided by the user. The list `res` contains `n` elements, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]`. The index `i` is -1, which is the final state of the inner loop's index after processing all elements in `ar`.
