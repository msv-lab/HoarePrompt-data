To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `len(ar) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `ar` has at least one element.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.
4. **State of `ar`**: The list `ar` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.
- **`ar`**: Must have at least one element.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is equal to `t`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
