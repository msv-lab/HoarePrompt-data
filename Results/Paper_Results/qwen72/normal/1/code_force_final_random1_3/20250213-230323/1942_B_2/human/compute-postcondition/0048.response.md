Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[-1]` is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n - ar[-1]`, `i` is -1, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` is true.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `i` is -1, `ar[i]` refers to the last element of the list `ar`.
- Therefore, `mex` is now `n - ar[-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
