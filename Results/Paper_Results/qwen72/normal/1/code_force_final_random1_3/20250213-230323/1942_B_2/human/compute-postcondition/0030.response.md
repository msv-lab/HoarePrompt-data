The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `ar`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `ar`. The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, and it must still be within the valid range (i.e., `i >= 0`). Therefore, `i` should now be `len(ar) - 2`.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
