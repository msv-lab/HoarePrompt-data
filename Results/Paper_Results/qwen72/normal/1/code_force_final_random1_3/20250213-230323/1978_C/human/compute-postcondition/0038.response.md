The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `k` is `k - n + 4`
- `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`
- The list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning
- If `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`) from the end of the list `l`, and `x` is no longer at the beginning of the list `l`
- If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned with `x` inserted at the beginning, and `x` is the last element of the list `l`

After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the last element of the list `l` is removed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 4`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning, if `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`) from the end of the list `l`, and `x` is no longer at the beginning of the list `l`, if `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned with `x` inserted at the beginning, and the last element of the list `l` has been removed.**
