Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.** 

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated by the function call `func_3(2, l)` before being returned. The exact value of `l` depends on the implementation of `func_3`, which is not provided here. However, the output state clearly indicates that the program returns whatever `func_3(2, l)` computes.
