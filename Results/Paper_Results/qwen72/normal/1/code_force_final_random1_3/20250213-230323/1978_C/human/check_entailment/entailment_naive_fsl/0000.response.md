Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**: The function `func_4` checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` if it is. However, this is incorrect because the problem does not state that `k` must be even. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the permutation `[3, 1, 2]` is valid, but the program would incorrectly return "NO".

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**: The maximum `k` value is calculated differently for even and odd `n`. This calculation is not correct. For example, for `n = 4`, the maximum `k` should be 6 (achieved by the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]`), but the program calculates it as 8.

3. **Permutation Generation Logic**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_3` for generating the permutation is flawed. It does not always produce a valid permutation that meets the required `k` value. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 6`, the program might not generate a valid permutation.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, for `n = 1` and `k = 0`, the program should return the permutation `[1]`, but it might not handle this case correctly.

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
