Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and `k` is now `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`. `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2 and `l` is the initial value of `l`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is 2, `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` with `c` being 2 and `l` being the initial value of `l`.***
