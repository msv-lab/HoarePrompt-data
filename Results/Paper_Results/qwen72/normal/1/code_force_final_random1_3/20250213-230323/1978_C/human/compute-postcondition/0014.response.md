Functionality: ** The function `func_4` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds a calculated maximum value (`max_k`) based on `n`. If these conditions are not met, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12. The maximum value `max_k` is determined based on whether `n` is odd or even. **
