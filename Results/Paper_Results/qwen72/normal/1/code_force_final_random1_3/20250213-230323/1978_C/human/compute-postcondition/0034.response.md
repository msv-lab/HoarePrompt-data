Output State: **The program returns the list `l` which now contains the element `x` at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`), and `x` is no longer the last element of the list `l`. The list `l` has been modified such that the element `x` is placed at the specified index, and the rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged except for the removal of `x` from its original position at the end of the list.**
