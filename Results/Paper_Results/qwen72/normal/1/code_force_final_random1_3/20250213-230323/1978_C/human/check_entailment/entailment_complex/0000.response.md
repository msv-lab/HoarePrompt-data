Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even, and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating an invalid input. Otherwise, it returns the valid `n` and `k`. This function correctly handles the input validation and constraints.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`. It divides `k` by 2 and iterates over the list `l` (which is initially a sorted list from 1 to `n`). It performs swaps to adjust the Manhattan value. The function correctly handles the logic for constructing the permutation and ensuring the Manhattan value matches `k`.

3. **Function `func_2` and `func_3`**: These functions perform specific swaps in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value. They are called conditionally within `func_1` to achieve the desired permutation. The swaps are performed correctly based on the indices specified.

4. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints the result. If a valid permutation is found, it prints "YES" followed by the permutation. If no valid permutation is found, it prints "NO". This function correctly handles the output format.

5. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the entire process. It calls `func_4` to get valid `n` and `k`, checks if they are valid, and then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation. Finally, it calls `func_5` to print the result. This function correctly handles the flow of the program.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. Each function performs its intended task, and the overall flow of the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
