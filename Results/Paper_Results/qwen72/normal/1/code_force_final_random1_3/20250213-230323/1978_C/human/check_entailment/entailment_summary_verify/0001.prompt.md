You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l

#Function 3:
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, and then passes the result to `func_5`. The function does not modify any global state and does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_4**: This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value must be even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that achieves the required Manhattan value `k`. It uses a series of swaps to adjust the permutation.
   - **func_2** and **func_3**: These functions perform specific swaps in the permutation list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_6**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate the input, then `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_4** correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`.
   - **func_1** attempts to construct the permutation by making swaps. However, the logic in `func_1` is complex and may not always produce the correct permutation. Specifically, the loop and swap conditions might not cover all edge cases.
   - **func_2** and **func_3** perform specific swaps, but their correctness depends on the logic in `func_1`.
   - **func_6** correctly handles the overall flow and output.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation is not straightforward and might fail for certain edge cases or large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not always lead to the correct permutation.
   - The swap operations in `func_2` and `func_3` might not always result in the desired Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and potential issues in the permutation construction logic, the program might not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not guaranteed.
