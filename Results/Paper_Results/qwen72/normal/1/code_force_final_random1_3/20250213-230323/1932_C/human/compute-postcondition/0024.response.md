Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, once for each element in the string `s`.
- For each iteration, if `s[i]` is 'L', the element `a[l]` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[i]` is 'R', the element `a[r]` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented by 1.
- After `n` iterations, `b` will contain `n` elements, each taken from either the start or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`.
- The variable `l` will be `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise it will be some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`.
- The variable `r` will be -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise it will be some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`.
- The loop index `i` will be `n - 1` after the final iteration.
