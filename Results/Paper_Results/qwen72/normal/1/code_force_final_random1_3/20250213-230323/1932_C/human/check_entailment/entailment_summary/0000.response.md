Reasoning:  
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required remainders. However, there is a discrepancy in how the remainders are calculated and appended to the list `b`. According to the problem statement, the program should output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at the start of each command, not just the element being removed. The current implementation appends the element being removed to `b` directly, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` at the start of each command and then append the result of this product modulo `m` to the list `b`.

However, the final part of the function where it calculates the cumulative product in reverse and returns the results in the correct order is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem statement because it does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements before each command.

Correctness: **False**
