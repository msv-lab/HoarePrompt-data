Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given by the string `s` ('L' or 'R') to create a new list `b`. Then, it computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` in reverse order. The returned list `ans` contains `n` elements, each representing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point, modulo `m`. **
