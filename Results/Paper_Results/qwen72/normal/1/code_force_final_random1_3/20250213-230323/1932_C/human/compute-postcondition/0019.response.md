The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` of the list `a` to the list `b`. Let's break down the impact:

- `n` and `m` remain positive integers within their specified ranges.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^4.
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- `b` is updated by appending the element `a[l]`.
- `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 1 if `s[0]` is 'R'.
- `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R'.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 2.

Based on the initial state:
- If `s[0]` is 'L', then `l` is 2, and `b` will append `a[2]`.
- If `s[0]` is 'R', then `l` is 1, and `b` will append `a[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list that now contains the element `a[l]` (where `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or 1 if `s[0]` is 'R'), `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 1 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
