You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is 0. The list `ans` contains `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The variable `p` is the final value of this cumulative product, which is the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` contains `n` elements, each being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The cumulative product is calculated as the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a list `ans` in reverse order, where each element in `ans` is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` contains `n` elements, each being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The cumulative product is calculated as the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
