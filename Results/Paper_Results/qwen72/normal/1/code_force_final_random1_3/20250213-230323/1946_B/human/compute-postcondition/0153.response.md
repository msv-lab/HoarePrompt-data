Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `smin` is updated as required, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`, `sm` is now `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `smin`, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `sm` is greater than or equal to 0 still holds true after the update.
