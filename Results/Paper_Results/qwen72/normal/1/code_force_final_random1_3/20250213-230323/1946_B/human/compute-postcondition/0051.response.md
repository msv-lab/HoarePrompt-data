To determine what will be printed by the `print(sm)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements. The elements of `smin` are such that for each index `i` (from 0 to `n`), `smin[i]` is the minimum value of `suf[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `i + 1`.
   - `sm` is initially `2 + suf[n]`.

2. **Update Logic for `sm`:**
   - If `sm` (which is initially `2 + suf[n]`) is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `2 + suf[n] + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

Let's analyze the steps:

- **Calculate `suf[n]`:**
  - `suf[n]` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `l`.

- **Initial Value of `sm`:**
  - `sm = 2 + suf[n]`

- **Check if `sm` is less than 0:**
  - If `sm < 0`, update `sm` to `2 + suf[n] + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
  - If `sm >= 0`, update `sm` to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

### Example Calculation:
Assume `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 4`:
- `suf = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]` (since `suf[1] = l[0]`, `suf[2] = l[0] + l[1]`, etc.)
- `suf[n] = suf[4] = 10`
- `sm = 2 + 10 = 12`

Since `sm` is not less than 0:
- `sm = 12 % 10 = 2`

### General Case:
- If `suf[n]` is such that `2 + suf[n]` is non-negative, `sm` will be `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.
- If `2 + suf[n]` is negative, `sm` will be adjusted to a positive value using the formula `2 + suf[n] + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the update logic, the value of `sm` will be either `(2 + suf[n]) % 10` if `2 + suf[n]` is non-negative, or a positive value derived from the adjustment formula if `2 + suf[n]` is negative.

Output: **sm (where sm is the result of the update logic applied to 2 + suf[n])**
