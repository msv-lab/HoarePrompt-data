The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop iterates over the range defined by `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust `j` and consider the condition based on `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The value of `sm` has been updated based on the conditions given. However, these details (`i`, `n`, and `sm`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the loop's execution directly.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `j`.

Given that `j` was in the range of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, the next state would be:

- `j` is incremented by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, if `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`, otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` must be greater than `j + 1`**
