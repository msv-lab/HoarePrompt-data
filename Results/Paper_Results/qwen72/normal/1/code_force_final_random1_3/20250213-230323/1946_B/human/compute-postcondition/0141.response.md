Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `smin` is initialized as required, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`, `sm` is `suf[1] - smin[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]` because `i` is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `smin`, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
