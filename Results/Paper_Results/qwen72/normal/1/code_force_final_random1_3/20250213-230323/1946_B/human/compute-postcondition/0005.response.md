The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer, storing the result in the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `j` is 0
- `b` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`

After executing the code snippet, the new state is:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `j` is 0
- `b` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
- `l` is a list of integers from the input

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
