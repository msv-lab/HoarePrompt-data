Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `smin` is initialized as required, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`. `sm` is now `suf[2] - smin[2]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[2] - smin[2]` based on the given code. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
