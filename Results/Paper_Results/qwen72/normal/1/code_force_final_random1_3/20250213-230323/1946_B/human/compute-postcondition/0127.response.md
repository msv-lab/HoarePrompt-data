Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `smin` has an additional element at the end which is `smin[i]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. This means that the list `smin` now has an additional element at the end, which is the same as the element at index `i` in `smin`. The conditions regarding `suf[i + 1]` and `smin[i]` are not relevant to the given code snippet, so they do not affect the output state. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, except that `i` is incremented by 1 from its initial state.
