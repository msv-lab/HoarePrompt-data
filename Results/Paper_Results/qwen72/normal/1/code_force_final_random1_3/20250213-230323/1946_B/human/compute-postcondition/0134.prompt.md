Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n - 1`, `suf` now includes `n` additional elements where each element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`. The values of `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, `sm`, and `smin` are `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`. Otherwise, if `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`. Otherwise, if `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `smin` is updated. If `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, `smin` now includes the element `suf[i + 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `smin` has one more element, which is the value of `smin[i]` at the current index `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
