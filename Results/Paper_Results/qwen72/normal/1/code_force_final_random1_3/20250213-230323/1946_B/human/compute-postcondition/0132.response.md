The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. This means that the list `smin` will now have one additional element, which is the value of `smin[i]` at the current index `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration
- `smin` has been updated according to the conditions described in the task

After executing the code:
- The list `smin` will have one more element, which is the value of `smin[i]` at the current index `i`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged (it was already incremented before this line of code).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `smin` has one more element, which is the value of `smin[i]` at the current index `i`.**
