Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n - 1`, `suf` now includes `n` additional elements where each element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`. The values of `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `sm` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially because it defines the number of iterations.
- The variable `i` ends up being `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- The list `suf` now has `n` additional elements, each of which is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
- The values of `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `sm` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged from their initial values.
