The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `suf` now includes an additional element which is `suf[0] + l[0]`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `suf` now includes an additional element which is `suf[0] + l[0]`**
