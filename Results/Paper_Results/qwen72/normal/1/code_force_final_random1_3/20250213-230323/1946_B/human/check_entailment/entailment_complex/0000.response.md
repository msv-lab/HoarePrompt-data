Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing a specified number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution must handle multiple test cases and ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums (`suf`) of the array, which is a common technique for efficiently computing subarray sums.
3. **Minimum Prefix Sum Tracking**: The program tracks the minimum prefix sum (`smin`) up to each index, which helps in finding the maximum subarray sum.
4. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum subarray sum (`sm`) by iterating through the prefix sums and using the minimum prefix sum to find the largest difference.
5. **Operation Application**: The program applies the operations by multiplying the maximum subarray sum by \(2^k\) and adjusting the result to account for the initial sum of the array.
6. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures the final result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Multiplication by \(2^k\)**: The line `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` might lead to overflow issues for large values of `k`. However, since the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), this should not cause an issue.
2. **Negative Result Handling**: The program handles negative results by adding a multiple of \(10^9 + 7\) to make the result non-negative, which is correct.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.
- The logic for calculating the maximum subarray sum and applying the operations is sound.
- The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
