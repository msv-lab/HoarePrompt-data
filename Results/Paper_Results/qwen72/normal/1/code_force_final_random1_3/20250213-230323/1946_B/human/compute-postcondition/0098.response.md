Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `a` is `abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`.
- `sm` was initially `(2 + suf[n])` and is less than 0. After the code execution, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- `a` is calculated as `abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10`. This value is used in the calculation of the new `sm`.
