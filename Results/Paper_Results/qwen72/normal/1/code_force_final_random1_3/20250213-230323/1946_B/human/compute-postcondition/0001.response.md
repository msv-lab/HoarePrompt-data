To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `t`.

- `t` represents the number of test cases and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- `j` is the loop variable and should start at 0 for the loop to begin.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `j` is not explicitly initialized, but it will be managed by the `range(t)` function.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `j` will start at 0 as per the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
