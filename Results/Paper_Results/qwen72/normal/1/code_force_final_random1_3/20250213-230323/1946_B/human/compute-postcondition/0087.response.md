The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be such that `i < n + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0 for the condition `i < n + 1` to hold true.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.**
