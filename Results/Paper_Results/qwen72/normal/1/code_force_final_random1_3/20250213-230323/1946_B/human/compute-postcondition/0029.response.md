Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is 2, and `smin` is a list containing four elements. If `suf[3] < smin[2]`, then `smin` contains the elements 0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`, and `suf[3]`. Otherwise, `smin` contains the elements 0, 0, 0, and 0.***
