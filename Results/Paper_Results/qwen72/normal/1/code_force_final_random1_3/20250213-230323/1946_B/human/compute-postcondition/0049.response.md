Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements. The elements of `smin` are such that for each index `i` (from 0 to `n`), `smin[i]` is the minimum value of `suf[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `i + 1`, `sm` is now `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `i`, `smin`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `sm` is calculated using the modulo operation, ensuring that `sm` remains within the range `[0, 10 ** 9 + 6]`.
