### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the array `l`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `suf`. This is done correctly using the loop:
     ```python
     suf = [0]
     for i in range(n):
         suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
     ```

3. **Minimum Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function maintains a list `smin` to keep track of the minimum prefix sum up to each index. This is done correctly using the loop:
     ```python
     smin = [0]
     for i in range(n):
         if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
             smin.append(suf[i + 1])
         else:
             smin.append(smin[i])
     ```

4. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the maximum subarray sum using the difference between the current prefix sum and the minimum prefix sum up to that point. This is done correctly using the loop:
     ```python
     sm = -111
     for i in range(n + 1):
         if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
             sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
     ```

5. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the final sum after `k` operations. However, there is a mistake in the formula used:
     ```python
     sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
     ```
     This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     ```python
     sm = (2 ** k - 1) * sm
     ```
     This is because each operation effectively doubles the maximum subarray sum and adds it to the original sum.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The function correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the range of \(10^9 + 7\):
     ```python
     if sm < 0:
         a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
         sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
     else:
         sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)
     ```

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but has a mistake in the formula used to calculate the final sum after `k` operations. The correct formula should be \( (2^k - 1) \times \text{sm} \).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
