The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- Depending on the condition, `smin` was updated based on the value of `suf[i + 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`. Otherwise, if `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.**
