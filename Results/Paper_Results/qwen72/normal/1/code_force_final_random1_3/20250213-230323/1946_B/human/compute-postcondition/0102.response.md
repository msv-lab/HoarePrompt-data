To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `sm` is updated based on the following conditions:
     - If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
     - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sm)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - We need to determine the value of `sm` based on the given conditions.
   - The value of `sm` depends on the value of `suf[n]` and the current value of `sm`.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `sm` is less than 0:**
     - `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
     - This formula adds a multiple of 10 to the value of `(2 + suf[n])` to ensure `sm` becomes a positive number.
   - **Case 2: `sm` is greater than or equal to 0:**
     - `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.
     - This formula takes the last digit of `(2 + suf[n])`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `suf[n]` and the initial value of `sm` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - If `sm` is less than 0, the output will be `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, the output will be `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **sm (where sm is either (2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10 if sm < 0, or (2 + suf[n]) % 10 if sm >= 0)**
