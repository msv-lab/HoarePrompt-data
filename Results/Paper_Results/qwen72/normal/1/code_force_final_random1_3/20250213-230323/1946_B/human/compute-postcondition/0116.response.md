Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `suf` now includes three additional elements: `suf[0] + l[0]`, `suf[1] + l[1]`, and `suf[2] + l[2]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Since `i` is 2, the new element added to `suf` is `suf[2] + l[2]`. The initial state specified that `suf` already includes two additional elements: `suf[0] + l[0]` and `suf[1] + l[1]`. After executing the code, `suf` now includes these three elements. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
