The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, `suf`, `j`, or `t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, if `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`, otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` must be greater than `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
