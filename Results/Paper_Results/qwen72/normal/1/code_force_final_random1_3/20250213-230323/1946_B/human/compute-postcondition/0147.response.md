Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `smin` is updated as required, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`. `sm` is now `2 ** k * sm - sm`.**

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to `2 ** k * sm - sm`. This means `sm` is multiplied by `2 ** k` and then subtracted by its original value. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `smin`, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]`) remain unchanged.
