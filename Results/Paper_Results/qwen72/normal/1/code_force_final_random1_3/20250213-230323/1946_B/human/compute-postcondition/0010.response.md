The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 1), and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing two elements `[0, l[0]]`, `i` is 1**
