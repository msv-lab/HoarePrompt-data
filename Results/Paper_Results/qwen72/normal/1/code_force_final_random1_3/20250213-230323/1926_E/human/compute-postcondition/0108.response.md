The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts at least two parameters, `n` and `k`, and possibly a third parameter `t` representing the number of test cases. Each of these parameters has specific constraints: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

Given these constraints, the function's output is not specified in the problem statement. However, typically, such functions would process the input parameters and return a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each of the `t` test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.**
