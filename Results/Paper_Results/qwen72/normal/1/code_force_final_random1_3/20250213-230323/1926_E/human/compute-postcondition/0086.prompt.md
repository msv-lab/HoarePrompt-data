Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is an empty list, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined. The condition that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` is either met or not met for each iteration, and the corresponding output is printed if the condition is met.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    m = (n + 1) // 2
    n -= m
    L.append(m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, but after the last iteration, `n` must still be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `m`, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and must be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n_initial - ((n_initial + 1) // 2) - ((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, and `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, and `n` must be greater than 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
