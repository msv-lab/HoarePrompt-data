Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` will be the sum of the series \((d + 1) // 2\) for each iteration until `s` is no longer less than `k` or `d` becomes 0, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `d` will be 0 or a value such that adding \((d + 1) // 2\) to `s` would make `s` exceed or equal `k`, `h` will be 0, `p` will be equal to `i`, `g` will be the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `k` remains greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` will be equal to `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\). If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `_` is set to iterate over a range derived from a positive integer input, ensuring the loop executes at least once, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are input integers. If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `p` is updated to `i`, `g` is incremented by the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, and `h` is decremented by the same amount for each iteration. `f` is updated to `k - g`, and `y` is updated to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\). The other variables (`n`, `s`, `d`, `k`, `i`) retain their original values. If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are input integers, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0. If `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is `2`. Otherwise, `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and the values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
