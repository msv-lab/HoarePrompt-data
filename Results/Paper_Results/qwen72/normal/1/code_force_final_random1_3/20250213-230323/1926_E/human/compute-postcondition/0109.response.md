Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then generates a sequence of values by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0. The function checks if the value `k` falls within a specific range defined by the cumulative sum of the generated sequence. If the condition is met, it prints a calculated value based on the position of `k` within the sequence. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the final state includes `t` being 0, `n` being 0 for the last test case, and `k` being the last input integer for the final test case. **
