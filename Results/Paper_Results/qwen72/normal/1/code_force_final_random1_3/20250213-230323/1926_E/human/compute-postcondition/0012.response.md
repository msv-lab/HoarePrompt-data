To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop condition and the current state:

### Given Loop Condition:
```python
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Current State:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.
2. **Current Value of `n`**: The current value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be non-zero after the adjustment.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Value of `n`**: Let's denote the initial value of `n` before the adjustment as `n_initial`.
2. **Current Value of `n`**: After the previous iteration, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
3. **Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `n` must be non-zero.

Let's calculate the new value of `n`:
- If `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, then for the loop to execute again, `n - (n + 1) // 2` must be greater than 0.

### Simplifying the Condition:
- `n - (n + 1) // 2 > 0`
- This simplifies to `n > (n + 1) // 2`

For this inequality to hold, `n` must be greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. This is always true for positive integers because `(n + 1) // 2` is the floor division of `n + 1` by 2, which is always less than `n` when `n` is positive.

### Conclusion:
Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, and the current state already ensures that `n` is non-zero (as it is `n - (n + 1) // 2`), no further adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
