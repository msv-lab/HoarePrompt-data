Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0. If `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration of the loop, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is `2`. Otherwise, `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and the values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged.***
