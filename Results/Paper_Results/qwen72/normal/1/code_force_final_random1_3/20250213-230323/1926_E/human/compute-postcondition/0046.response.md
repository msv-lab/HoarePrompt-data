Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2) - m`, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is `[m, m]`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined, `m` is `((n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is appended to the list `L`, which initially contains only `[m]`. After appending, `L` becomes `[m, m]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
