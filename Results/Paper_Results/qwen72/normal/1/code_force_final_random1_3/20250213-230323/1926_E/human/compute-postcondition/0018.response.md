Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `pow` is assigned the value 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `tot` are still valid.
- The new value of `pow` is 1.
