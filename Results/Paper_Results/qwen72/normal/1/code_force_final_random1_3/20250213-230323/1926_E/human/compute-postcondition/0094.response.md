Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pow` is updated from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, `m`) retain their initial values and conditions.
