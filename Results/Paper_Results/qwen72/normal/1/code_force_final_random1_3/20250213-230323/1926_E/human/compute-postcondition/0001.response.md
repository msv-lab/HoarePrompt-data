The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `n` and `k` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, but they must still satisfy the given constraints for each test case.

Given that `t` is an integer value provided by the user input and is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
