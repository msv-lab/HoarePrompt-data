Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2) - m - m`, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is `[m, m, m]`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The list `L` initially contains `[m, m]`.
- The code `L.append(m)` adds another `m` to the list `L`.
- Therefore, `L` now contains `[m, m, m]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`, `a`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
