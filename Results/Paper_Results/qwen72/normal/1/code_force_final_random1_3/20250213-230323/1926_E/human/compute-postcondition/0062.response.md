Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values generated by repeatedly dividing `n_input` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0, `L` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is the first element in `L`, `pow` is 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
