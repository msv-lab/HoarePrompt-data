Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is an empty list, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - m`.
- Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
