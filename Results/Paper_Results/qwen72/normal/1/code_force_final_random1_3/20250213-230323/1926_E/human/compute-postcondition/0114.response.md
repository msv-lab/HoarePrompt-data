Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` and `k` are input integers and both must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, and `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are input parameters.
- `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`.
- `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`.
- `h` is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` in each iteration, eventually becoming 0.
- `p` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it will be equal to `i` when the loop finishes.
- `g` accumulates the value of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration of the loop.
