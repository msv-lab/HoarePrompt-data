Postcondition: ***`even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least two elements, `gap` is the second element in `even`, `ans` is increased by the first element in `even`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is further increased by `2 * 0`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is decreased by the first element in `even` // 2.***
