Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates the minimum number of operations needed to ensure that no two adjacent elements in the list have a difference of 2, considering the constraints on `y`. The function prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum of the calculated value and `n - 2`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
