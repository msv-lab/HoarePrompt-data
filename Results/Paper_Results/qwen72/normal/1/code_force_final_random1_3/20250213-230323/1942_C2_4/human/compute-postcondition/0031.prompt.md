Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `tmp` is an empty list. If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`. Additionally, if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `tmp` is updated to contain one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `tmp` is a list. If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `tmp` is updated to contain one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y - (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 + 1` and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list, and `ii` is 0. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
