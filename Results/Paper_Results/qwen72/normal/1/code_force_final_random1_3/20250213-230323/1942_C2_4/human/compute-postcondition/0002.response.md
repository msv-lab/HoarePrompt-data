The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This means the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)
- `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- The list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n]
- `tt` must be greater than 0
- `ii` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- The constraints for `n`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
