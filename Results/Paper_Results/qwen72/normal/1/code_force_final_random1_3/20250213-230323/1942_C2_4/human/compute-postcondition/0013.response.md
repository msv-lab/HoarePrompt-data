Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `i` is 1, the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not equal to 2, and the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is even, and `y` is greater than half of the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` minus 1.**
