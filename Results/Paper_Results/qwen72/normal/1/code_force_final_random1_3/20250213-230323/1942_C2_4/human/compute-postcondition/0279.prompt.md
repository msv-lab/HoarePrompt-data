Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`, `ans` remains `x - 2`, `odd` is now a sorted list of all the odd gaps greater than 1 found during the loop, and `even` is now a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 found during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap`, `odd` is a sorted list of all the odd gaps greater than 1 found during the loop and must contain at least one element, `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 found during the loop, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, if `y` < `gap // 2` then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by 2 times the previous value of `y` (which was `y` decreased by `gap // 2`), `ans` is further increased by `gap`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
