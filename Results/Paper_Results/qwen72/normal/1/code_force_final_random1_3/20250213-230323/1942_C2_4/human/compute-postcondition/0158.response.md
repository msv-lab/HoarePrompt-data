Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, `cons` will be the final computed value for each test case, which is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `val`, `sx`, and `c` will have been reset and recalculated for each test case, but their final values will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- **`cons`**: For each test case, `cons` is calculated as the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`. This value is printed for each test case.
- **`n`, `x`, `y`**: These variables are reinitialized for each test case from the input. Their final values will be the last values read from the input.
- **`l`**: This list is populated with the `x` distinct integers from the input, sorted, and then an additional element `n + l[0]` is appended. It is reset for each test case.
- **`val`**: This list is populated with the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. It is sorted based on a custom key and is reset for each test case.
- **`sx`**: This variable is initialized to 0 and incremented based on the conditions inside the loop. It is reset for each test case.
- **`c`**: This variable is the result of `i // 2` and is used to update `y` and `sx`. It is recalculated for each element in `val` and is reset for each test case.

The final state of these variables will reflect the results of processing all the test cases, with `t` being 0 and `cons` containing the computed value for each test case.
