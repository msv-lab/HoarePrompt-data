Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values generated by repeatedly dividing `n_input` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined because `L` is not empty.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values generated by repeatedly dividing `n_input` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0, `L` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, and the condition that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` is either met or not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values generated by repeatedly dividing `n_input` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0, `L` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is the sum of the first and second elements in `L`, `pow` is 4. If `tot` (updated) is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values generated by repeatedly dividing `n_input` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0, `L` has at least 2 elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is the sum of the first, second, and third elements in `L`, and `pow` is 8. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
