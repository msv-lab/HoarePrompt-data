Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element `[m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `L`) remain unchanged.
- The list `L` still contains one element, which is now the updated value of `m`.
