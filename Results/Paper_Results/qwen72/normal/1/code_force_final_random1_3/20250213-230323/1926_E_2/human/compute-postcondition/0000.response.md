The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The constraints for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) remain valid, and the conditions for `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) are unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
