Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
