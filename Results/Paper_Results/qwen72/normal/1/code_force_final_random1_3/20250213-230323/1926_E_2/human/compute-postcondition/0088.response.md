Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `a` is undefined, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `pow`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific values and conditions for these variables are retained as they were in the initial state.
