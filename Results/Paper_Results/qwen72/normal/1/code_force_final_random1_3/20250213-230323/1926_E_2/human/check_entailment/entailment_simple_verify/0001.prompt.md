You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires laying down cards in a specific order: first the odd numbers, then the even numbers that are multiples of 2, then the multiples of 3, and so on.
   - We need to find the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of cards and `k` is the position of the card we need to find.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - The while loop continues until `n` becomes zero, which means all cards have been processed.
     - In each iteration, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step.
     - It subtracts `m` from `n` to update the remaining number of cards.
     - It appends `m` to the list `L`.
   - After the while loop, it initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - The for loop iterates over the list `L` to find the k-th card:
     - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it prints the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
     - It updates `tot` by adding `a` and multiplies `pow` by 2 for the next iteration.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of cards laid down at each step and stores these values in `L`.
   - The for loop correctly identifies the step where the k-th card is laid down and uses the formula to calculate the value of the k-th card.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly maps the position `k` to the corresponding card value.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `n`.
   - It also handles large values of `n` and `k` efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the k-th card laid down according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
