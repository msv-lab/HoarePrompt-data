Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by calculating the sequence in which the cards are laid down according to the rules specified. The program constructs the sequence step-by-step, keeping track of the total number of cards laid down and the current multiplier (`pow`), and it correctly identifies the k-th card laid down for each test case. The logic and the flow of the program align with the requirements and the example provided.
