Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `m` is appended to the list `L`, which was initially empty.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged or undefined as specified in the initial state.
