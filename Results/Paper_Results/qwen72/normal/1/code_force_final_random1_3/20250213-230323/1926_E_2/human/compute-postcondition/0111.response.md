Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers and both must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` must be at least 4, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is now 3, `g` is now `g + (h + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `g += (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `g` by adding `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `g` is `g + (h + 1) // 2`.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid and unchanged.
