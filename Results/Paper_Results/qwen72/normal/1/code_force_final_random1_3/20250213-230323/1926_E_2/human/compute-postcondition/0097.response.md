Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` has at least one element, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, and `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current conditions remain unchanged.***
