The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts at least two parameters: `n` and `k`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each of these parameters has specific constraints: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to process these inputs and produce some output. Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of the function's behavior based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
