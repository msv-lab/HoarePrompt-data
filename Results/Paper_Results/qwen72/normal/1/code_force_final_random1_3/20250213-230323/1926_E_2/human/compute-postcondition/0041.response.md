The value of `n` is decremented by `m`. Given that `m` is defined as `(n_input + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)`, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined because `L` is empty, `m` is `(n_input + 1) // 2`.**
