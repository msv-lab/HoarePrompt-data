Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` has at least one element, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4, and `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
