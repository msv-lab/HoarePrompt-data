The value of `pow` is updated to `pow * 2`. Given that `pow` was initially 4, it is now 8. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is `a + a + a`, `pow` is 8, `a` is the third element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as initially stated.**
