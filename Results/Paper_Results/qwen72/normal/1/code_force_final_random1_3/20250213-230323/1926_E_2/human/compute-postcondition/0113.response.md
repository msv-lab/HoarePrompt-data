Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers and both must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the series of values calculated by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` must be at least 4, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` would make `s` exceed `k`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is now 4, `g` is now `g + (h + 1) // 2`.**
