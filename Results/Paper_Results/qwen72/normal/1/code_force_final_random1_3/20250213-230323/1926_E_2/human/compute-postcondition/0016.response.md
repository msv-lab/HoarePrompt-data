Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: After all iterations, `n` will be 0 because the loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
- **`k`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`L`**: The list `L` will contain a sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]`, where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration. Here, `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration. The loop appends these values to `L` until `n` becomes 0.
