Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.***
