Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user.
- If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is set to `a // 2`.
- `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`.
- If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable Initialization and Conditions:**
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user.
   - If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`.
   - `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2`.
   - The condition `if a1 != b` checks if `a1` is not equal to `b`. If this condition is true, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop is not explicitly shown in the code snippet, but the condition `if a1 != b` suggests that there is a loop where this condition is checked.
   - If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the loop skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is outside any conditional block related to the loop or the condition `if a1 != b`.
   - This means that the `print('Yes')` statement will always execute, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, or `b1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Yes')` statement will always print "Yes" because it is not conditioned on the values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, or `b1`.

Output: **Yes**
