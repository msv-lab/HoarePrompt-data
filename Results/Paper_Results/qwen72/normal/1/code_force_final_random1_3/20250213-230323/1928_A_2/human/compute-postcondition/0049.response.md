Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user.
   - If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is set to `a // 2`.
   - If `b` is even, `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`.
   - If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.
   - If `b` is odd, the program continues with the current iteration without modifying `b1` or `b2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('No')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`, the `print` statement will always print the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
