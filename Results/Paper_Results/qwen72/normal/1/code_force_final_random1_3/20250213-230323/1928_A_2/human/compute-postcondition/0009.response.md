Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are updated to positive integers provided by the input.
- `i` is 0.
- The input value must be a positive integer.
- Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd.
- The condition \((a - b == -a, a)\) or \((b - a == -b, b)\) is false.
- The difference between `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., \((a - b) \% 2\) is either greater than 0 or less than 0).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and constraints on the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **yes**
