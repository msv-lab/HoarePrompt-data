Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, `i` is 0, and the input value must be a positive integer. Additionally, either `a` is odd or `b` is odd. If the condition \((a - b == -a, a)\) or \((b - a == -b, b)\) is true, then either `a - b == -a` and the value of `a` is used, or `b - a == -b` and the value of `b` is used. Otherwise, if the condition is false, the difference between `a` and `b` remains non-divisible by 2 if it was initially non-divisible, and remains divisible by 2 if it was initially divisible.***
