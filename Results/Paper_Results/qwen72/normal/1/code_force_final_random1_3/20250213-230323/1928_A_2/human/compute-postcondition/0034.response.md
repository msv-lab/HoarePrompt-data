The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, we can infer that the function likely processes these parameters in some way and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `a` and `b` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
