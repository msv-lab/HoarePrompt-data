Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is even, the function checks if dividing the even number by 2 results in a value that is not equal to the other number. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'. This process repeats for all `t` test cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further state changes occur. **
