Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations executed, and the values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input provided for each iteration. For each iteration, if `a` or `b` is even, `a1` and `b1` are set to half of `a` and `b` respectively (if they are even). The program prints 'Yes' if `a1` is not equal to `b` or `b1` is not equal to `a`, and 'No' otherwise. The loop continues until all `t` iterations are completed.**

In natural language, this means:
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be zero because the loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are read from the input.
- If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2` and `a2` is set to `a // 2`.
- If `b` is even, `b1` is set to `b // 2` and `b2` is set to `b // 2`.
- The program checks if `a1` is not equal to `b` or if `b1` is not equal to `a`. If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes' and moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
- This process repeats until all `t` iterations are completed.
