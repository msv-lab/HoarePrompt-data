Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even, but this is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as 2x4. However, the program would incorrectly output "yes" for such cases.

2. The conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and do not make logical sense in the context of the problem. These conditions are always false because they compare a tuple to a boolean value, which is not valid.

3. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1), and the condition will always evaluate to true, leading to incorrect outputs.

A correct approach would be to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, no such rearrangement is possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This program correctly checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints "yes" if so, otherwise "no".
