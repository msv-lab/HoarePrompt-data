Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has some logical flaws and inefficiencies.
- The function `func_14` is supposed to generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. However, the logic used to construct the sequence is flawed.
- Specifically, the handling of the case when `k == 1` is incorrect. The program returns a fixed sequence `[2, 3]` for `n > 2`, which does not necessarily meet the requirement that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k` and that all values from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) should have a subsequence.
- Additionally, the construction of the sequence for `k != 1` is also problematic. The sequence generated may not always meet the requirement that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.
- The program also does not handle the constraint that the sequence should have a size of at most 25, and it may generate sequences that are too long or do not meet the problem's requirements.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to be revised to correctly handle the construction of the sequence for both `k == 1` and `k != 1` cases, ensuring that the sequence meets all the problem's constraints.
