The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `l` must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `l` must still be greater than 4.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be greater than 4. The current value of `k` is 1. `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. `i` is 4**
