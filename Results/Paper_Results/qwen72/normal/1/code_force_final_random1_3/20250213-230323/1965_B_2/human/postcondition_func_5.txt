The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing newline character, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns this string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a single line of input has been read and processed, and the function has returned a string representation of this line without any trailing newline characters.
