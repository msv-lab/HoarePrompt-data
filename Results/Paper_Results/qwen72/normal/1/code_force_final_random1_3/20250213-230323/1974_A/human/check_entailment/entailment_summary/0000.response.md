Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons. The logic involves calculating the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons first, and then checking if the remaining space on these screens can accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, additional screens are calculated.

However, there is a logical error in the program. Specifically, the variable `m` is intended to represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons, but the calculation `15 * z - y * 4` is incorrect. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Therefore, the correct calculation should be `15 * z - 4 * y`.

Additionally, the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. It should be `if m < x:` because `x` represents the number of 1x1 icons, not `a` (which is the number of test cases).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2  # Number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        m = 15 * z - 4 * y  # Remaining space on these screens
        if m < x:
            z += (x - m + 14) // 15  # Additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(z)
```

Given the original program's logical errors, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
