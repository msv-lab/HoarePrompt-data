### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula determines the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the number of screens required is the ceiling of `y / 2`. This part is correct.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so the total space used by 2x2 icons is `y * 4`. The remaining space is then `15 * z - y * 4`. This part is also correct.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. It should be `if m < x:` instead. This is a critical error because it affects the logic for determining how many additional screens are needed to fit the 1x1 icons.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens `z` is printed for each test case. However, due to the incorrect condition, the number of screens might be calculated incorrectly.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The calculation for the remaining space and adjusting for 1x1 icons is also correct, but the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect and should be `if m < x:`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the condition `if m < a:`. After correcting this to `if m < x:`, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the condition).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
