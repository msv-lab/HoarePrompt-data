Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is `15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `z = (y + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(y + 1) // 2` to `z`. This updates the value of `z` from its previous potential value to the new value `(y + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
