The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems to operate within a context where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, it's assumed that they are handled internally or through external means (e.g., input from a file or user input).

Given the lack of explicit return statements in the provided snippet, the exact output cannot be determined without additional context. However, based on typical programming practices, the function likely processes each test case defined by `x` and `y` and returns or prints some result for each case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). It returns or prints a result for each test case.**
