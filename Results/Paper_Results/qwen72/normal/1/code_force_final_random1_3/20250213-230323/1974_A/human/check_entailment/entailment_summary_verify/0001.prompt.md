You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, computes a value `z` based on these inputs, and prints `z`. The computation of `z` involves adjusting its value based on a condition involving `m`, which is derived from `y` and `x`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result for each one, and the state of the program includes the processed values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `z` for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula determines the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the number of screens required is the ceiling of `y / 2`.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so the total space used by 2x2 icons is `y * 4`. The remaining space is then `15 * z - y * 4`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This ensures that all 1x1 icons fit into the available screens.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens `z` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The calculation for the remaining space and adjusting for 1x1 icons is also correct.
- However, there is a potential issue in the condition `if m < a:`. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. It should be `if m < x:` instead.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the condition `if m < a:`. After correcting this to `if m < x:`, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the condition).
