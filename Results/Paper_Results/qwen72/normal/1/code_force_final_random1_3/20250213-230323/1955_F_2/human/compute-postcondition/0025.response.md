Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is `2 * math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the third element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `2 * math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, which simplifies to `3 * math.floor(x / 2)`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.
