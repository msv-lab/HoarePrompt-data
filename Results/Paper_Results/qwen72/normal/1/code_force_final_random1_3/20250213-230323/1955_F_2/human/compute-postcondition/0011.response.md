Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `p` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. It then processes these counts to determine and print a value for each test case. The value printed is the sum of two components: 1) 1 if the first three elements of `p` (after being adjusted to the nearest even number) have an odd sum, and 0 otherwise; 2) half the sum of the adjusted `p` values. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
