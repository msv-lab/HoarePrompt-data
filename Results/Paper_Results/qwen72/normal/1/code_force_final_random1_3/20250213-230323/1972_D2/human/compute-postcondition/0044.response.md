Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. `n` is at least 20, and `m` is at least 5.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- The values of `x`, `cnt`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and constraints specified in the initial state remain valid.
