Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 8, m // 8)`.** 

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
