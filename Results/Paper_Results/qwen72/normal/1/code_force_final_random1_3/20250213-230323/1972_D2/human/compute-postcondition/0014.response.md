The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. Since the GCD of `x` (which is 1) and the new value of `y` (which is 3) is still 1, `cnt` is set to the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.**
