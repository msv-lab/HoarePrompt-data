The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraint, it seems there might be a misunderstanding because the function signature does not include any parameters. Assuming the function internally uses a variable `t` which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the function's output is not specified in the given context.

Since the output is not provided, I cannot accurately describe the return value. However, if we assume that the function is supposed to return something based on `t`, the description would need more specific information about what the function returns.

Given the current information, the best I can provide is:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to operate with an internal variable `t` which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, but the specific output or return value is not provided.**
