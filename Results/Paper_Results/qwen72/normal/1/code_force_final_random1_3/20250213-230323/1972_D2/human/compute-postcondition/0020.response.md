Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 2, `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
