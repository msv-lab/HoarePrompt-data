Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 4.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `y` was the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.
- The code snippet `y = 1` changes the value of `y` to 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `n` must be at least 4 remains valid.
- The description of `cnt` remains the same, as it depends on the conditions involving `x` and `y`, which are now updated.
