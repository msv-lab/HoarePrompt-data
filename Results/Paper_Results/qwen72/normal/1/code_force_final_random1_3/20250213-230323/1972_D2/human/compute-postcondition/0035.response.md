Output State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is increased by 1, and `cnt` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since the code snippet only modifies `y`, the conditions on `n` and `m` and the value of `x` remain as they were in the initial state. The variable `cnt` is not affected by the given code snippet, so it also remains unchanged.
