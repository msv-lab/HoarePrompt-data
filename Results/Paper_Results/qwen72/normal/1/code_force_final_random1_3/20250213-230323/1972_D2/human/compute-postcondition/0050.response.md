To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 3
- `n` must be at least 28
- `m` must be at least 21
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `x + y`:**
   - `x + y = 4 + 3 = 7`

2. **Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:**
   - `(x + y) * x = 7 * 4 = 28`
   - `(x + y) * y = 7 * 3 = 21`

3. **Check conditions:**
   - `(x + y) * x <= n` (28 <= n) is true since `n` is at least 28.
   - `(x + y) * y <= m` (21 <= m) is true since `m` is at least 21.
   - `gcd(x, y) == 1` (gcd(4, 3) == 1) is true.

4. **Calculate the minimum value:**
   - `n / ((x + y) * x) = n / 28`
   - `m // ((x + y) * y) = m // 21`

   Since `n` is at least 28 and `m` is at least 21:
   - `n / 28` is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 28)
   - `m // 21` is at least 1 (since `m` is at least 21)

   Therefore, `min(n / 28, m // 21)` is 1.

5. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt += min(n / 28, m // 21)`
   - `cnt += 1`

### Output State:
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 3
- `n` must be at least 28
- `m` must be at least 21
- `cnt` is incremented by 1

Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 28, `m` must be at least 21, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
