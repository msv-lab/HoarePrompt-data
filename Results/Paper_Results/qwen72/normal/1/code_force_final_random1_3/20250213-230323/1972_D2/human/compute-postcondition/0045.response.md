To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Current State:
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is at least 20
- `m` is at least 5

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` with the current values:**
   - `x + y = 4 + 2 = 6`
   - `(x + y) * x = 6 * 4 = 24`
   - `(x + y) * y = 6 * 2 = 12`

2. **Check the conditions:**
   - `(x + y) * x <= n` becomes `24 <= n`
   - `(x + y) * y <= m` becomes `12 <= m`

3. **Determine if the conditions are met:**
   - Given `n` is at least 20, `24 <= n` is true.
   - Given `m` is at least 5, `12 <= m` is true.

Since both conditions are true, the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust any states.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. `n` is at least 20, and `m` is at least 5.**
