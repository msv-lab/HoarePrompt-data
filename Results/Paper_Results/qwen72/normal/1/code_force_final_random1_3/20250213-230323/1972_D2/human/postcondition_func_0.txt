The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. It then calculates the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `1 <= x, y`, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The function prints the count of such pairs. The final state of the program is that the count of valid pairs has been computed and printed.
