The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the value `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given that `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4, this already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, for clarity, we can restate the condition that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
