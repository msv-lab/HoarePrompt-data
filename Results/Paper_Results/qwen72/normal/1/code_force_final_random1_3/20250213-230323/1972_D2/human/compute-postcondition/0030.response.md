Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 6` and `m // 3` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 8, m // 8)`.***
