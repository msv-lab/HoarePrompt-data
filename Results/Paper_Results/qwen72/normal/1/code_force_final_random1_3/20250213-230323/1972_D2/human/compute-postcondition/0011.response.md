The value of `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of two expressions: `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Given the initial values of `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, the expressions simplify to:

- `n / ((1 + 2) * 1)` which simplifies to `n / 3`
- `m // ((1 + 2) * 2)` which simplifies to `m // 6`

So, `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.**
