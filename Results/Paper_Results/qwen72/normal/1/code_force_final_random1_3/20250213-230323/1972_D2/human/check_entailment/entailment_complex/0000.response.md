Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input as specified in the problem statement. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required.

2. **Pair Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` to ensure that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - If the conditions are met, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

3. **Condition Verification**:
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is implicitly checked by the logic in `func_1`. The pairs `(x, y)` are selected such that `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and the constraints `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` ensure that the pairs are within the valid range.
   - The calculation of `cnt` using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each `(x, y)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described.

Correctness: **True**
