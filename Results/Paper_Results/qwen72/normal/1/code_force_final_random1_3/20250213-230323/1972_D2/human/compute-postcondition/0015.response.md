To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - For the first condition: \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
     - Substituting the current values: \((1 + 3) * 1 = 4 \leq n\)
     - This condition is true if \(n \geq 4\).

   - For the second condition: \((x + y) * y \leq m\)
     - Substituting the current values: \((1 + 3) * 3 = 12 \leq m\)
     - This condition is true if \(m \geq 12\).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4, and `m` must be at least 12.

### Conclusion:
Since the current state already satisfies these conditions (as `n` and `m` are positive integers within the given range), no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`**.
