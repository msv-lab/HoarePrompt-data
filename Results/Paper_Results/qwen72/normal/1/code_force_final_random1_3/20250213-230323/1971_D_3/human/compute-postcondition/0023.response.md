Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is a binary string of length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is updated to a new input binary string, `j` is 2, `len(s)` must be greater than 3. If the first two characters of `s` are different, `count` is 3. If `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', `flag` is True. If `s[1]` is different from `s[2]`, `count` is 4. If `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', `flag` is True and `count` is 3 or 4 depending on the conditions specified. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
