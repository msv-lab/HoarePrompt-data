Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is updated to a new input binary string, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different minus 1, and `flag` remains True. If `flag` is False, `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
