The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500). It then calculates the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`. If there is at least one '0' followed immediately by '1', the count is reduced by 1. The function prints the calculated count for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value.
