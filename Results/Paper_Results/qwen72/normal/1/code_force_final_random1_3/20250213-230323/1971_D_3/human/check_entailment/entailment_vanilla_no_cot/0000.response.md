Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. The program counts the number of changes between `0` and `1` in the string and adjusts the count based on whether there is a transition from `0` to `1`. This approach ensures that the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string is calculated correctly. The adjustments and logic used in the program align with the requirements of the problem statement.
