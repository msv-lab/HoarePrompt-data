Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is updated to a new input binary string, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different minus 1, and `flag` remains True. If `flag` is False, `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, indicating there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed immediately by '1' in `s`, then `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different minus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different, and `flag` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `count` is the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s` plus 1, and `flag` is True if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string `s`. If `flag` is True, then `count` is the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
