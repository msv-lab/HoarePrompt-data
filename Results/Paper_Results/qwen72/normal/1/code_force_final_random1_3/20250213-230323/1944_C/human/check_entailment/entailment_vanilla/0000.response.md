### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
   - The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and iterates through the elements, checking if the current `start` value is present in the array.
   - If `start` is present, it is added to a set `vis` and its count in the `Counter` is decremented.
   - If `start + 1` is also present, it is decremented and `start` is incremented.
   - The loop continues until `start` is no longer present in the array, at which point `start + 1` is printed as the MEX.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible numbers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to exclude the smallest possible numbers to minimize the MEX.
   - The algorithm correctly simulates this by decrementing the counts of the smallest available numbers and moving to the next smallest number when possible.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains repeated elements.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The algorithm correctly computes the MEX for the given examples.
   - The logic of decrementing the counts and moving to the next smallest number ensures that the MEX is computed optimally.

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
