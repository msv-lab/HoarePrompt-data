Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. If `start` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 2` and `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 1`. If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 2` and `nums[3]` is now `nums[3] - 1`. `start` is either 1 or 2. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[start + 1]` is decremented by 1.
- If `start` is 1, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 1`.
- If `start` is 2, `nums[3]` is now `nums[3] - 1`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
