#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr), and the length of arr is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

    start = 0

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object where the frequencies of the integers in `arr` have been adjusted according to the loop's operations. Specifically, for each integer `i` that was visited (`i` in `vis`), `nums[i]` has been decremented by 1, and if `i + 1` was also visited, `nums[i + 1]` has been decremented by 1. The variable `start` will be the last index that was processed before the loop terminated, and `vis` will contain all the indices that were visited during the loop's execution. If the loop completes without encountering a condition where `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, it will print `start + 1` and terminate.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: n - 1 (where n is the length of the list `arr`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element is between 0 and the length of the list minus one. It processes the list to track the occurrences of each integer using a `Counter` object named `nums`. The function iterates through the list, decrementing the count of certain integers based on a specific pattern and tracking the visited integers in a set `vis`. If at any point the function encounters an integer `start` such that `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and terminates. If the loop completes, it prints the last processed index `start`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `nums` counter will reflect the decremented counts of the integers that were processed, and the set `vis` will contain the indices that were visited. The final state of `nums` and `vis` depends on the initial contents of `arr` and the sequence of operations performed during the loop.
