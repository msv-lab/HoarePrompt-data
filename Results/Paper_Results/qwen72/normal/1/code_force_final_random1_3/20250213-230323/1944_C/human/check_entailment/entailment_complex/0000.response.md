### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited elements.
   - The loop continues until `nums.get(start, 0)` is zero, meaning the current `start` value is no longer present in the array.
   - In each iteration, it adds `start` to the `vis` set and decrements the count of `start` in `nums`.
   - If `start + 1` is present in `nums`, it decrements the count of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` is not present, it prints `start + 1` and returns.
   - If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, it prints `start`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `arr` after both players have played optimally.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally by always choosing the smallest available integer that can affect the MEX.
   - The use of `Counter` and the loop structure correctly simulate the game's rules and constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as arrays with repeated elements and arrays where the MEX is 0.
   - The function also handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` constructed by Alice and Bob playing optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
