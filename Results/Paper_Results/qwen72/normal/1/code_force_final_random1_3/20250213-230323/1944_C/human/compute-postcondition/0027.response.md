Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. If `start` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 2`. If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 2`. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, then `nums[start + 1]` is now `nums[start + 1] - 1` and `start` is now either 2 or 3. The set `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.***
