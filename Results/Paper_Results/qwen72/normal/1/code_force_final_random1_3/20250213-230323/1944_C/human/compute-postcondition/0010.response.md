Based on the initial state:

- `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`).
- The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is a set containing the element 0.
- `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is 0, meaning that the integer `start + 1` (which is 1) does not exist in the `nums` Counter object.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

Let's break down the values:
- `start` is 0.
- `start + 1` is 0 + 1, which equals 1.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value 1.

Output: **1**
