Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element is between 0 and the length of the list minus one. It processes the list to track the occurrences of each integer using a `Counter` object named `nums`. The function iterates through the list, decrementing the count of certain integers based on a specific pattern and tracking the visited integers in a set `vis`. If at any point the function encounters an integer `start` such that `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and terminates. If the loop completes, it prints the last processed index `start`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `nums` counter will reflect the decremented counts of the integers that were processed, and the set `vis` will contain the indices that were visited. The final state of `nums` and `vis` depends on the initial contents of `arr` and the sequence of operations performed during the loop. **
