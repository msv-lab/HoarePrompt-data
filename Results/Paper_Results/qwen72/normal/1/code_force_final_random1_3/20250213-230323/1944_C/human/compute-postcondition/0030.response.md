The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element satisfies 0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr), and the length of `arr` is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

Output:
- **Case_1:** The program returns `None`.
- **Case_2:** The program does not return any value.
- **Case_3:** The program does not return any value. However, it modifies the list `nums` such that `nums[0]` is decreased by 1. If `start` is 1, then `nums[1]` is decreased by 2. If `start` is 2, then `nums[2]` is decreased by 2. Additionally, the set `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and may modify a list `nums` and a set `vis`. It either returns `None` or does not return any value. If modifications occur, `nums[0]` is decreased by 1, and depending on the value of `start`, `nums[1]` or `nums[2]` may be decreased by 2. The set `vis` will contain the elements 0 and 1.**
