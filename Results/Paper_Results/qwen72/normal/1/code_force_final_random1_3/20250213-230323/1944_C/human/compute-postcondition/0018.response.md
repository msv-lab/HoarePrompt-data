Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without specifying any value to return. This means the function will end and return `None` by default in Python. The modifications to `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` as well as the contents of the `vis` set and the value of `start` do not affect the return value since no value is explicitly returned.
