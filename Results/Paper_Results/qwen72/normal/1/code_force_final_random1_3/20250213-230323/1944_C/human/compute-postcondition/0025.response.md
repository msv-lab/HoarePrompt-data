Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element satisfies `0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr)`.
- The length of `arr` is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `nums[0]` is decremented by 1.
- If `start` is 1, `nums[1]` is decremented by 2.
- If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is decremented by 2.
- `start` is either 1 or 2.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1 (note that sets do not contain duplicate elements, so `vis` effectively contains {0, 1}).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `start` is either 1 or 2.
- The code snippet simply adds 1 to the value of `start` and prints the result.

### Possible Values:
- If `start` is 1, then `start + 1` will be 2.
- If `start` is 2, then `start + 1` will be 3.

### Conclusion:
Since `start` is either 1 or 2, the output will be either 2 or 3.

Output: **2 or 3 (depending on the value of `start`)**
