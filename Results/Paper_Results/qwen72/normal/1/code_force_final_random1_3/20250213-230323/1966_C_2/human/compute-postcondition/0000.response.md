The code snippet `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles.
- A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `tc` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is within the range 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4.
- The initial state information about `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
