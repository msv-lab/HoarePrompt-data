The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1`, otherwise `dp` is False**
