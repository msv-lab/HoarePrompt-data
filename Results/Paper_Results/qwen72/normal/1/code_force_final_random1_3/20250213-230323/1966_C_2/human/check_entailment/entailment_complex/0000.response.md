Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the game theory problem where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing stones from piles under specific rules. The key to determining the winner lies in the parity of the differences between the sizes of the piles. Specifically, the logic hinges on whether any difference between consecutive unique, sorted pile sizes (excluding the last 0) is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, Alice can always force a win; otherwise, Bob will win.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Processing the Pile Sizes**:
   - The pile sizes are converted to a set to remove duplicates, then sorted in descending order, and a 0 is appended to the end of the list. This ensures that the smallest pile size is considered in the comparison.
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, which will be used to track the winning condition.

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of unique pile sizes (excluding the last 0).
   - For each pair of consecutive elements, it checks if the difference is greater than 1. If so, it sets `dp` to `True`, indicating that Alice can force a win.
   - If no such difference is found, `dp` remains `False`, indicating that Bob will win.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

The logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the game theory solution. The use of a set to remove duplicates and sorting in descending order ensures that the differences are checked efficiently. The condition for Alice's win (any difference greater than 1) is correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
