Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
