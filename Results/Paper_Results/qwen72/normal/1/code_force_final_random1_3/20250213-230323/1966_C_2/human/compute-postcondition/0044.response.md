Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 3, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is the result of the expression `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or ... or arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not True`.** 

Explanation: The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, so its new value is one less than its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.
