Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is `arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not True`**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is `n`, the condition checks if the difference between the last element of `arr` (which is `arr[n]`) and the element after it (which is `arr[n + 1]` and is 0) is greater than 1. If this difference is greater than 1, `dp` becomes `True`. Otherwise, `dp` becomes the negation of its previous value, which was `True`, making it `False`. Therefore, `dp` is now `True` if `arr[n] - 0 > 1`, otherwise `dp` is `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
