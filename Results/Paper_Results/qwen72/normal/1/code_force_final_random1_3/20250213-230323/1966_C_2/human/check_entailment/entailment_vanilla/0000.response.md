### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile.
   - The key to winning is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty).
   - The optimal strategy involves removing the maximum possible number of stones from each non-empty pile in such a way that the opponent is left with a losing position.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game state can be simplified by considering the distinct sizes of the piles. This is because removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile reduces the problem to a smaller set of distinct pile sizes.
   - The game is essentially a Nim-like game where the number of distinct pile sizes determines the outcome.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
   - It then sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a zero to handle edge cases.
   - The program uses a boolean variable `dp` to track the winning state. Initially, `dp` is set to `True`, indicating that Alice starts the game.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted pile sizes and updates `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
   - If the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, or if the current `dp` value is `False`, the `dp` value is toggled.
   - Finally, the program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic of the program correctly identifies the winning player by considering the distinct pile sizes and their differences.
   - The use of `dp` to track the winning state is appropriate for this type of game.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
