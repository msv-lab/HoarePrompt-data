Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is updated to the length of `arr` minus 1.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `arr`, `i`, `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
