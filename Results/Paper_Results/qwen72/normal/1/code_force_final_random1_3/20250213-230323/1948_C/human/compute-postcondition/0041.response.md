To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from the range specified.
- `n`: This determines the upper limit of the range.

For the loop to execute, the range `range(1, n, 2)` must contain at least one value. This means that `n` must be greater than 1, because the smallest value `i` can take is 1, and the step size is 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string (not relevant to the loop head).
- `b` is an input string (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even (this is not the same `i` as in the loop head).
- `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues if `_` is less than `t` (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).

The only relevant variables to adjust for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` is the loop variable and will be set by the `range` function, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
