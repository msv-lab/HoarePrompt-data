Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly; they are part of the context but do not change the literal string being printed.

Output: **No**
