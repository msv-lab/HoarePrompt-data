Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 5, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.***
