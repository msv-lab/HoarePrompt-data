The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be at least 4
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is an input string
- `i` is 3

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **No**
